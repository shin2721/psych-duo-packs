    "title": "The effects of cognitive interventions on quality of life in infertile women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Infertility can lead to significant psychological distress, including depression and anxiety, adversely affecting the quality of life and treatment outcomes for affected women. This study systematically reviews non-pharmacological interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), aimed at improving quality of life, mental health, and birth rates among infertile women. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases (PUBMED/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and ULAKB&#x130;M) up to 22 February 2025, following PRISMA guidelines, with registration in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023457742). The analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on CBT, with quality of life as the primary outcome. Eight studies involving 687 women met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis results revealed significant enhancements in quality of life (SMD: 1.97), alongside notable reductions in depression (SMD: -3.34) and anxiety (MD: -2.09). Additionally, a positive trend in pregnancy rates was observed (MD: 0.48). Despite the promising findings, the overall quality of evidence was deemed low to moderate due to potential biases. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of CBT in improving mental health and quality of life in infertile women, highlighting the need for further high-quality research to validate these outcomes and endorse cognitive interventions in infertility treatment.",

    "title": "The effect of virtual immersion in nature on hospitalization stress in psychiatric patients: A randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Stress is not only a transdiagnostic risk factor for depressive and anxiety disorders but is also closely associated with disease relapse and treatment compliance in psychiatric care. The lack of access to nature in closed psychiatric wards may exacerbate patients' perceived stress, while virtual reality (VR)-based immersive nature technology offers an innovative solution. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a short-term, low-dose VR nature immersion protocol (10&#xa0;min per day for 3 consecutive days) on hospitalized psychiatric patients in China. This study employed a randomized controlled trial design, enrolling 60 inpatients diagnosed with depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Seven participants withdrew, leaving 27 in the VR nature group and 26 in the VR city control group. Intervention effects were measured using multidimensional indicators, including psychological scales, physiological indicators, and immediate emotion. The VR nature group exhibited significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety, along with significantly increased connectedness to nature. Physiological data indicated that the VR nature group had significantly lower heart rates compared to the control group. After a single VR session, the VR nature group demonstrated a significant improvement in positive emotions and a marked reduction in negative emotions. This research provides evidence that short-term VR nature immersion effectively alleviates stress and emotional in hospitalized psychiatric patients. The consistent results across psychological, physiological, and immediate emotional indicators validate its efficacy. The proposed lightweight protocol is both clinically feasible and safe, offering a new pathway for stress intervention in closed psychiatric wards.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is prevalent in older age and in patients with depression, which may limit the efficacy of psychotherapy for late-life depression (LLD). We analyzed the effect of age and baseline cognition on the efficacy of psychotherapy in LLD. This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled multicenter study included 213 participants (60-92&#xa0;years) with moderate to severe depression who had received either supportive psychotherapy (SUI) or an LLD-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (LLD-CBT), both of which led to a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms. We examined the influence of age and baseline cognition, assessed with the CERAD-plus neuropsychological battery, on changes in the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at the end of treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03735576) and DRKS (DRKS00013769). Baseline cognition was slightly below norms (&lt;1SD), with 15&#xa0;% of patients meeting criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). GDS change at the end of treatment was not significantly associated with baseline cognition or MCI status, although additional interaction analyses suggest that, in the SUI group, lower baseline cognitive performance was associated with reduced treatment efficacy at follow-up only. Additionally, we found that higher age predicted a smaller reduction in GDS scores both at end-of-treatment and at follow-up in both treatment groups. Higher age, but not lower cognitive performance, was associated with reduced psychotherapy efficacy. Thus, age-related factors should be considered in psychotherapy.",

    "title": "Efficacy of stimulus discrimination training for reducing unwanted memories in student journalists.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Journalists are frequently exposed to traumatic images and events, which may contribute to poor mental health, especially in those starting in the profession. Evidence-based preventative tools are needed to reduce the effects of exposure to these occupational stressors. Previous research demonstrates that the strategy journalists most commonly apply to traumatic images is suppression.<b>Objective:</b> This experiment investigated whether stimulus discrimination, a technique used in cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD; Ehlers et al., 2005. Cognitive therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder: development and evaluation. <i>Behaviour Research and Therapy</i>, <i>43</i>(4), 413-431) for reducing intrusive trauma memories, is more effective than memory suppression.<b>Methods:</b> Student journalists were randomly allocated to one session of online training in stimulus discrimination (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;34; Mage&#x2009;=&#x2009;23.65, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.18; 24 female) or suppression (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;34; Mage&#x2009;=&#x2009;24.26, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.55; 24 female) before exposure to analogue trauma film clips. Participants then completed daily diaries of intrusive memories of the film clips for one week and completed PTSD symptom measures at one-week follow-up.<b>Results:</b> Compared to participants trained in memory suppression, those trained in stimulus discrimination reported significantly fewer intrusive memories, less distress associated with intrusions and lower PTSD symptom severity at follow-up. There were no training-specific effects associated with depression or resilience at follow-up.<b>Conclusions:</b> The study found that student journalists can be trained in stimulus discrimination and that this CT-PTSD tool significantly reduced intrusive memories and associated PTSD symptoms after post-training exposure to traumatic images. Working as a journalist can involve exposure to traumatic events and increase risk for mental ill health.Journalists most often respond to intrusions of stressful experiences using strategies, such as memory suppression, that are understandable but may be unhelpful.Training journalists in stimulus discrimination prior to exposure to analogue trauma led to significantly fewer intrusive memories, less associated distress and fewer self-reported PTSD symptoms at 1 week follow-up compared to journalists trained in memory suppression.Stimulus discrimination effectively reduced intrusive memories and associated symptoms.Stimulus discrimination may offer protective benefits against developing PTSD and may have promise as a prevention tool. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Los periodistas est&#xe1;n con frecuencia expuestos a im&#xe1;genes y eventos traum&#xe1;ticos, lo que puede contribuir a un deterioro de la salud mental, especialmente en quienes reci&#xe9;n comienzan en la profesi&#xf3;n.

    "abstract": "Caffeine (CAF) and taurine (TAU) have each demonstrated ergogenic effects across physical and cognitive domains. Often co-formulated in commercial energy drinks, they are widely regarded as the two principal bioactive compounds. However, findings regarding their combined efficacy remain inconclusive. This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis aimed to quantify the individual and combined effects of CAF and TAU on physical capacity, cognitive function, and physiological responses, with a focus on identifying potential synergistic or antagonistic interactions. Cochrane Library, PubMed, SciELO, SportsDiscus-EBSCO and Web of Science were searched through 25 July 2025. The pooled effect of each outcome was summarized using SMD (Hedge's g) by Bayesian arm-based multilevel network meta-analysis, and SUCRA ranking was applied to estimate the relative treatment effect. Twelve studies were included (8 on physical capacity, 7 on blood lactate (B[la]), and 6 each on cognitive function, heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE)). Posterior estimates indicated that CAF+TAU was associated with a credible positive effect on anaerobic capacity (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46, 95% CrI [0.19, 0.71]) and reaction time (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.75, 95% CrI [0.29, 1.18]) compared to CAF or TAU alone. CAF showed the greatest posterior reduction in RPE (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.64, 95% CrI [-1.20, -0.10]), while its posterior mean estimate suggested a potential increase in B[la] (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.24, 95% CrI [-0.48, 0.96]). In contrast, TAU showed a possible tendency toward reducing B[la] (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.30, 95% CrI [-1.01, 0.42]). No credible differences in HR were observed across conditions. Effects on aerobic performance and physiological measures were variable and appeared to be context-dependent. SUCRA rankings consistently favored CAF+TAU across most outcome domains. CAF+TAU co-supplementation provides a balanced ergogenic effect, combining the central stimulation of CAF with the neuromodulatory and metabolic support of TAU, particularly beneficial for high-intensity, reaction-based tasks. Its effects on endurance and physiological indices vary by condition, highlighting the need for personalized application.",

However, most previous studies were conducted under fasted conditions, which may not accurately reflect the typical practices of athletes who generally consume food before intense exercise or competition. This study examined the effects of CHO, CAF, and CHO+CAF mouth rinses on physiological and perceptual responses during high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) following a pre-exercise meal. Twelve recreationally active males (age: 23.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.2&#x2009;years) completed four HIIE trials involving 8 bouts of 1-min cycling at 85% of peak power output (PPO), separated by 1-min active recovery at 20% of PPO. Using a double-blinded randomized crossover design, participants rinsed with either 10% maltodextrin (CHO), 1.2% caffeine (CAF), 10% maltodextrin&#x2009;+&#x2009;1.2% caffeine (CHO+CAF), or water (PLA) twice in each trial (after warm-up and interval 4). All solutions were taste-matched using the artificial sweetener sucralose. A standardized CHO-rich (1&#x2009;g&#xb7;kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight) breakfast was provided an hour before testing.

However, direct evidence demonstrating its superiority over traditional refueling guidelines has been lacking. This exploratory study compared a CGM-informed protocol with a traditional interval-based (TRAD) carbohydrate refueling protocol on endurance exercise responses. Twelve healthy, non-diabetic males (age&#x2009;=&#x2009;32.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.3&#x2009;years) participated in two trials involving 75&#x2009;minutes of continuous cycling at 50% peak power output, with the two carbohydrate refueling protocols implemented in a randomized, crossover order. In the TRAD protocol, participants received standard carbohydrate solutions at regular 15-min intervals, while replenishment timing in the CGM-informed protocol was guided by real-time glucose trends, particularly during declines. No significant differences were observed in heart rate, blood lactate, or perceived exertion between conditions (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). However, CGM-informed protocol displayed a lower coefficient of variation of glucose levels (8.82&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.68%) than the TRAD protocol (11.95&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.41%, Cohen's d &#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013), indicating a steadier blood glucose trend.

    "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is a potential biomarker for frailty, which is burdensome in older adults. However, existing studies report inconsistent findings regarding their relationship, and no meta-analysis has been conducted. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to examine the association between HRV and frailty, as well as the boundary conditions that influence this relationship. We systematically searched eight databases for studies examining three domains of HRV parameters - time-, frequency-, and nonlinear-domain - and their associations with frailty. Using a three-level random-effects meta-analytic model, we investigated the pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) for short-term (&#x2264; 5 minutes) and long-term (24-hour) HRV, and potential variables moderating the relationship between HRV and frailty. We included 16 studies (n = 2365) in the review from 1132 records, and 13 of them were meta-analyzed (n = 1677) contributing 90 effect sizes. Both short-term (7 studies, 47 effect sizes) and long-term (6 studies, 43 effect sizes) models indicated lower HRV in (pre)frail individuals compared to their non-frail counterparts, while the effects were not statistically significant. For long-term HRV, the relationship was moderated by HRV domain: time-domain parameters exhibited a larger effect size (g = 2.097) than frequency-domain parameters (g = 1.698). Our meta-analyses revealed a trend towards lower HRV in (pre)frail individuals; however, the effects in both models were not statistically significant. Although HRV may be a potential biomarker of frailty, the current evidence remains inconclusive. Further prospective studies are necessary, considering the heterogeneity and potential publication bias observed.",

    "abstract": "To enhance cognitive intervention effectiveness, we developed MMNCE-integrating music-based exercise, multi-domain cognitive training with neurostimulation, and emotion-regulation education-grounded in cognitive aging theories. In this three-arm RCT, we compared MMNCE with cognitive training plus sham neurostimulation (MCS) and a non-intervention control (NIC) among cognitively healthy (CH) and cognitively impaired (CI) older adults. A total of 166 participants (mean age: 68.95&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.27; 70 CI) from community centers in Xuzhou, China, were randomized. Cognitive outcomes (MoCA and executive function) were assessed at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. At 12 weeks, 124 participants completed the intervention. Independent of the baseline cognitive status, compared to NIC, MMNCE showed larger effect sizes than MCS, with significant improvements in MoCA total scores and domains, including visuospatial ability, naming, attention, abstract reasoning, and episodic memory (&#x3b7;&#xb2;<sub>p</sub> = 0.15 to 0.54).

In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, 60 patients with schizophrenia (36 men, 24 women) were randomized to receive either four sessions of VR-CBT or traditional CBT, in addition to pharmacological treatment. The VR environment simulated a bus trip with 11 neutral-faced avatars. Outcomes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; positive symptom subscale), the Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS), and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Eyes Test) at baseline and post-treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Both groups showed significant improvements in all measures (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05).

No adverse effects were reported. VR-CBT appears to be a promising adjunct to standard treatment for recent-onset schizophrenia, offering superior improvements in positive symptoms, paranoia, and ToM compared to traditional CBT.

PTSD participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;91) were randomly assigned to EMD (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;47) or retrieval-only conditions (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;44). Baseline and post-treatment data were collected and measured using Heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR), pre-ejection period (PEP), and cortisol levels (AUC; the area under the curve, and CAR; the cortisol awakening response). We conducted a linear mixed model to analyze the main outcomes. No difference between EMD and retrieval-only in the reduction of stress reactivity and acceleration of recovery over time. Both groups showed that HR and PEP reactivity to the trauma script decreased significantly after treatment. In contrast, only EMD group experienced an acceleration of HR recovery in response to trauma scripts following treatment. Cortisol measures showed an inconsistent pattern, with a higher CAR in retrieval-only after treatment compared to EMD. However, no significant difference was found between groups in terms of AUC levels after treatment. The precision of measuring and analyzing saliva samples is highly dependent on the participant's adherence to the schedule. No specific benefits for eye movements was found in the current study. Both EMDR and retrieval-only can reduce stress reactivity in treating PTSD. [www. gov], identifier [ISRCTN55239132].",

    "title": "Painful, but necessary: a qualitative process evaluation on patient experiences with modified prolonged exposure as early intervention after rape (the EIR study).",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Early trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy may help reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms in individuals recently exposed to sexual assault. In Norway, specialized Sexual Assault Centres (SACs) provide psychosocial support to survivors of sexual assault, yet the effectiveness of these services remains uncertain. The Early Intervention after Rape (EIR) study is a multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of modified prolonged exposure therapy (mPE) compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in alleviating post-traumatic stress symptoms shortly after rape.<b>Objective:</b> This qualitative study explores patients' experiences with participating in the EIR study and receiving mPE as early psychosocial intervention at three SACs in Norway.<b>Method:</b> We interviewed 15 patients, 10 receiving mPE and five receiving TAU.<b>Results:</b> Thematic analysis revealed that patients found participation in the EIR study beneficial and meaningful, and that it was facilitated by a respectful and a trauma-competent research team. Patients favoured psychosocial support that directly addressed the traumatic event over non-specific focus on everyday concerns and recommended integrating mPE into the SAC's psychosocial support services.<b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides insights into the experiences of women receiving psychosocial support at SACs after recent sexual assault. It highlights clinical and practical challenges in implementing a novel intervention and conducting a multisite RCT, whilst at the same time identifying opportunities to enhance evidence-based support, ensuring alignment with survivors' preferences and recovery process. Modified Prolonged Exposure (mPE) is perceived as beneficial by recent rape survivors and is recommended for integration into support services at Sexual Assault Centres (SACs).Augmenting psychosocial support with trauma-focused interventions that facilitate safe disclosure may enhance outcome for survivors.Research involving recently sexually assaulted individuals is well-tolerated and provides valuable insights for improving intervention strategies. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La terapia cognitivo-conductual temprana centrada en el trauma puede ayudar a reducir los s&#xed;ntomas de estr&#xe9;s postraum&#xe1;tico en individuos recientemente expuestos a una agresi&#xf3;n sexual.

    "abstract": "This randomized controlled trial explored the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of integrating mindfulness-based body scan (MBBS) interventions into multimodal pelvic floor physiotherapy for vulvodynia treatment. Participants received ten sessions of standardized physiotherapy. The mindfulness intervention group was instructed to additionally perform home-based audio-file guided MBBS five times a week. The primary study endpoint was feasibility. The effect on pain intensity, pain characteristics and sexuality were assessed with Numeric Rating scales (NRS), the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and digital assessment of pelvic floor. Thirty-three women were randomized and completed the end-of-treatment assessments and 26 (79%) attended the follow-up. 15 of 17 participants of the intervention group (88%) performed the body scans more than ten times and the feasibility criteria were achieved. The intervention group showed significantly better improvements in NRS of average pain, MPQ subscales and FSDS total score. Pelvic floor assessment showed a significant improvement of myofascial pressure points over time with no difference between study groups. Integration of MBBS trainings into multimodal pelvic floor physiotherapy for vulvodynia is feasible and well accepted and may improve pain reduction and sexual function.",

    "abstract": "Digital just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), or interventions that can be offered in a context when support is needed most, represent a promising development for improving scalable, personalized interventions. However, the comparative efficacy of specific JITAIs has yet to be examined. The present study examines engagement with and usefulness of JITAIs provided through a mental health application, Youper. This study uses data from Youper users (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;8323) collected between July and October of 2020. Users were randomized to one of nine cognitive or behavioral interventions, although the present study examined interactions with only six cognitive interventions (e.g., gratitude, mindfulness, cognitive restructuring). If users engaged with the intervention, they subsequently rated its helpfulness. Engagement was examined with logistic regression and user-rated helpfulness of JITAIs was explored through a multi-level model. A secondary analysis examined whether pre-intervention emotions moderated the results. Compared to acceptance-based interventions, users had significantly greater odds of engaging with cognitive restructuring, problem-solving, self-compassion, and gratitude interventions (all ps&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), but significantly lower odds of engaging with mindfulness-based interventions (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). Cognitive restructuring, gratitude, mindfulness, and problem-solving were rated as more helpful than acceptance (all ps&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). There was a non-significant difference between perceived helpfulness of self-compassion and acceptance (p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;.05). Pre-intervention emotions did not moderate effects (p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;.05). These results suggest that JITAIs, which can be implemented at the moment when users most need support, are helpful emotion regulation tools.",

    "title": "Cognitive behavioral therapies are evidence-based - based on what? A systematic review and meta-analysis of recent randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioral therapies for depression.",
    "abstract": "We aimed to map the last five years' randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) for depression to determine what types of CBTs are currently being investigated and how they are evaluated. As per the pre-registration (Prospero; #CRD42023427902), RCTs of CBTs for depression (2019 through 2023) were identified from searches in PubMed and PsycINFO. We reviewed the type of CBT, outcome (e.g., positive outcomes, neuropsychological performance), frequency, and efficacy, in addition to the assessment of moderation, mediation, and adverse events. 78 records, representing 62 independent samples, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. CBTs were most often of a contemporary type (51&#xa0;%) and the mean attrition rate post-treatment was 21&#xa0;%. Fifty-nine studies (95&#xa0;%) included a measure of depressive symptoms. Positive (74&#xa0;%) and negative outcomes (65&#xa0;%) were also frequently investigated. Harm and adverse events were evaluated in 40 studies (65&#xa0;%). The post-treatment effects were of medium-to-large magnitudes (Hedges' g: 0.51 to 0.81). At follow-up, the effect either remained of the same size or decreased to a small magnitude. No differences were observed between classic (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.52) and contemporary (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.60) CBTs. These results show the current landscape of RCTs of CBT for depression, revealing what clients can expect in terms of effects and what researchers are currently emphasizing - and ignoring - in trial evaluations. The findings may guide future studies in closing the gaps in current research. The present study was limited to samples with a formal diagnosis of depression and superiority trials, and results should be interpreted accordingly.",

    "title": "Low-dose caffeine enhances cognitive processing but not physical performance in fatigued taekwondo athletes: a randomized crossover trial.",
    "abstract": "Caffeine is commonly used to combat fatigue and enhance both cognitive and physical performance. However, its effects on neurophysiological responses and sport-specific performance following fatigue induction remain unclear, particularly in combat sports such as Taekwondo. This study investigated the effects of a 200&#x2009;mg caffeine dose on physiological markers, electroencephalographic (EEG) brainwave activity, auditory P300 event-related potentials (ERPs), and Taekwondo-specific performance following combined mental and physical fatigue. Thirteen male Taekwondo athletes participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with caffeine (CAF) and placebo (PLA) conditions. Measurements were taken at baseline (pre-supplementation), 30&#x2009;minutes post-supplementation (post-Sup), and after fatigue induction (post-I). Physiological parameters (heart rate, blood glucose, blood lactate, and ratings of perceived exertion), EEG brainwave activity during resting eyes-open conditions, auditory P300 ERPs, and Taekwondo-specific agility (TSAT) were assessed at all time points. Caffeine significantly reduced delta wave power at frontal and parieto-occipital sites at post-Sup (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), indicating decreased cortical drowsiness; however, this effect was not sustained at post-I (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). P300 amplitude significantly increased in the CAF condition compared to PLA from post-Sup to post-I at the central and parietal electrode sites (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), while P300 latency remained unchanged (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). No significant differences were observed in reaction time, accuracy, or error rate in the auditory oddball task or TSAT performance across conditions (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Similarly, physiological parameters remained unchanged between groups (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). A single 200&#x2009;mg dose of caffeine reduced central fatigue and enhanced cognitive processing, as reflected by suppressed delta wave activity at post-Sup and increased P300 amplitude at post-I. However, caffeine did not influence physiological responses or Taekwondo-specific performance. These findings suggest that low-dose caffeine primarily benefits cognitive function rather than physical performance in combat sports. Future studies should explore dose-response relationships and individual variability in caffeine metabolism to optimize its application in competitive settings.",

    "abstract": "Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have working memory (WM) impairment, which can be improved by virtual reality-based working memory (VR-WM) training; however, the specific neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify how VR-WM training improves WM in patients with MDD and further explore the role of the frontotemporal lobe in related neural mechanisms. A total of 57 patients with MDD were included in a randomized controlled study to clarify the effects of 20 sessions of VR-WM training on WM in patients with MDD and to explore the role of the frontotemporal lobe in associated neural mechanisms. The Stroop color word test, 2-back task, digit task switching, and digit span test were used to measure the inhibition, updating and switching functions of WM and WM span. The functional features of the frontotemporal lobe in patients with MDD at rest were detected using functional near-infrared spectroscopy before and after training. After VR-WM training, patients with MDD exhibited significant improvements in the accuracy of the Stroop color word test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013) and 2-back task (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), the scores of digit span test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006). Significant group-by-time interactions of local efficiency (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005) and clustering coefficient (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004) of the frontotemporal lobe were observed between groups. The degree of improvement in the total score of the digit span test was positively correlated with the change in the clustering coefficient (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034). VR-WM training effectively improved inhibition, updating and memory span in the WM of patients with MDD. Furthermore, VR-WM training was observed to enhance functional connectivity in the frontotemporal lobe, thereby improving WM performance in patients with MDD.",

    "title": "Use of view-adjustable video laryngeal mask versus endotracheal intubation for airway management during anaesthesia for arthroscopic surgery: a randomized trial.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the practicality and efficacy of utilizing a view-adjustable video laryngeal mask (SafeLM) versus endotracheal intubation (ETI) in the context of arthroscopic shoulder surgery. A randomized controlled trial enrolled 100 patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery, randomly assigned to the SafeLM group (<i>n</i> = 50) or ETI group (<i>n</i> = 50). The primary outcome measure was hemodynamic parameters, while mechanical ventilation parameters, complications, and the quality of anaesthesia recovery were considered as secondary outcomes. These parameters were then compared between the two groups. During the intubation and extubation procedures, the SafeLM group demonstrated significantly lower mean arterial pressure and heart rate compared to the ETI group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Furthermore, the airway pressure at T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> was notably lower in the SafeLM group compared to the ETI group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). However, there were no statistically significant differences in oxygen saturation observed between the two groups at any time point. Both groups were equally capable of quickly establishing a surgical airway when necessary. Notably, a smaller proportion of patients in the SafeLM group exhibited negative reactions during tube removal. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of post-operative sore throat, difficulty swallowing, choking, and coughing between the two groups (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The utilization of SafeLM may result in enhanced regulation of blood pressure and heart rate among patients who undergo arthroscopic surgery for the shoulder while in the side decubitus position. Compared with endotracheal intubation (ETI) group, view-adjustable video laryngeal mask (SafeLM) group had smaller changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during the intubation and extubation phase (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).In supine and lateral decubitus position, the airway pressure (AP) in the SafeLM group is significantly lower than in the ETI group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).There were no statistically significant differences in oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>) observed between the two groups at any time point during the surgical procedure (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.050).During the extubation phase, cough choking was significantly lower in the SafeLM group than in the ETI group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).Compared with endotracheal intubation (ETI) group, the occurrence of post-operative sore throat, difficulty swallowing, choking, and coughing in the SafeLM group are significantly lower than in the ETI group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).Compared with endotracheal intubation (ETI) group, patients in the SafeLM group being more satisfied (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).",

    "abstract": "<b>ABSTRACT</b><b>Background:</b> Prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugees is higher compared to the general population, and barriers in accessing mental health care are often experienced. With staggering numbers of people seeking refuge around the world, and 40% being 18 years or younger, effective trauma-focused therapies for refugee children with PTSD are highly needed.<b>Objective:</b> A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to provide an overview of, and to analyse, intervention studies using PTSD measures in young refugees, assessing treatment effectiveness and addressing efforts to mitigate barriers to mental health care.<b>Method:</b> Eleven databases were searched for studies evaluating trauma-focused treatments (TFT) for refugee children (0-18). Meta-analyses were conducted for all included studies grouped together; and second, per intervention type, using posttreatment measures and follow-up measures. Pooled between-group effect sizes (ESs) and pre-post ESs, using a random-effects model were calculated.<b>Results:</b> A total of 47 studies was retrieved, with 32 included in the meta-analyses. The narrative review highlighted positive outcomes in reducing posttraumatic stress symptoms for CBT-based interventions, EMDR therapy, KIDNET, and other treatments such as art therapy. Meta-analyses revealed medium pooled pre-post ESs for CBT-based interventions (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.55) and large for EMDR therapy (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.63). RCT and CT studies using follow-up measures showed promising outcomes for KIDNET (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;-.49). High heterogeneity of the included studies limited interpretation of several other combined effects. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the generally low quality of the included studies. All studies addressed efforts to minimize treatment barriers.<b>Conclusion:</b> More high-quality studies are urgently needed to inform treatment recommendations. Evidence-based therapies, such as CBT-based interventions, EMDR therapy, and KIDNET, demonstrate promising findings but need further replication. Strategies to overcome barriers to treatment may be necessary to reach this population. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated intervention studies targeting PTSD in young refugees, analysing treatment effectiveness and barriers to mental health care.Meta-analyses revealed medium to large pre&#x2013;post effect sizes for CBT-based interventions and EMDR therapy. Medium between-group effect sizes where shown for KIDNET when using follow-up measures, suggesting effectiveness over time. All studies addressed efforts to minimize treatment barriers.Due to high heterogeneity and generally low study quality, additional high-quality research is needed to inform treatment recommendations. Implementing strategies to overcome treatment barriers may be essential for effectively reaching this population. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La prevalencia del trastorno de estr&#xe9;s postraum&#xe1;tico (TEPT) en refugiados es m&#xe1;s alta en comparaci&#xf3;n con la poblaci&#xf3;n general, y las barreras para acceder a la atenci&#xf3;n de salud mental son frecuentemente experimentadas. Con un n&#xfa;mero alarmante de personas que buscan refugio alrededor del mundo, y cuando 40% son menores de 18 a&#xf1;os o menos, se necesitan urgentemente terapias eficaces centradas en el trauma para los ni&#xf1;os refugiados con TEPT. <b>Objetivo:</b> Una revisi&#xf3;n sistem&#xe1;tica y meta-an&#xe1;lisis fueron llevados a cabo para proporcionar una mirada general de, y para analizar, los estudios de intervenci&#xf3;n usando las medidas de TEPT en refugiados j&#xf3;venes, evaluando la efectividad del tratamiento y abordando los esfuerzos por mitigar las barreras de atenci&#xf3;n de salud mental. <b>M&#xe9;todo:</b> Se buscaron estudios evaluando los tratamientos centrados en el trauma (TFT en su sigla en ingl&#xe9;s) para ni&#xf1;os refugiados (0&#x2013;18) en once bases de datos. Los meta-an&#xe1;lisis se llevaron a cabo para todos los estudios incluidos agrupados; y luego, por tipo de intervenci&#xf3;n, usando medidas al postratamiento y de seguimiento. Se calcularon los tama&#xf1;os del efecto entre los grupos (ESs en su sigla en ingl&#xe9;s) y ESs antes y despu&#xe9;s, usando un modelo de efectos aleatorios que fueron calculados. <b>Resultados:</b> Un total de 47 estudios fueron extra&#xed;dos, con 32 siendo incluidos en el meta-an&#xe1;lisis. La revisi&#xf3;n narrativa subray&#xf3; los resultados positivos en reducir los s&#xed;ntomas de estr&#xe9;s postraum&#xe1;tico para las intervenciones basadas en TCC, terapia EMDR, KIDNET, y otros tratamientos como arte-terapia. Los meta-an&#xe1;lisis revelaron ESs agrupados antes y despu&#xe9;s medianos para las intervenciones basadas en TCC (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;.55) y grandes para la terapia EMDR (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;1.63). Estudios de RCT y CT que utilizaron medidas de seguimiento mostraron resultados prometedores para KIDNET (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;.49). La alta heterogeneidad de los estudios incluidos limit&#xf3; la interpretaci&#xf3;n de varios otros efectos combinados. Los resultados deber&#xed;an ser interpretados con precauci&#xf3;n debido a la baja calidad general de los estudios incluidos. Todos los estudios abordaron esfuerzos para minimizar las barreras al tratamiento. <b>Conclusi&#xf3;n:</b> Se necesitan urgentemente estudios de m&#xe1;s alta calidad para recomendaciones de tratamiento definitivas. Las terapias basadas en la evidencia, tales como intervenciones basadas en TCC, terapia EMDR, y KIDNET, demostraron hallazgos prometedores, pero requieren mayor replicaci&#xf3;n. Es posible que se requieran estrategias para superar las barreras al tratamiento.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis impacts patients' mental and physical health, prompting interest in psychosocial interventions. To compare and rank different psychosocial interventions for psoriasis and their effects on well-being and mental health. A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO (<i>via</i> the OVID) from their inception to 6 February 2024. Trials investing in psychosocial therapy in psoriasis patients were included using A random-effects network meta-analysis (NMW) within a Bayesian framework focusing on dermatology life quality index (DLQI), depression, and anxiety, along with adherence to treatment. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Handbook. Thirteen studies with 6 treatments and 1233 patients were included. The quality of the included studies was low. For DLQI, 9 studies were eligible, mindfulness&#xa0;+&#xa0;treatment as usual (TAU) was better than TAU (MD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-7.21, 95%CI [-14.89, 0.54]). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xa0;+&#xa0;TAU were more effective in improving HADS-anxiety (MD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.17, 95%CI [-3.86, -0.49]) and HADS-depression (MD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.58, 95%CI [-3.65, 0.68]). Regarding adherence, CBT&#xa0;+&#xa0;TAU (MD = 0.84, 95%CI [-0.62, 2.27]) ranked first, followed by motivational interviewing&#xa0;+&#xa0;TAU. We confirmed the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on patients' well-being and mental health and recommended several interventions for clinical practice. However, the results should be cautiously interpreted, due to lacking high-quality and more replication studies.",

The vagus nerve plays a pivotal role in the gut-brain axis, facilitating bidirectional communication between these systems. Recent meta-analyses suggest potential antidepressant effects of probiotics, although their mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of a multi-species probiotic (OMNi-BiOTiC&#xae; STRESS Repair) on vagus nerve function in 43 MD patients and 43&#xa0;healthy controls (HC). Participants received either probiotics or placebo twice daily. Serum and stool samples were collected at baseline, 7&#x2009;days, 28&#x2009;days, and 3&#x2009;months. Vagus nerve (VN) function was evaluated using 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) for heart rate variability (HRV), alongside stool microbiome analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing. After 3&#x2009;months, MD patients receiving probiotics demonstrated significantly improved morning VN function compared to HC. MD participants who were in the probiotic group showed a significant increase in <i>Christensellales</i>, particularly <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> along with improved sleep parameters (use of sleep medication, sleep latency) as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSI). This study highlights potential physiological benefits of probiotics in MD, potentially mediated through VN stimulation. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to novel therapeutic approaches for MD management.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal opioid use disorder (OUD) remains a public health epidemic. Stress, anxiety and depression are disproportionately high among this population and are associated with poor recovery outcomes. Mindfulness interventions show promise for supporting recovery for women. This paper reports results of a pilot study to evaluate initial efficacy and acceptability of digitally delivered mindfulness meditation videos to reduce stress and promote mindfulness among women in recovery. Women with lived experience of OUD were recruited from three outpatient programs that provided care to pregnant and parenting women with a history of opioid use in rural northern New England (2 maternity care settings that offered buprenorphine as part of their service menu and 1 academic substance use treatment setting). In a pre-post study design, participants were randomly assigned to receive four of 16 short meditation videos, each delivered by email in a survey link over a 2-week period (2 per week) Videos were co-designed in earlier work with representative end-users, guided by evidence-based mindfulness interventions. Assessment included the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale. Participants rated each video on usefulness, enjoyability, ability to lower anxiety, and intention to use in the future. Participants also provided open-ended feedback about the videos. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and generalized linear modeling. A total of 20 women, ages 24-36&#x2009;years, completed the pilot study. Most participants (95%) were white and non-Hispanic, reflecting the rural region. Marginal mean perceived stress scores decreased significantly from 21.49 to 19.85 [<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43] and mean mindfulness scores increased significantly from 3.47 to 3.76 [<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45]. Overall, the meditation videos were rated as highly acceptable and useful and a majority (80%) indicated intention to use the meditations in the future. Digitally delivered meditation videos were highly acceptable and useful to participants and the low dose intervention reduced stress and improved mindfulness. Findings inform directions for future research with larger samples to evaluate the effectiveness of this accessible digital intervention to support women in recovery and strategies for broadly implementing the intervention. A low dose of a digitally delivered meditation video intervention significantly reduced perceived stress and improved mindfulness in women with opioid use disorder.The meditation videos were highly acceptable and useful to participants and the digital implementation was demonstrated feasible.Participant feedback informed further refinements of meditation videos to promote engagement.The pilot study seeds a strong foundation from which to conduct larger, fully powered randomized controlled studies to evaluate effectiveness and implementation of a digital delivered meditation intervention to support recovery for women with opioid use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a promising technology for delivering cognitive training to persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), as it can provide situations resembling everyday activities. Studies have demonstrated that persons with TBI manage utilizing VR in clinical settings; however, no studies have investigated VR use in home settings. The aim of this study was to explore how persons with TBI experience utilizing VR for rehabilitation at home and how they experience VR as cognitive training. Individual qualitative interviews were conducted with ten persons with TBI, aged 18-65. Participants had experience using VR, as they were recruited from the intervention group in a randomized controlled trial investigating VR in cognitive training. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants highlighted the importance of creating new routines when fitting VR into everyday life. They addressed how being in a virtual world contributes to their motivation for cognitive training. Three themes were developed: 'Fitting VR-training into everyday life', 'Navigating through change' and 'Being in two worlds at the same time'. This study shows that participants experienced VR as motivating, engaging, and easy to use, regardless of prior experiences with VR. The participants demonstrated how they included VR in everyday life by creating new routines when they performed cognitive training. Therewere few reports of adverse events. However, some experienced that VR had a negative impact on their energy level. Participants described the importance of therapeutic involvement for individual tailoring of the intervention.",

    "title": "Acute effects of isolated and combined dietary nitrate and caffeine ingestion on ergometer-based 1000 m time trial performance in highly trained kayakers.",
    "abstract": "Dietary nitrate (BR) and caffeine (CAF) ingestion have been shown to increase sports performance. However, the isolated and combined effects of BR and CAF ingestion on time trial (TT) performance as well as the accompanying physiological and perceptual responses have never been investigated in highly trained kayak athletes. Therefore, the present study examined the impact of an isolated and combined supplementation with BR (140&#x2009;ml beetroot concentrate, ~12.5&#x2009;mmol nitrate) and CAF (3&#x2009;mg/kg bodyweight) on 1000&#x2009;m ergometer TT performance as well as the accompanying physiological (i.e. cardiorespiratory function, muscle oxygenation, muscle activity) and perceptual responses (i.e. fatigue, effort, and exercise-induced pain perception) in male highly trained kayakers. It was hypothesized that the isolated ingestion of BR and CAF would both improve ergometer-based 1000&#x2009;m TT performance and induce supplement-specific physiological and perceptual responses. Considering the primary effects of BR on muscle function and of CAF on the central nervous system, it was further assumed that the combined ingestion will result in an additional performance increase and supplement-specific physiological and perceptual responses. Using a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover design, 12 male highly trained kayak athletes from local clubs were investigated. They completed four measurement sessions resulting in four randomized conditions: (i) BR+CAF; (ii) BR+CAF placebo (BR+PLA); (iii) CAF+BR placebo (CAF+PLA); and (iv) BR placebo + CAF placebo (PLA+PLA). An air-braked instrumented kayak-ergometer was used to record 1000&#x2009;m TT performance, power output, and stroke frequency. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>), maximum VO<sub>2</sub> (VO<sub>2max</sub>), respiratory equivalent of O<sub>2</sub> (VE/VO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon dioxide (VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>) were measured continuously. Furthermore, oxygenation of the deltoid muscle was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (mNIRS) and muscle activity of nine unilateral muscles with surface electromyography (i.e. deltoideus, serratus anterior, triceps brachii caput lateralis, trapezius, infraspinatus, latissimus dorsi, obliquus externus, flexor carpi radialis, and vastus lateralis muscle) during the 1000&#x2009;m TT. After the TT, fatigue, effort, and exercise-induced pain perception were queried. One- and two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures were conducted to determine differences between conditions for the entire 1000&#x2009;m TT and predefined sections (0-50&#x2009;m, 50-100&#x2009;m, 100-150&#x2009;m, 150-250&#x2009;m, 250-500&#x2009;m, 500-750&#x2009;m, 750-1000&#x2009;m), respectively (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05). The supplements did not have an ergogenic effect on TT performance compared to the PLA+PLA condition, either in isolation or in combination. The same applied to the majority of physiological parameters and the perceptual responses. Nevertheless, VE/VO<sub>2</sub> was lower during the sections 150-250&#x2009;m (-5.00%; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and 250-500&#x2009;m (-3.49%; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) in the BR+PLA condition, whereby VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> was higher during the section 150-250&#x2009;m (4.19%; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) in the CAF+PLA compared to the PLA+PLA condition, respectively. Data indicate that the isolated and combined ingestion of BR and CAF had no effect on 1000&#x2009;m TT performance, the majority of physiological responses, and perceptual responses in highly trained kayakers. These findings might be related to the dosage and/or a ceiling effect due to the already efficient vascular, metabolic, and muscle function, including high amounts of endogenous produced nitric oxide, in athletes.",

    "title": "Treating sleep disturbances in refugees and asylum seekers: results from a randomized controlled pilot trial evaluating the STARS group intervention.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in traumatized refugees and often persist despite treatment, and adapted scalable interventions are needed. The group intervention 'Sleep Training adapted for Refugees' (STARS) is a culturally- and context-sensitive approach based on evidence-based treatments for sleep disturbances (e.g. CBT-I, IRT). This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of STARS.<b>Method:</b> A randomized-controlled trial (STARS vs. waitlist) with 47 young male Afghan refugees was conducted in a routine clinical setting (DRKS-ID: DRKS00024419) with pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up assessments. The primary outcome was insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index); secondary outcomes included PTSD, anxiety and depression symptoms, nightmares, coping with nightmares, fear of sleep, selected sleep diary measures, and quality of life. The data were analysed using mixed models.<b>Results:</b> Adherence to STARS was high (dropout&#x2009;=&#x2009;17.4%, average attended sessions&#x2009;=&#x2009;77%) as was client satisfaction (<i>M</i><sub>CSQ-4</sub><i>&#x2009;</i>=&#x2009;12.74, <i>SD</i><sub>CSQ-4</sub><i>&#x2009;</i>=&#x2009;2.08). A medium to large significant effect of time was observed for insomnia severity (<i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.96) and most secondary measures (except nightmares and fear of sleep). However, there was no significant interaction with condition at post-treatment for the primary outcome (<i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.29) and most secondary outcomes; the only exceptions were increased coping with nightmares, decreased daytime sleep, and time in bed.<b>Conclusions:</b> STARS appears feasible for treating sleep disturbances in traumatized refugees in a routine clinical setting, showing moderate to large within-group effects. However, it was not superior to the waitlist, likely due to unexpected improvements in the waitlist group. Adjustments to STARS may enhance its efficacy. Further research is needed to determine how STARS can be a scalable add-on treatment for sleep disturbances in traumatized refugees and asylum seekers.<b>Trial registration:</b> German Clinical Trials Register identifier: DRKS00024419.. A context- and culture-sensitive group sleep intervention for traumatized refugees and asylum-seekers was feasible in a routine clinical setting.Client satisfaction and acceptance were high, indicating successful adaptation of evidence-based sleep interventions.Insomnia severity and most secondary outcomes were significantly reduced post-treatment and at follow-up, yet no superiority to waitlist was found.Further research is needed to refine STARS and explore scalable, effective treatments for sleep disturbances in this population. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Las alteraciones del sue&#xf1;o son altamente prevalentes en los refugiados traumatizados y a menudo persisten a pesar del tratamiento, por lo que se necesitan intervenciones adaptadas y escalables.

El resultado primario fue la gravedad del insomnio (&#xcd;ndice de Severidad del Insomnio); los resultados secundarios incluyeron s&#xed;ntomas de TEPT, ansiedad y depresi&#xf3;n, pesadillas, afrontamiento de las pesadillas, miedo a dormir, medidas seleccionadas del diario de sue&#xf1;o y calidad de vida. Los datos fueron analizados utilizando modelos mixtos. <b>Resultados:</b> La adherencia a STARS fue alta (deserci&#xf3;n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17.4%, sesiones asistidas promedio&#x2009;=&#x2009;77%) al igual que la satisfacci&#xf3;n de los clientes (MCSQ-4&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.74, SDCSQ-4&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.08). Se observ&#xf3; un efecto significativo de mediano a grande del tiempo para la gravedad del insomnio (<i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.96) y la mayor&#xed;a de las medidas secundarias (excepto pesadillas y miedo a dormir). Sin embargo, no hubo interacci&#xf3;n significativa con la condici&#xf3;n despu&#xe9;s del tratamiento para el resultado primario (<i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.29) ni para la mayor&#xed;a de los resultados secundarios; las &#xfa;nicas excepciones fueron un mayor afrontamiento de las pesadillas, disminuci&#xf3;n del sue&#xf1;o diurno y tiempo en la cama. <b>Conclusiones:</b> STARS parece ser viable para tratar las alteraciones del sue&#xf1;o en refugiados traumatizados en un entorno cl&#xed;nico rutinario, mostrando efectos moderados a grandes dentro del grupo. Sin embargo, no fue superior a la lista de espera, probablemente debido a mejoras inesperadas en el grupo de lista de espera. Es posible que ajustes en STARS mejoren su eficacia. Se necesita m&#xe1;s investigaci&#xf3;n para determinar c&#xf3;mo STARS puede ser un tratamiento complementario escalable para las alteraciones del sue&#xf1;o en refugiados traumatizados y solicitantes de asilo.",

    "title": "Therapists perspectives on the Early Intervention after Rape study: a qualitative process evaluation of a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "<b>ABSTRACT</b><b>Background</b>: Early interventions using trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy have the potential to alleviate post-traumatic stress symptoms in individuals who have experienced recent sexual assault. Specialized Sexual Assault Centers (SACs) in Norway offers psychosocial support, however, this support varies across SACs and its efficacy has not been researched. The Early Intervention after Rape (EIR) study is a multisite randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of training SAC nurses and social workers to deliver a modified version of prolonged exposure therapy shortly after rape.<b>Objective</b>: This article aims to present a qualitative process evaluation of the implementation of the EIR study across three SACs in Norway, from the perspective of nurses and social workers.<b>Method</b>: We conducted semi-structured interviews with fifteen nurses and social workers, ten of whom received training in prolonged exposure therapy (mPE). We used Thematic Analysis to identify themes and subthemes.<b>Results</b>: Thematic analysis yielded four significant themes for process evaluation: (1) The quality of the new intervention modified prolonged exposure was considered satisfactory through training and supervision and delivered with good adherence to the manual, although some therapists perceived the manual as too rigid; (2) Adoption dynamics within the SACs are complex and include both enthusiasm for clinical research as well as resistance to change; (3) Narrow inclusion criteria and burden with participation for patients may limit reach and representativeness of the RCT; (4) Unintended consequences were identified, such as delayed start, conflicting advices and cross-contamination, underscoring the ongoing necessity for process evaluation alongside RCTs.<b>Conclusion</b>: This qualitative process evaluation offers insight into real-world clinical challenges with implementing a new intervention and conducting a multisite RCT within SACs in Norway. This study may inform opportunities to advance evidence-based practices for rape survivors seeking help.<b>Trial registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05489133.. Process evaluations provide insight into the challenges and opportunities of conducting randomized controlled trials, and should be integrated in RCTs.Training and supervision are essential for ensuring high-quality implementation.Providing SAC therapists with effective treatment tools could improve services for rape survivors. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Las intervenciones tempranas usando terapia cognitivo-conductual centrada en el trauma tiene el potencial de aliviar los s&#xed;ntomas de estr&#xe9;s postraum&#xe1;ticos de quienes han experimentado una agresi&#xf3;n sexual reciente. Los Centros de Agresi&#xf3;n Sexual Especializados (SACs en su sigla en ingl&#xe9;s) en Noruega ofrecen apoyo psicosocial, sin embargo, este apoyo var&#xed;a a lo largo de los SACs y su eficacia no ha sido investigada. El estudio de Intervenci&#xf3;n Temprana luego de una Violaci&#xf3;n (EIR en su sigla en ingl&#xe9;s) es un ensayo controlado aleatorizado multic&#xe9;ntrico dise&#xf1;ado para evaluar la eficacia y efectividad del entrenamiento de las enfermeras y trabajadores sociales del SAC para implementar una versi&#xf3;n modificada de la terapia de exposici&#xf3;n prolongada poco despu&#xe9;s de la violaci&#xf3;n. <b>Objetivo:</b> Este articulo busca presentar una evaluaci&#xf3;n del proceso de la implementaci&#xf3;n del estudio EIR a trav&#xe9;s de tres SACs en Noruega, desde la perspectiva de las enfermeras y trabajadores sociales. <b>M&#xe9;todo:</b> Se llevaron a cabo entrevistas semi-estructuradas con quince enfermeras y trabajadores sociales, diez de los cuales recibieron entrenamiento en terapia de exposici&#xf3;n prolongada (mPE). Usamos an&#xe1;lisis tem&#xe1;tico para identificar los temas y subtemas. <b>Resultados:</b> El an&#xe1;lisis tem&#xe1;tico produjo cuatro temas significativos para la evaluaci&#xf3;n de procesos: (1) La calidad de la nueva intervenci&#xf3;n modificada de exposici&#xf3;n prolongada se consider&#xf3; satisfactoria a trav&#xe9;s del entrenamiento y la supervisi&#xf3;n e implementada con buena adherencia al manual, aunque algunos terapeutas percibieron el manual como muy r&#xed;gido; (2) Las din&#xe1;micas de adopci&#xf3;n dentro de los SACs son complejas e incluyen tanto entusiasmo por la investigaci&#xf3;n cl&#xed;nica como tambi&#xe9;n resistencia al cambio; (3) Los criterios de inclusi&#xf3;n limitados y la carga de la participaci&#xf3;n para los pacientes podr&#xed;a limitar el alcance y la representatividad del ECA; (4) Se identificaron consecuencias no deseadas, tales como demoras en el inicio, consejos contradictorios y contaminaci&#xf3;n cruzada, lo que subraya la necesidad continua de la evaluaci&#xf3;n de los procesos junto con los ECAs. <b>Conclusi&#xf3;n:</b> Esta evaluaci&#xf3;n del proceso ofrece perspectivas en los desaf&#xed;os cl&#xed;nicos del mundo real con la implementaci&#xf3;n de una nueva intervenci&#xf3;n y llevar a cabo un ECA multic&#xe9;ntrico en los SACs en Noruega.

    "abstract": "Stress from daily psychosocial challenges is a significant health concern with limited pharmacological treatment options. Psychosocial stress triggers distinct responses in the autonomic and central nervous systems, measurable via heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalogram (EEG). This post hoc analysis of clinical trial data explores the impact of the anti-stress medication Neurexan (Nx4) on HRV and EEG signals, and their correlation in a resting state following acute psychosocial stress induction. Data from the NEURIM trial (NCT02602275), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study, were utilized. Participants received Nx4 before exposure to ScanSTRESS, a psychosocial stress paradigm. EEG and photoplethysmogram data were collected at rest before and after stress exposure. Stress responsivity under both placebo and Nx4 conditions was evaluated through HRV and EEG signals. Psychosocial stress altered HRV parameters (increased LF/HF ratio, elevated Baevsky's Stress Index, reduced RMSSD) and EEG activity (decreased aperiodic offset, increased alpha power). Nx4 significantly mitigated stress-induced changes in LF/HF ratio, Baevsky's Stress Index, and aperiodic offset. A significant correlation was observed between Nx4 effects on HRV and EEG activity. Nx4 attenuates peripheral and central physiological stress responses, suggesting a comprehensive approach to mitigating stress responses in daily life.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of chair-based exercises and cognitive training with synchronous telerehabilitation in healthy older adults and to compare chair-based exercises with a brochure. The study included 27 healthy older adults aged 65 and over (intervention group n: 16, control group n: 11). The intervention group received chair-based exercises and cognitive training as synchronous telerehabilitation, while the control group received chair-based exercises as a brochure. Chair-based exercises were performed 2&#x2009;days a week and cognitive training 1&#x2009;day a week for 8&#x2009;weeks. Hodkinson Mental Test, Mini-Mental State Examination, chair-stand test, timed up and go test, dual task timed up and go test, Berg Balance Scale, dominant side single leg stand test, Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, Successful Aging Scale and older people's quality of life-brief (OPQOL-Brief) were assessed. All evaluations were made pre and post treatment. In the intervention group, there was a significant difference in Hodkinson Mental Test (p: 0.017), Mini-Mental State Examination (p: 0.006), Berg Balance Scale (p: 0.007) and chair-stand test (p: 0.026). In the control group, there was a significant difference in Hodkinson Mental Test (p: 0.020), timed up and go test (p: 0.025), dual-task timed up and go test (p: 0.012) and Successful Aging Scale (p: 0.041). The groups had no superiority over each other in any parameter (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Chair-based exercises can increase cognitive functions and lower extremity functions in healthy older adults in both synchronous online telerehabilitation and brochure methods. However, the groups were not superior to each other. Cognitive training applied once a week was insufficient to create an effect in 8&#x2009;weeks. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06302101.",

    "title": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Body Dissatisfaction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Body dissatisfaction (BD) is increasing internationally and is associated with a range of physical and psychological negative outcomes, including eating disorders (ED). As a result, there is a great need to identify treatments that reduce BD to intervene and prevent these outcomes. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has been employed for body image and weight concerns. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of ACT in reducing BD. To evaluate the efficacy of ACT on measures of BD in those with or without a diagnosable ED. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including 12 studies that utilized individual, group, or online self-help ACT interventions targeting BD (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;825; analyzed at the end of interventions N&#x2009;=&#x2009;741). ACT was efficacious in decreasing BD compared to control groups with a significant medium effect size in the full sample (k&#x2009;=&#x2009;12, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.556, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;[0.35, 0.77], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;45.61). The strongest effect sizes were produced by subgroups of participants who were at high risk for EDs (k&#x2009;=&#x2009;6, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.631, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and those who received ACT via online self-help forums (k&#x2009;=&#x2009;3, g&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.563, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.005). A majority of studies (75%) had low to medium risk of bias. The mean dropout rate across ACT interventions was 23.51%. These results demonstrate that ACT is efficacious in BD reduction, particularly in those with high BD, at risk for developing EDs, and in the form of online self-help. ACT, therefore, shows potential as a prevention program, in addition to augmenting existing multidisciplinary treatments for ED patients. Due to limitations of this meta-analysis, further research should investigate a greater volume of large-scale trials from diverse populations across the globe.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy of respiratory training in elderly patients with dysphagia through a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research data and outcomes. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang were searched for studies from their inception to 2024. Included studies were randomised controlled trials involving elderly patients (aged &#x2265;&#x2009;65&#x2009;years) with diagnosed dysphagia who underwent respiratory training, such as expiratory muscle strength training or inspiratory muscle training, with a follow-up period of at least 6 months. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3. Ten RCTs were included, with five rated as high quality (Grade A), four as moderate quality (Grade B) and one as low quality (Grade C). The meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in the respiratory training group compared with the control group: forced expiratory volume in the first second (relative risk&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.05, 0.08], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.000), peak expiratory flow (mean difference [MD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;-3.99, 95% CI [-4.88, -3.11], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.000) and Penetration-Aspiration Scale score (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.16, 95% CI [-2.35, -1.98], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.000). Respiratory training substantially improves respiratory and swallowing function in elderly patients with dysphagia and reduces the risk of aspiration, demonstrating greater efficacy than conventional care. These findings suggest a broad potential for the application of respiratory training in dysphagia rehabilitation for elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise offers many health benefits, with substantial evidence supporting its positive impact on affective symptoms. An intriguing yet underexplored mechanism associated with this effect is the enhancement of interoception-the ability to perceive internal bodily sensations. We investigated the effects of long-term aerobic exercise on interoceptive accuracy (IAcc), interoceptive confidence (ICon) and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Physically inactive young adult participants were randomly assigned to either an Experimental (n = 32) or a passive Control group (n = 30). The Experimental group completed a 12-week cycling ergometer program, with the first 6 weeks consisting of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) followed by 6 weeks of moderate to high-intensity interval training (MIIT). IAcc and ICon was assessed through a heartbeat counting task, while symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of intervention. The results showed a significant improvement in IAcc, ICon and affective symptoms in the Experimental group after 6 weeks of MICT compared to baseline. However, the transition to MIIT did not produce further gains. No beneficial changes in IAcc, ICon or affective symptoms were observed in the passive Control group throughout the intervention. The study highlights exercise's potential to improve interoception in physically inactive young adults and to enhance emotional well-being by improving affective symptoms. Given the increasing physical inactivity among healthy individuals, our findings may contribute to preventing the adverse consequences of such a lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Gay community stress has been linked to social anxiety among sexual minority men; however, the moderating role of identity-related processes (e.g., sexual identity centrality) has yet to be examined in this association. The present study investigated the association between gay community stress and two measures of social anxiety (i.e., self-reported social anxiety symptoms and interviewer-based diagnostic assessment of social anxiety disorder), as well as the moderating role of sexual identity centrality. Data come from the baseline assessment of a randomized controlled trial testing an LGBTQ-affirmative cognitive behavioral therapy intervention with 251 sexual minority men between the ages of 18-35. Results showed that gay community stress was significantly associated with social anxiety symptoms and social anxiety disorder diagnosis. Sexual identity centrality moderated these associations, such that the link between gay community stress and both social anxiety assessments was stronger among participants with higher levels of sexual identity centrality. These significant findings remained even after accounting for sexual orientation-based discrimination and general life stress. Future research can investigate how the interaction between gay community stress, sexual identity centrality, and social anxiety develops over time to inform interventions aimed at mitigating social distress among sexual minority men.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to to assess the effect of pre-exercise caffeine intake (CAF) on fatigue and recovery in basketball. Using a randomized crossover design, 14 amateur male players completed two basketball-specific training sessions (in-season phase, February-March 2024), preceded by CAF (3 mg/kg body weight) or placebo ingestion (CON). Countermovement jump height, 10- and 20-m sprint times, heart rate variability (Ln-rMSSD), static and dynamic muscle soreness, and perceived fatigue were recorded at pre-training, post-training and 24 h post-training to evaluate the effectiveness of caffeine supplementation. The results showed no significant differences between CAF and CON at corresponding time points for any variable (P &gt; 0.05). Regarding the effect of time, the main findings indicate that countermovement jump (average percentage change [%&#x2206;] = -7% to -10%) and Ln-rMSSD (%&#x2206; = -33% to -54%) decreased at post-training compared with all other time points (P &lt; 0.001, effect size = 1.41-1.98), while 10-m sprint times deteriorated from pre-to-post-training (P = 0.029, effect size = 0.69, %&#x2206; = -2%). Similarly, muscle soreness (%&#x2206; = +171%) and perceived fatigue (%&#x2206; = +156%) increased from pre-to-post-training in both interventions (P &#x2264; 0.006, r = 0.57-0.61), with static soreness in CON (%&#x2206; = +127%) and dynamic soreness in CAF (%&#x2206; = +139%) remaining higher than pre-training levels up to 24 h post-training (P &#x2264; 0.010, r = 0.53-0.58). These findings suggest that pre-exercise caffeine intake did not significantly affect markers of fatigue in amateur basketball players, either acutely or 24 h post-training.",

    "abstract": "ADHD is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition worldwide. While therapeutic approaches continue to evolve, clinical considerations for adult patients remain underexplored. Recent approaches such as neurofeedback, tDCS, or rTMS, have emerged, requiring clarification of therapeutic protocols need to assess their relevance and efficacy. a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid and ScienceDirect databases was performed. A total of 1747 articles were extracted and inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to screen satisfactorily. Eighteen articles were selected for detailed analysis. tDCS and rTMS showed the most robust methodological designs among the studies analyzed. TDCS seems to be effective with anode at F3 and cathode at F4 at 2&#xa0;mA. RTMS seems to be effective on unilateral DLPFC at high frequency, with optimal results using deep coil. Medication appeared to have little to no effect in the studies reviewed. However, meta-analysis did not reach significance for any of the techniques studied. Future research should focus on enlarging the sample sizes for tDCS and TMS, and investigating the effect of comorbidities. Neurofeedback lacks significant study quality. It could still be a viable option, particularly for population reluctant to undergo neuromodulation technics. Combination of tDCS and other therapies may hold significant therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a new treatment class for major depressive disorder (MDD). This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a novel DTx, CT-152 (Rejoyn&#x2122;), for MDD adjunctive to antidepressant medication monotherapy. Adults aged 22-64&#xa0;years with MDD having an inadequate response to current antidepressant medication monotherapy were enrolled in a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, remote trial with a 6-week intervention and 4-week extension. Delivered via smartphone apps, the CT-152 group received a cognitive-emotional and behavioral therapeutic intervention; the control group received a sham app with a working memory task. Both groups received supportive text messages and continued current antidepressant medication. The primary outcome was Montgomery-&#xc5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score change from baseline to week 6. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed. Overall, 386 participants were randomly assigned (CT-152, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;194; sham, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;192). In the primary efficacy analysis of participants with &#x2265; 1 treatment session and&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;1 MADRS assessment post-baseline (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;354), MADRS score changed -9.03 in the CT-152 group and&#xa0;-&#xa0;7.25 in the sham (difference,&#xa0;-&#xa0;1.78; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0568). These results were consistent with data from additional patient and clinician scales. In a supportive analysis of the intent-to-treat sample (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;386), the between-group difference in 6-week MADRS change from baseline was -2.12 (P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0211), favoring CT-152. No TEAEs or discontinuations were considered related to CT-152, and no deaths occurred. CT-152 resulted in depression symptom improvement and a favorable safety profile. Based on these data, CT-152 became the first FDA-authorized prescription DTx for the adjunctive treatment of MDD.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports a pilot trial of culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) for Canadian South Asians. The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of online CaCBT to treat anxiety and depression in Canadian South Asian individuals. The secondary objective was to measure changes in depression, anxiety, and disability. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 sites in Canada (Greater Toronto Area, Ottawa, and Vancouver). One hundred forty-six participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: Ca-CBT (experimental group) or standard cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (control group) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome, feasibility, was measured through engagement, recruitment, and participant retention. Acceptability was measured through the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale. Working Alliance Inventory was used to measure therapeutic engagement. Secondary outcomes included depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-HADS), somatic symptoms (Bradford Somatic Inventory-BSI), and disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS). Assessments were carried out at baseline, at the end of therapy (12 weeks from baseline), and at follow-up (36 weeks from baseline).

Eight (10.7%) participants from the intervention group and 9 (12.0%) from the control group dropped out of therapy (&lt;5 sessions). Participants in the intervention group reported higher levels of satisfaction (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and therapeutic engagement (<i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) compared with the control group. Participants in both groups benefited from CBT. This is the first report of online CaCBT for depression and anxiety for Canadian South Asians. The intervention is acceptable and feasible. Culturally adapted CBT is as effective as standard CBT in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Le pr&#xe9;sent article fait le rapport d&#x2019;un essai pilote de TCC adapt&#xe9;e &#xe0; la culture (TCCaC) pour les Canadiens d&#x2019;origine sud-asiatique. Le principal objectif de cette &#xe9;tude &#xe9;tait d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuer la faisabilit&#xe9; et l&#x2019;acceptabilit&#xe9; de la TCCaC en ligne pour traiter l&#x2019;anxi&#xe9;t&#xe9; et la d&#xe9;pression chez les Canadiens d&#x2019;origine sud-asiatique. L&#x2019;objectif secondaire &#xe9;tait de mesurer l&#x2019;&#xe9;volution de la d&#xe9;pression, de l&#x2019;anxi&#xe9;t&#xe9; et de l&#x2019;invalidit&#xe9;. Un projet de recherche &#xe0; r&#xe9;partition al&#xe9;atoire, men&#xe9; &#xe0; l&#x2019;insu de l&#x2019;&#xe9;valuateur, a &#xe9;t&#xe9; men&#xe9; &#xe0; trois endroits au Canada (r&#xe9;gion du Grand Toronto, Ottawa et Vancouver). 146 participants ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; r&#xe9;partis au hasard, en proportions &#xe9;gales, dans l&#x2019;un des deux groupes suivants : TCCaC (groupe exp&#xe9;rimental) ou TCC standard (groupe t&#xe9;moin). Le r&#xe9;sultat principal, la faisabilit&#xe9;, a &#xe9;t&#xe9; mesur&#xe9; par l&#x2019;engagement, le recrutement et la r&#xe9;tention des participants. L&#x2019;acceptabilit&#xe9; a &#xe9;t&#xe9; mesur&#xe9;e au moyen de l&#x2019;&#xe9;chelle Verona Service Satisfaction Scale. L&#x2019;&#xe9;chelle Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) a &#xe9;t&#xe9; utilis&#xe9;e pour mesurer l&#x2019;engagement th&#xe9;rapeutique. Les r&#xe9;sultats secondaires comprenaient la d&#xe9;pression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale &#x2013; HAD), les sympt&#xf4;mes somatiques (Bradford Somatic Inventory &#x2013; BSI) et l&#x2019;incapacit&#xe9; (Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 de l&#x2019;OMS &#x2013; WHODAS). Les &#xe9;valuations ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; effectu&#xe9;es au niveau initial, &#xe0; la fin du traitement (12 semaines apr&#xe8;s la valeur initiale) et au moment du suivi (36 semaines apr&#xe8;s la valeur initiale). Nous avons &#xe9;t&#xe9; en mesure de recruter des participants dans les d&#xe9;lais impartis, avec d&#x2019;excellents taux de r&#xe9;tention dans les deux groupes. La plupart des participants du groupe d&#x2019;intervention (56, soit 74,7%) ont assist&#xe9; &#xe0;&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;8 s&#xe9;ances et 11 (14,7%) &#xe0; 5, 6 ou 7 s&#xe9;ances. 8 participants (10,7%) du groupe d&#x2019;intervention et 9 (12,0%) du groupe de contr&#xf4;le ont abandonn&#xe9; le traitement (&lt; 5 s&#xe9;ances). Les participants du groupe d&#x2019;intervention ont d&#xe9;clar&#xe9; des niveaux plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9;s de satisfaction (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0,001) et d&#x2019;engagement th&#xe9;rapeutique (<i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0,001) comparativement au groupe t&#xe9;moin. La TCC a &#xe9;t&#xe9; b&#xe9;n&#xe9;fique pour les participants des deux groupes.

Among I-CAT participants only, we also examined the time-varying effect of daily I-CAT skill practice on daily affective well-being. Data are drawn from a randomized controlled treatment trial involving 38 young adults with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Participants completed daily reports of positive (happiness, relaxation) and negative (stress, sadness) affect across 9&#x2009;months of treatment. I-CAT recipients completed daily practice of mindfulness and positive coping skills. I-CAT and TAU did not differentially impact daily affect across treatment. However, daily skill practice was associated with better daily affective outcomes in certain phases of I-CAT. We also found that increased daily practice of positive coping skills was associated with better daily affective outcomes, whereas mindfulness practice was associated with poorer affective outcomes during certain periods of the I-CAT intervention. In general, I-CAT did not improve daily affective outcomes compared with TAU. However, components of I-CAT, specifically the daily practice of positive coping skills, were associated with improved daily emotional well-being in young adults with psychosis. Implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), a 12-session, gold-standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and written exposure therapy (WET), a brief, five-session treatment, have similar treatment efficacy. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of long-term treatment outcomes of WET and CPT using clients' written narratives. Narratives from both treatments were coded with the Change and Growth Experiences Scale coding system to identify predictors of long-term PTSD symptom outcomes. Participants were 113 adults with PTSD randomly assigned to receive WET (<i>n</i> = 60) or CPT (<i>n</i> = 53). In WET, higher average levels of accommodated (balanced, healthy) beliefs predicted lower PTSD symptoms at the 60-week endpoint, as well as a decrease in symptoms over the follow-up symptom slope. In CPT, higher average negative emotions and positive view of self predicted better 60-week PTSD symptom outcomes, as did lower hopelessness, which also predicted a decrease in PTSD symptoms over the follow-up period. Even without direct cognitive change techniques, adaptive processing of traumatic experiences occurred in WET and predicted PTSD long-term symptom improvement. Both emotional engagement and cognitive change might help to sustain treatment gains in CPT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Clinical supervision is considered important in psychotherapy training, but little is known about the efficacy of specific supervision methods. We investigate two such methods (video-based vs. verbal report-based supervision) in a randomized controlled trial. Seventy-three supervisees were trained in common cognitive-behavioral therapy methods (i.e. behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring) by means of written information and a modelling video demonstrating the techniques. Supervisees had to apply the techniques in role plays with standardized patients (presenting depressive patients). Subsequently, supervisees were randomized to supervision, based on the video, or supervision based on the verbal report of the supervisees. Subsequently and after a three-month follow-up period, supervisees had to demonstrate the therapeutic techniques again. Therapist competence, therapeutic alliance, empathy, and anxiety were assessed through various different perspectives (i.e. independent raters, standardized patients, and supervisees' self-evaluation). Both supervision conditions lead to a significant improvement of therapeutic competences, therapeutic alliance, and empathy. No significant differences were found between the two supervision conditions. At three-month follow-up, training effects decreased on all perspectives except standardized patients. A training condition without supervision would be necessary to demonstrate that improvements are specific effects of the supervision conditions. Moreover, further supervision seems necessary to maintain training effects over time.",

The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the selected studies. Of 318 articles, eight studies (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;615), with 8% of participants being females, were included in this review. Four studies were classified as having 'high' quality according to the Cochrane Collaboration tool, while four were categorized as 'moderate' quality. There were variations in treatment protocols and outcome measures, resulting in heterogeneous findings. The effects of compensatory cognitive training on cognitive outcomes showed inconsistency. In conclusion, the evidence for the effects of compensatory cognitive training on cognition in people with TBI is promising. Further trials are needed to investigate the effects of compensatory cognitive training on various cognitive domains in people with TBI.",

    "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is common among university students due to academic pressure and financial uncertainty, among other challenges. Despite the need, the receipt of available psychological services is often low. This study investigates the feasibility of a digital unguided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, Cerina, and examines the likely effects of this intervention in reducing GAD symptoms compared to the waitlist control group. Eligible students (n=158) with mild to moderate GAD symptoms were self-assessed through web-based questionnaires and were randomly allocated to the intervention group (n=79) or to the waitlist control group (n=79) following their informed consent. The intervention group had direct access to Cerina and followed CBT-based interactive sessions for 6 weeks. The waitlist control group participants had access to optional on-campus well-being services, and they were given access to Cerina 6 weeks after their randomization. Participants completed assessments on anxiety, depression, worry, and usability at three time points. Additionally, upon completing the intervention, they were invited to a web-based interview to understand the implementation of the intervention in more depth. On average, 13% (10/79) intervention group participants dropped out, 61% (36/69) completed the core clinical content (2 sessions), and 12% (7/69) completed the desired number of sessions (6 or 7 sessions). Analyses of the completers (2 or more sessions) revealed significant group differences in GAD (mean 8.4, SD 3.7; t<sub>42</sub>=-2.25; P=.03; d=-0.7) and worry symptoms (mean 42.3, SD 10.8; t<sub>42</sub>=-2.50; P=.02; d=-0.8), as well as functional impairment (mean 16.7, SD 2.44; t<sub>42</sub>=-2.12; P=.04; d=-0.6) in favor of the intervention group at posttest with medium to large effect sizes. The intention-to-treat analyses confirmed significant group differences in GAD (mean 8.47, SD 2.7; t<sub>156</sub>=-2.23; P=.03; d=-0.4), and there were marginally nonsignificant group differences in worry symptoms (mean 41.5, SD 8.40; t<sub>156</sub>=-1.94; P=.05; d=-0.3) in favor of the intervention group at posttest with medium effect sizes. These results suggest that the intervention had a meaningful impact on reducing GAD symptoms and a modest impact on reducing worry symptoms among participants. The Cerina app showed promising results in reducing GAD symptoms among students. This result supports findings from other randomized controlled trials showing that digital CBT-based interventions are effective and feasible for a wide range of age groups and populations experiencing GAD symptoms. The low number of participants completing the recommended number of sessions suggests a usability issue. To address this, the intervention could be refined through an iterative design process informed by user feedback, and the long-term impact of specific engagement features in improving usability and retention could be assessed through extended evaluations.

    "title": "Enhanced external counter pulsation as a novel therapy to maintain cardiac output during hemodialysis: a preliminary randomized controlled study.",
    "abstract": "Intradialytic cardiac output (CO) decline normally occurs during hemodialysis (HD) and results in short-term intradialytic hypotension to longer-term increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic HD patients. Enhanced external counter pulsation (EECP) is a novel non-invasive device that has been demonstrated to improve coronary blood flow and maintain systemic hemodynamics in patients without kidney dysfunction. This study is the first to explore the efficacy and safety of EECP application during HD on intradialytic changes of CO and other hemodynamic parameters. Stable chronic HD patients without recent cardiovascular events were randomly allocated to the EECP group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7) receiving a single session of 60-min EECP therapy at the early period of 4-h online hemodiafiltration (HDF), and the control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7) obtaining standard 4-h online HDF without EECP. Interval measurements of intradialytic CO by Transonic HD03 device, intradialytic central aortic blood pressure (BP) by AtCor Medical SphygmoCor-XCEL device, and heart rate (HR) in the mid-week HD sessions were conducted. Changes in these parameters were compared with a linear mixed model. CO of the patients in the EECP group was maintained throughout the HDF session compared to a significant CO decline of 2.4 L/min after 4-h HDF in the control group (p-value 0.007). Cardiac index (CI) also changed in the same direction as CO. Central systolic BP, central diastolic BP, central mean arterial pressure, and HR were indifferent between the two groups. In 9 patients continuing the study in the subsequent 36 HDF sessions, there was a trend to prevent the increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I by long-term EECP treatment. No intolerable adverse events related to EECP were reported. EECP application during online HDF could maintain CO, CI, and might reduce the risk of HD-related myocardial ischemia through various proposed mechanisms, including promoting coronary perfusion. However, larger studies on other cardiovascular outcomes are warranted.",

    "abstract": "This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. Additionally, it examines potential moderators of treatment outcomes, including the type of child diagnosis and the dosage of intervention. A comprehensive Literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library up to April 15, 2025. Peer-reviewed RCTs published in English that compared at least one structured CBT intervention to an inactive or active control group were included. Hedges' g was utilized to calculate standardized mean differences (SMDs) in depression scores. Random- or fixed-effects models were employed based on heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to identify moderators. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane ROB2 tool, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. A total of 13 RCTs involving 1,441 parents were included. An initial random-effects model showed a slight, non-significant reduction in depressive symptoms (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.33, 95% CI [-0.72, 0.07]; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;89%). After excluding two outliers, a random-effects analysis indicated a significant effect (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.24, 95% CI [-0.47, 0.00], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;75.9%). Subgroup analyses revealed that CBT was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), in trials using waitlist control groups, involving both parents, and when delivered over a short duration (6-8&#xa0;weeks). Meta-regression demonstrated that child diagnosis type (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.83, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.000) and parental age (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.053) were significant moderators. The optimal therapeutic effect was achieved at a total intervention dose of 4&#xa0;h (SMD &#x2248; -0.5), with parents aged 37.9&#xa0;years demonstrating the most significant improvement, suggesting the necessity for individualized adjustment of the intervention protocol. CBT demonstrated a moderate and significant effect in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs, particularly in the context of NDDs. This effect was most pronounced when interventions were implemented with moderate-to-high intensity, in a short-term format, and involved both parents. Furthermore, tailoring interventions according to the child's diagnosis and the total dosage of the intervention proved essential for optimizing outcomes.",

    "title": "Testing Theory-Enhanced Messaging to Promote COVID-19 Vaccination Among Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low in the United States despite ongoing public health recommendations. This has been linked to many factors, including pandemic fatigue; reduced risk perception; dis- and misinformation; and, more recently, symptoms of depression and anxiety. Novel communication and messaging strategies are one potential approach to promote vaccine uptake. This randomized controlled trial aimed to fill research gaps by testing the effect of 2 communication-based approaches&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;the use of a short attitudinal inoculation message and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) kernel messaging&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;compared to standard public health messaging on vaccine uptake in a cohort of adult US residents. We completed a 3-arm, parallel-group, assessor-blinded stratified randomized trial between April 15, 2024, and May 2, 2024. Individuals were eligible if they were aged &#x2265;18 years and (1) had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine but (2) had not received COVID-19 vaccine doses since September 11, 2023, and (3) had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the previous 3 months. We purposively sampled eligible individuals with and without symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants were randomly allocated to the (1) attitudinal inoculation intervention, (2) CBT kernel intervention, or (3) standard public health messaging intervention. By the 4-week follow-up, COVID-19 vaccination uptake was low overall (17/1403, 1.2%, 95% CI 0.6%-1.8%) and did not significantly differ by study arm&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;1.5% (7/469) in the CBT kernel arm (95% CI 0.4%-2.8%), 0.9% (4/466) in the inoculation arm (95% CI 0%-1.8%), and 1.3% (6/468) in the standard arm (95% CI 0.3%-2.4%). Compared to the standard arm, the CBT kernel intervention yielded a risk difference (RD) of 0.3% (95% CI -1.3% to 1.8%) and a risk ratio (RR) of 1.21 (95% CI 0.41-3.59); the inoculation intervention yielded an RD of -0.4% (95% CI -1.8% to 1%) and an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.19-2.44). Reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccine uptake did not differ by anxiety or depression symptoms. At baseline, approximately one-third of participants (466/1403, 33.21%) reported high willingness to receive another COVID-19 vaccine dose, with no significant differences across arms. At the 4-week follow-up, willingness remained similar across groups (CBT kernel vs standard arm: RD=-0.3%, 95% CI -6.3% to 5.8%, and RR=0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.25; inoculation vs standard arm: RD=7%, 95% CI 0.8%-13.3%, and RR=1.23, 95% CI 0.98-1.53). Willingness did not differ by mental health status. Successful efforts to increase uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine via theory-enhanced messaging remain elusive. Findings underscore the challenges of shifting behavior through messaging alone in a context of declining public trust and a diminished sense of urgency years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing research is needed to better understand and address informational and behavioral barriers to vaccination. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06119854; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06119854.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with cognitive impairments that are known to affect the outcomes of conventional treatment. Digital cognitive training programs have been examined as a possible way of addressing these overlooked challenges. Existing findings regarding the efficacy of such training programs are divergent, and further studies are warranted to examine more engaging cognitive training programs using the latest technology. Smartphone-based training built upon the principles of serious gaming would not only increase the accessibility of the program, but it could also increase the motivation of the patients, potentially maximizing adherence to the training program. The aim of the present feasibility and efficacy study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the Brain+ Alco-Recover app (Brain+ A/S) with gamified elements among patients with AUD when delivered as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU) and with minimal guidance from health care practitioners. In addition, the effects on cognitive and alcohol-related outcomes were examined. A total of 72 outpatients were randomized into either group A, experimental + TAU (n=36), or group B, sham + TAU (n=36), and they had to complete a 1-month training program in addition to primary treatment. Self-reported experience at the 6-month follow-up as well as actual game usage was used to determine the feasibility of the training program. Cognitive performance and alcohol consumption were assessed as well. The patients in both groups reported a high level of acceptability, and up to 83% of the patients in the experimental group met the minimum requirements for the usage of the app. The experimental group also demonstrated significant improvements in working memory (P&lt;.001). Although no significant differences were found between the 2 groups regarding clinical outcomes, a greater reduction in alcohol consumption was evident at the 6-month follow-up in the experimental group. The acceptability and adherence to the minimum training requirements deems the gamified Brain+ app as a feasible tool for cognitive training when delivered as an add-on to TAU. Furthermore, the potential improvements in cognitive functions should be further replicated in a larger-scale trial to assess whether these could be used to improve the treatment of AUD in the future.

    "abstract": "The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 has previously been dubbed a plasticity marker. Within the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, a SNP (rs25531) in the L-allele in the promoter region, affects the transcription efficacy of the SCL6A4, leading to functionally important differences related to serotonin transporter availability in the synapses. 5-HTTLPR has been implicated in magnitude of negative attentional bias, a causal risk factor for depression, and the modifiability of attentional biases both in positive and negative directions. Hence, this genotype may moderate the outcomes of attention bias modification (ABM) targeted at reducing depressive symptoms. We conducted a registered randomized sham-controlled trial of ABM in a sample of 301 participants with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who had residual symptoms. They were randomized and underwent 14 days of two daily session of either ABM or sham at home. Of these, 264 provided genetic samples for determining the functionally important variant of the gene SLC6A4. We investigated if the SNP (rs25531) moderated the effect of ABM on symptoms of depression (HDRS, BDI-II) and anxiety (BAI), and attention bias post-intervention. None of the outcomes were moderated by the allelic variation in the promoter region of 5-HTTLPR. Limitations include low level of depressive symptoms, lack of data on ethnicity, current and prenatal level of stress, and early traumatic experiences. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism did not moderate the effect of ABM on the symptom scales, nor attentional bias. Combination or interactions with other genes may be required for prescribing personalized interventions.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative intravenous (IV) lignocaine infusion has a minimum alveolar concentration sparing effect, and this study was designed to investigate the impact of IV lignocaine infusion on the intraoperative end-tidal desflurane (Et-Des) concentration required to maintain the Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) values between 40 and 60. Forty-eight patients were recruited for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, or ovarian cystectomy. They were randomly assigned to Group A, who received a bolus of 1.5&#x2009;mg kg&#x207b;1 of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride over 3 minutes, followed by an IV infusion of 1&#x2009;mg kg&#x207b;1 h&#x207b;1 until skin closure, and Group B, who received an equal volume of normal saline. Baseline BIS values, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure were recorded before induction of anesthesia and subsequently every 10 minutes until skin closure. Et-Des concentration, hemodynamic changes, BIS, minimum alveolar concentration, the dose of fentanyl administered, and the amount and cost of desflurane used between the 2 groups were analyzed. Et-Des concentration in Group A (4.3%&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;0.45%) was significantly lower than in Group B (5.3%&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;0.56%, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001). The cost of desflurane was significantly reduced in Group A than in Group B (Ringgit Malaysia: 35.79&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;7.43 vs Ringgit Malaysia: 46.37&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;9.75, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001). Both groups' heart rate and mean arterial pressure showed no significant differences (P&#x2005; =&#x2005;.484 and 0.619, respectively). Intravenous lignocaine infusion reduces the Et-Des concentration, amount, and cost required to maintain the BIS value at 40 to 60 without significant hemodynamic changes or side effects in laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The usage of intravenous lignocaine infusion as adjunct to anesthesia is feasible to reduce anesthetic agent requirement.",

    "title": "Exploring combined vibration and music interventions for acute stress reduction: insights from two experimental studies.",
    "abstract": "Work-related stress is increasingly recognized as a systemic issue, impacting employees' well-being and leading to severe health risks. Effective intervention strategies are crucial for addressing mental load and chronic stress. This study investigates the effects of tactile stimulation through vibrations, synchronized with heart rate and gradually decreasing in tempo, on stress reduction. Additionally, the study examines the potential synergistic effects of combining these vibrations with music.&#xa0;Study 1: objective: To explore the effectiveness of fixed and progressively slowing vibrations in reducing acute stress induced by mental load. Male participants (n=42) were randomized into three groups: variable vibration, fixed vibration, and control. Stress was measured at \"baseline\", during stress, and \"post-intervention\" using subjective assessments (tense arousal (TA) and energetic arousal (EA) scores). Statistical significance was evaluated using p-values. Participants receiving variable vibration showed a significant decrease in TA scores compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05).Study 2: Objective: To assess the combined effect of vibrations and music on stress reduction. A randomized crossover trial was conducted with 36 participants, each undergoing all three conditions: vibration with music, music only, and control, in a randomized order. Stress levels were measured using subjective evaluations (visual analog scale for stress and annoyance, Jikaku-sho shirabe, emotion and mood inventory) and objective assessment (salivary cortisol). Statistical significance was evaluated using p-values. Based on Study 1, Study 2 incorporated music and extended exposure to enhance effects. The combination of vibration and music significantly reduced VAS-Stress and VAS-Annoyance scores and increased relaxation and mood scores compared to controls (p&lt;0.05). Salivary cortisol levels also showed a more significant decrease in the combined intervention group (p&lt;0.05). Stratified analysis revealed that participants with heart rates matching the intervention tempo experienced the most significant stress reduction. Gradually decreasing tempo vibrations, particularly when combined with music, effectively reduce acute stress. These findings suggest that tactile and musical stimulation at a progressively decreasing tempo reduces subjective stress and cortisol levels. Trial registration: ISRCTN10662834.

    "title": "Objectively measured cognitive function in insomnia patients with and without comorbid depression treated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.",
    "abstract": "Insomnia and depression are common, comorbid conditions with cognitive consequences. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improves subjective cognition, but effects on objective performance are unclear. This study aims to examine cognitive differences in insomnia with and without comorbid depression, and changes in cognition following CBT-I. This study examined cognitive outcomes in 170 (124 for longitudinal analyses) participants from two randomized clinical trials of internet-delivered 9 or 12 weeks CBT-I for patients with insomnia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;78) or comorbid insomnia and depression (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;92). Cognitive performance was assessed pre- and post-treatment using selected computerized cognitive tests from the CANTAB battery. Linear regression and mixed-effects models were used for evaluation. Following CBT-I, improvements were statistically significant on seven out of 17 outcomes across patients with and without comorbid depression: the Rapid Visual Processing task (correct hits, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001, misses, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001, latency, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.040), Stockings of Cambridge (problems solved on first choice, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.042), and Affective Go/No gGo (commissions, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.005; omissions, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.022; affective bias, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.020). Comorbid depression was not statistically significantly associated with cognitive performance on most tasks. However, on the Spatial Span task, comorbid depression was associated with lower span length (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.038), fewer attempts (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.021), and longer latency (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.030), suggesting impaired spatial working memory in depressed individuals. No statistically significant associations were found between changes in insomnia or depression severity and changes in cognitive performance after treatment. Differences in cognitive performance between patients with insomnia and patients with both insomnia and depression seem very small. CBT-I may be associated with improvements in objective cognitive performance across some domains, including attention, working memory, executive function, and emotional processing. Future research should employ better control for e.g. practice effects, and explore any long-term cognitive effects of CBT-I. The present study reports follow-up analyses based on data from two previously conducted and preregistered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01663844, study registry date 2012-08-03). The current analyses explore additional outcomes not included in the primary endpoints.",

    "title": "Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment for Parents With Health Anxiety by Proxy: Replicated Randomized Single-Case Experimental Design.",
    "abstract": "Health anxiety by proxy is characterized by ruminations about severe illness in one's child that can cause severe distress in affected parents. Health anxiety by proxy may lead to repeated unnecessary medical consultations and checking the child's body for symptoms, as well as heightened attention to their child's behavior, sign of illness, and bodily symptoms. It has been hypothesized that health anxiety by proxy may pose a risk for transmission of maladaptive symptom coping and health anxiety from the parent to their child. In spite of this, no targeted treatment has previously been evaluated. Therefore, we developed an internet-delivered psychological treatment containing 8 modules based on cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effect of the internet-delivered treatment PROXY for parents with health anxiety by proxy. A total of 4 participants with health anxiety by proxy entered a replicated randomized single-case experimental design. They were randomly allocated to a baseline period of 7-26 days before entering the 8-week treatment and 14-33 days follow-up phase. The primary outcomes were daily measures of anxiety, impact of anxiety, and value-based actions measured using 5 questions answered on a scale of 1-10 through a text-message link. The primary outcomes were analyzed using visual analysis and supplemented with statistical randomization tests. Secondary outcomes were standardized questionnaire measures of anxiety-related symptoms, experience of the treatment, and negative effects of the treatment reported using descriptive statistics for each participant individually. Visual and statistical analyses indicated that PROXY was an effective treatment for 2 participants as the primary outcomes changed in the preferable direction for both of them. The effect of PROXY was questionable for the remaining 2 participants, although visual analysis showed that the impact of anxiety decreased for one of them. The 2 participants with questionable effect also thought that the treatment was too short. All 4 participants were happy with the treatment, but 2 participants experienced that health anxiety for their own health deteriorated during treatment. PROXY holds potential as a treatment for HA by proxy. However, more work is required to determine when and how PROXY should be introduced to parents with HA by proxy, particularly in relation to duration of treatment, possible comorbidities, and the need for findings to be replicated in larger groups.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are at increased risk for mental health problems, including depression. However, access to effective therapeutic interventions is often limited. To evaluate the feasibility, acceptance, and efficacy of a self-help smartphone app designed to reduce depressive symptoms and improve self-esteem and quality of life in individuals with IDs. In this 2-arm randomized clinical trial, adults with IDs and depressive symptoms were enrolled online in Germany between April 1 and August 10, 2023. Of the 135 individuals who accessed the survey, 99 met the eligibility criteria. Participants were recruited via social media, third parties (eg, care institutions), and workplaces. Data were collected at baseline and after the intervention. Statistical analyses included complete case and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention group using a smartphone app in easy-to-read German mainly on cognitive behavioral therapy or a waiting list control group. Participants in both groups continued to receive care as usual, which may include routine psychosocial support, daily structure provided by caregivers, and access to general health services. The primary outcome was a reduction in depressive symptoms, measured by the Glasgow Depression Scale for People With a Learning Disability. Secondary outcomes were improvements in self-esteem, quality of life, and participant satisfaction. Among the 99 participants (mean [SD] age, 34.9 [12.6] years; 54 [54.5%] female), 92 completed the postintervention assessment. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared with the control group in ITT analyses (F1,97&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.52; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.007; &#x3b7;p2&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.072; medium effect size), as well as significant improvements in quality of life (F1,97&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.09; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03; &#x3b7;p2&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.050; small to medium effect size) and in self-esteem (F1,97&#x2009;=&#x2009;17.94; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001; &#x3b7;p2&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.156; large effect size). Complete case analyses yielded consistent results on most outcome measures. High satisfaction ratings were reported. In this randomized clinical trial, a self-guided smartphone app demonstrated efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing quality of life and self-esteem among individuals with IDs. The findings suggest that smartphone-based interventions can provide effective support for this underserved population. German Clinical Trials Register Identifier: DRKS00030858.",

    "abstract": "Neurofeedback training (NFT) is used to modulate brain activity for therapeutic purposes in different patient populations. However, tested training protocols vary in several aspects, and the results of therapeutic benefit have been heterogeneous. The aim of the current study was to compare a SMR against a random frequency protocol and potentially strengthen NFT effects via olfactory context reactivation during sleep in a compact training protocol. 49&#x2009;participants (mean age: 24.7&#x2009;years; 29 women) without any neurological or psychiatric disorder were randomly (double-blind) assigned to three groups: sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) with or without context reactivation, or random frequencies with reactivation during sleep. Within 2&#x2009;weeks, participants underwent eight training sessions (12&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2 min training intervals) and slept three nights in the sleep lab. NFT sessions were scheduled every day or every other day for practical reasons. Nights two and three were used for reactivation. SMR training success was assessed at baseline, post treatment, and follow-up after 10&#x2009;months. Neurofeedback was provided as pixelated video, which became clearer with better training performance. Although SMR amplitude did not significantly increase, NFT training seemed to have an effect on alpha amplitude over the course of training (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08), and both SMR groups showed by tendency improved objective sleep (e.g., higher sleep efficiency in night 2 vs. baseline night, p<sub>corr</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07). Reactivation did not immediately affect performance or EEG response. However, during the follow-up session, NFT performance was highest in the SMR&#x2009;+&#x2009;reactivation condition (SMR&#x2009;+&#x2009;R&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;SMR-R, p<sub>corr</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), which could indicate a stabilizing effect of reactivation during sleep. Our data again suggest that (SMR) NFT could foster general relaxation and sleep. Concerning context reactivation, we did, however, only find limited evidence for a potential benefit. Future studies could add more reactivation nights or potentially utilize other forms of context reactivation.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative anxiety is common among adults undergoing elective surgery and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. This study evaluated the effectiveness of music intervention in reducing preoperative anxiety compared with standard care. In this randomized controlled trial, 104 women scheduled for elective gynecological surgery with elevated anxiety levels (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State scale&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;39) were enrolled. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the two sessions of preoperative music intervention (one on the eve of surgery and another in the anesthesia preparation room) or a control condition consisting of headphones without music. The primary outcome was the change in anxiety between post-intervention on the day of surgery (T3) and baseline (T0; pre-intervention on the eve of surgery). The secondary outcome included changes in anxiety levels between 24&#xa0;h postoperatively (T4) and T0; changes in blood pressure and heart rate from T0 to T3 and T4; 24-h numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores and patient's satisfaction at T4. A total of 95 patients were analysed (median age, 43.0 years). From T0 to T3, anxiety scores decreased in the music group but increased in the control group (median change, -&#x2009;5.0 vs. 3.0). The change in anxiety scores over this period differed significantly between groups (median difference=-8.0; 95% CI, -14.0 to -2.5; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, no significant between-group differences were observed in anxiety change between T4 and T0, changes in blood pressure and heart rate from T0 to T3 and T4, or 24-h NRS pain scores.

    "title": "Effect of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy on Motivation and Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication in Liver Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "After liver transplantation, recipients continue to receive immunosuppressive drug regimens at varying doses for years to ensure graft function and survival. Although liver transplant recipients are aware of the importance of immunosuppressive drug regimens, treatment compliance may decrease over time due to low motivation, putting recipients at risk of organ rejection. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) appears to be an ideal solution for increasing motivation and, indirectly, treatment compliance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ACT on adherence to immunosuppressive medication and motivation in liver transplant recipients. This study was conducted at an organ transplant hospital with the participation of recipients who had completed at least 6 months post-liver transplant. The sample included n = 140 liver transplant recipients (n = 70 experimental, n = 70 control). The study was randomized and controlled. The control group received no intervention, while the experimental group underwent an eight-session ACT program administered by a psychologist. Data collection utilized a personal characteristics form, the Adherence to Immunosuppressive Drug Regimen Scale (AIDRS), the Mindfulness Scale (MS), and the Adult Motivation Scale (AMS). Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistical methods and tests of significance for differences between variables. According to the homogeneity tests of this study, there was no statistically significant difference between the control and experimental groups in terms of individual characteristics (age, time since transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs, comorbidities, etc.). In the experimental group, the level of adherence to the immunosuppressive drug regimen after ACT was very close to the maximum AIDRS score. In the control group, the level of compliance with the immunosuppressive drug regimen was close to the mean value of the AIDRS. The differences mentioned in both groups were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the scores obtained from the MS and YMS were higher than those in the pretest. When the experimental and control groups were compared, the experimental group's final test YMS score was almost twice that of the control group, and this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). The importance of full compliance with the immunosuppressive drug regimen in improving graft function after liver transplantation is well known. The results of this study showed that liver transplant recipients who underwent ACT demonstrated higher adherence to the immunosuppressive drug regimen due to increased motivation and conscious awareness. We recommend the use of ACT to increase adherence to the immunosuppressive medication due to its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Advanced footwear technologies (AFT) improve road running performance. AFT have been incorporated into trail running footwear despite little evidence of their benefits in this context. In this study, we compared the effect of traditional (TRADI-f) and AFT foam (AFT-f) on running economy and perceptual measures across different gradients. Fourteen well-trained athletes completed assessments on a treadmill at gradients of FLAT (0% gradient, 14&#xa0;km.h<sup>-1</sup>), UP (+10%, 8&#xa0;km.h<sup>-1</sup>) and DOWN (-10%, 14&#xa0;km.h<sup>-1</sup>). Two shoes were randomly allocated in a counterbalanced order. The shoes were matched in construction but differed in midsole foam performance, where the AFT-f shoe included a more compliant and resilient foam than the TRADI-f shoe. Oxygen consumption and heart rate were collected for 6 min, twice with each shoe at each gradient, alongside perceived effort and affective measures. Across the three gradients, oxygen consumption was 1.2% lower (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008) when participants were wearing the AFT foam compared to the TRADI foam. The effect of the AFT-f shoes on oxygen consumption appeared to be more pronounced in the FLAT (+2.1%) and UP (+1.0%) conditions compared to DOWN (+0.2%). This interaction effect was, however, not statistically significant (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.050). RPE was lower (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.008) and affective valence more positive (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.027) in AFT-f compared to TRADI-f. No differences in arousal were reported between TRADI-f and AFT-f (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.728). The findings of this study suggest that an AFT foam in trail running shoes can improve running economy, reduce perceived effort and increase pleasure while running in a trained athlete population.",

    "title": "The Effects of the MONOZUKURI Program on Executive Function Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the effect of the MONOZUKURI program, a cognitive intervention related to creative activities (handicrafts and creative cooking), on cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was implemented in Kanagawa, Japan, with examiners unaware of group allocations. Fifty-one participants were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG; n = 29), which participated in 12 weekly sessions involving hands-on activities such as crafting accessories and creatively preparing sushi; and the active control group (CG; n = 22), which attended health-related educational lectures. Cognitive performance was evaluated both before and after the intervention. The main outcome measure was executive function, while secondary measures included verbal ability, attention, processing speed, memory, and working memory. Using analysis of covariance, a significant group difference was detected in the change scores of the Trail Making Test Part B, which assesses executive function, indicating greater improvement in the IG. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in the other assessed cognitive domains. The MONOZUKURI program may have some effects on executive function among community-dwelling older adults. Learning creative activity skills may contribute to the prevention of decline in executive function closely related to life functioning. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: UMIN000041679.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of a top-tier carbon plated shoe with highly responsive foam (CP-shoe) on changes in running economy (RE) and running speed at lactate threshold (LT) before, during, and after prolonged running. Ten male distance runners (half-marathon time: 75&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3&#x2009;min) completed a series of tests. Initially, two graded treadmill tests were undertaken in a well-rested state while wearing either a CP-shoe or non-carbon plated shoe (NCP-shoe) to determine RE and LT-speed (LT<sub>CP</sub> and LT<sub>NCP</sub>). On separate days, participants then performed three 80-min runs in randomized order: twice at 95% LT<sub>NCP</sub> (14.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5&#x2009;km&#xb7;h<sup>-1</sup>, once with each shoe) and once at 95% LT<sub>CP</sub> (15.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;km&#xb7;h<sup>-1</sup>, CP-shoe only). RE, blood lactate concentration ([La<sup>-</sup>]<sub>b</sub>), heart rate (HR), and perceived exertion (Borg scale) were recorded throughout. Each 80-min run was followed by a graded exercise test with assessment of RE and LT-speed. At matched external workload (95% LT<sub>NCP</sub>), the CP-shoe improved RE and lowered [La<sup>-</sup>]<sub>b</sub>, HR, and Borg compared with the NCP-shoe. At matched internal workload (95% LT specific to each shoe), the CP-shoe again demonstrated superior RE and lower HR. However, the time course of changes during the 80-min runs did not differ between shoes (i.e., no shoe &#xd7; time interactions). Across all 80-min runs, LT-speed and RE improved postexercise, with the CP-shoe yielding higher LT speeds than the NCP-shoe (+0.5-0.6&#x2009;km&#xb7;h<sup>-1</sup>). In conclusion, the CP-shoe enhanced RE and reduced perceived exertion and [La<sup>-</sup>]<sub>b</sub> compared with the normal running shoe during prolonged running, although the magnitude of changes over time was not different between shoes.",

    "title": "Impact of Adherence to Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Effectiveness.",
    "abstract": "Although digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) offers a promising solution to the accessibility limitations of traditional face-to-face CBT-I, few studies have examined dCBT-I against a sham app and adherence issues remain. This study assessed the efficacy of dCBT-I compared with a sham app and investigated whether adherence predicts sleep outcomes. In this combined analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized controlled trials, 120 patients with insomnia were randomized to use the dCBT-I app (n=60) or a sham app (n=60). The primary outcome was the change in sleep efficiency (SE) from baseline after the 6-week intervention. The relationship between adherence to sleep restriction therapy (SRT) and sleep outcomes post-intervention was assessed. After adjusting for age, sex, sleep medication use, and baseline levels of each outcome variable, the dCBT-I group demonstrated better treatment outcomes than the sham app group, with significant improvements of 7.69% in SE [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.09% to 12.30%; <i>p</i>=0.001], -16.77 minutes in sleep onset latency (95% CI, -31.48 to -2.06 minutes; <i>p</i>=0.026), and -0.97 in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (95% CI, -1.46 to -0.48; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) from baseline. Poorer adherence to SRT was associated with reduced SE (<i>p</i>=0.006) and increased nighttime wakefulness (<i>p</i>=0.002) after controlling for age, sex, years of education, and the baseline value of each outcome variable. This combined analysis demonstrates the efficacy of dCBT-I in improving sleep outcomes compared with a sham app and highlights the role of adherence to SRT in enhancing treatment efficacy. The two studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05822999, NCT05809544).",

Systematic review with meta-analysis. Adults with a chronic lung disease. Any non-pharmacological intervention, other than exercise training, applied to reduce dyspnoea or improve health-related quality of life. Dyspnoea, measured at rest, on exertion or during daily activities, and health-related quality of life measured using a validated questionnaire. CINAHL, PEDro, PubMed and EMBASE were searched.

Thirteen randomised controlled trials and two randomised cross-over trials met the study criteria. For adults with obstructive lung diseases, low quality evidence suggests that pursed lip breathing may result in a moderate reduction in dyspnoea when measured within 3 months of treatment initiation (SMD -0.45), although the effect may be substantially larger or smaller (95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). Similarly, breathing re-training may result in small to moderate improvements in health-related quality of life when measured &#x2265; 3 months following treatment initiation (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14).

    "title": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Parents of Children With Cancer: An RCT.",
    "abstract": "To examine the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on reducing psychological distress and promoting quality of life (QoL) in parents of children with cancer. A 2-arm paralleled randomized controlled trial was conducted with the intervention group receiving a 4-session weekly ACT-based intervention and the control group receiving the usual care. The primary outcomes were parental psychological distress and QoL. Secondary outcomes were parental experience of child's illness, experiential avoidance, psychological flexibility, and child's psychological adjustment to cancer. Data were collected at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and 3&#xa0;months after the intervention (T2). A total of 142 children and their parents were recruited. Generalized estimating equation analyses showed that the intervention group reported significantly positive changes in parental psychological distress (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-13.54, 95% CI: -20.04 to -7.03, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001 at T1; &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-11.86, 95% CI: -18.92 to -4.80, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001 at T2) and QoL (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.61, 95% CI: 3.42 to 13.80, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001 at T1; &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.52, 95% CI: 2.79, 14.26, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004 at T2) compared with those in the control group. Parents who received ACT-based intervention also reported significantly less negative experience of child's illness, less experiential avoidance, and more psychological flexibility. Meanwhile, parents in the intervention group reported significantly greater reductions in the difficulties of psychological adjustment in their children. The 4-session ACT-based intervention represents a promising approach for reducing psychological distress and improving QoL in the parents of children with cancer.",

    "title": "The Role of Self-Compassion in Teachers' Well-Being: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Studies revealed that teachers frequently experience stress and a decline in job satisfaction. This meta-analysis examined the association between teacher well-being measures and self-compassion, as well as the impact of mindfulness interventions on these traits. The study synthesises data from 19 studies, encompassing a total of 4420 teachers. It reveals a significant positive correlation between teacher well-being and self-compassion. Specifically, self-compassion inversely correlates with stress levels (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.49) and positively correlates with job satisfaction (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32). Furthermore, mindfulness interventions have been shown to substantially enhance both self-compassion (Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77) and mindfulness (Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78) among teachers. These findings suggest that mindfulness interventions can effectively increase self-compassion, thereby improving teacher well-being. The positive association between self-compassion and teacher well-being underscores the potential benefits of targeted interventions to enhance these traits. However, further high-quality research is necessary to optimise interventions aimed at augmenting teacher self-compassion. This is crucial for fostering greater teacher well-being and effectiveness in educational settings.",

    "title": "The REDUCE Intervention: The Development of a Person-Centred Cognitive Behavioural Intervention to Improve Ulcer Outcomes in People at Risk of Diabetic Foot Ulceration.",
    "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) affect approximately one-quarter of people living with diabetes. They are chronic, recur frequently and are associated with significant psychological distress and behavioural challenges. The REDUCE intervention is a person-centred, cognitive behavioural intervention designed to reduce the risk of DFU recurrence and support ulcer healing. Here, we describe the iterative development and optimisation of REDUCE, from its inception as a group-based intervention to an individually tailored intervention delivered via video call or telephone. We outline key stages of the intervention development, including the integration and modification of a digital maintenance intervention (DMI) designed to support long-term behaviour change and a mixed-methods external pilot trial which informed a full-scale clinical and cost-effectiveness trial. After initial development, the DMI was the subject of nine 'think-aloud' interviews with patient and public contributors. We conducted an external pilot randomised controlled trial, involving 20 patients with recently healed DFUs randomised in a 2:1 ratio (REDUCE&#x2009;+&#x2009;Usual Care vs. Usual Care only). Data collection included patient-reported outcome measures (baseline and 6 weeks and 3 months post-randomisation) and qualitative interviews with participants and facilitators. Think-aloud interviews informed key refinements to the DMI to enhance usability and engagement. The pilot trial demonstrated high acceptability of the intervention format and delivery. Patient-reported outcomes suggested positive trends in psychological well-being, footcare behaviours and mood among intervention participants. Qualitative findings highlighted the value of individualised delivery, the importance of facilitator support and varied engagement with the DMI. These insights informed further refinements to REDUCE ahead of a full-scale effectiveness trial. We provide a comprehensive account of the evolution of the REDUCE intervention and share broader learnings regarding the development of complex behavioural health interventions. The example of REDUCE highlights the value of iterative, multidisciplinary methods and patient involvement in intervention design and offers practical insights for designing digital and remote health interventions. Patient and public contributors were involved throughout the research described in this manuscript. Key areas of involvement included co-creation of all patient-facing materials, intervention development and informing trial methods.",

    "abstract": "According to recent empirical taxonomies (eg, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology), somatic symptom distress represents a transdiagnostically relevant dimension of psychopathology. To better understand the mechanisms, somatic symptoms can be experimentally provoked by inducing negative affect (in the Affect and Symptom Paradigm, ASP, formerly known as the Affective Picture Paradigm). Potential moderators of this relation include cardiorespiratory activation and body-focused attention. In this preregistered, cross-sectional study ( https://osf.io/sc57z/ ), we tested whether cardiorespiratory activation and body-focused attention modulate somatic symptoms in the ASP. Participants ( ) completed 3 ASPs, interlaced with cardiorespiratory activation (cycling) and rest. Participants were randomized to a body-attention or distraction condition. We measured heart rate, respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO 2 during these tasks. The data were analyzed using AN(C)OVAs, t tests, and multilevel models. Exercise significantly increased, and rest significantly decreased immediatesomatic symptoms ( ). High levels of somatic symptoms were significantly related to a sustained greater decrease in somatic symptoms in the ASP after cycling (vs. rest, . No significant effect of the attention manipulation was observed ( ). Rest and exercise temporarily modulate somatic symptom reports, and people with higher baseline somatic symptoms show the strongest beneficial effect of physical activity on symptom reports in the ASP. The findings are compatible with recent models of predictive processing and active inference.",

The IG showed a significant LF/HF change (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013), and the CG had a significant SD1/SD2 change (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02) in intra-group comparisons. No significant differences were found between IG and CG for variables such as SDNN, NN50, PNN50&#xa0;%, SD1, SD2, LF/HF, and SD1/SD2. Both interventions induced HRV changes without significant intergroup differences, suggesting uncontrolled factors may influence the autonomic response. Instrument-assisted chiropractic manipulation of C1 did not significantly change HRV vs. placebo, indicating the need for further studies on external variables.",

    "title": "Exercise during artificial gravity preserves cardiorespiratory fitness but not orthostatic tolerance following 60 days of head-down bed rest (BRACE).",
    "abstract": "Exercise is a critical countermeasure to prevent cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight; however, exercise does not protect astronauts from postflight orthostatic intolerance. Artificial gravity (AG) by short-arm centrifugation can attenuate reductions in orthostatic tolerance following prolonged head-down bed rest (HDBR), but AG does not protect cardiorespiratory fitness. The European Space Agency hypothesized that exercise and AG countermeasures could be applied simultaneously to protect both cardiorespiratory fitness and orthostatic tolerance following prolonged HDBR. Twenty-four healthy men (age: 29 &#xb1; 6 yr, peak oxygen uptake: 47.5 &#xb1; 6.0 mL&#xb7;min<sup>-1</sup>&#xb7;kg<sup>-1</sup>) completed 60 days of HDBR and were randomized into either sedentary control (<i>n</i> = 8), exercise (<i>n</i> = 8), or exercise + AG (<i>n</i> = 8) groups. Exercise participants performed 30 min of high-intensity interval cycling on 49 of 60 days during HDBR. The exercise + AG group performed the same 30-min exercise program while spinning in supine position in a short-arm centrifuge to generate a head-to-foot acceleration. Peak oxygen uptake (HDBR &#xd7; group: <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was reduced in the control group following HDBR (&#x394; = -24 &#xb1; 5%) but was protected by the exercise (&#x394; = 0 &#xb1; 6%) and exercise + AG (&#x394; = 4 &#xb1; 6%) countermeasures. Time to presyncope was reduced in all groups (control: &#x394; = -9.0 &#xb1; 3.4 min, exercise: &#x394; = -12.4 &#xb1; 5.2 min, exercise + AG: &#x394; = -4.5 &#xb1; 8.8 min) following HDBR (main effect: <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Activation of the muscle pump during exercise likely minimized the redistribution of blood volume into the legs and consequently, the simulated orthostatic stress experienced during centrifugation, preventing benefits of exercise + AG on orthostatic tolerance following HDBR. Therefore, AG by short-arm centrifugation should be implemented at rest or postexercise to protect orthostatic tolerance.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Exposing participants to artificial gravity (AG) while performing high-intensity interval cycling protects cardiorespiratory fitness after 60 days of head-down bed rest but not orthostatic tolerance. These effects are not different than performing exercise without AG. Accordingly, to gain the previously reported benefits of AG by short-arm centrifugation on the cardiovascular system, AG should be applied while participants are at rest or postexercise.",

    "abstract": "Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) are a constellation of disorders posited to share an underlying pain mechanism (nociplastic pain). Unfortunately, individuals with COPCs are under-represented in clinical research. The current study aimed to determine COPC prevalence among participants enrolled in a pragmatic clinical trial and compare those with COPCs to those with non-COPCs across several domains. Learning to Apply Mindfulness to Pain (LAMP) study baseline data of veterans with chronic pain (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;811) were utilised. COPC diagnoses were determined using ICD-10 codes within electronic health records. Group differences across pain and functioning-related domains were compared with and without adjustment for age and gender. Among participants with COPCs (54%), most were diagnosed with only one COPC (74%). Chronic lower back pain (71%) and migraine (28%) were the most common. Participants with COPCs were younger and more likely to be female relative to those with non-COPCs. The COPC subset was also more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD, depressive disorders and sleep disorders (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Those with COPCs also reported greater pain severity and interference, more impaired health-related quality of life, greater pain catastrophising and lower pain self-efficacy than participants without COPCs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). COPCs were common among a sample of veterans in a pragmatic clinical trial. Several baseline differences emerged indicating veterans with COPCs experience greater mental health concerns and endorse distinct pain characteristics and pain mediators. Future research is needed to further characterise this recently defined and under-represented group. Individuals with COPCs are medically complex, yet are understudied and underrepresented within pain trials research. COPCs, which predominantly impact women, are also understudied within U.S. veterans. Our findings highlight how veterans with COPCs are participating in clinical research even when interventions are not tailored to their unique characteristics. Our work also contributes to a nuanced understanding of this disease burden and is among the first to describe differences among veterans with COPCs and veterans with chronic pain but without COPCs.",

Similarly, the HIIT-20S group outperformed the HIIT-30S group in the 10S-HRK test (3.62% vs. 0.91%), whereas the HIIT-30S group outperformed the 60S-DCK test (3.45% vs. 1.91%). Improvements in agility favored the HIIT-20S group (-8.26% vs. HIIT-30S: -4.01%; control: -0.85%). Both HIIT groups showed enhanced heart rate recovery (HIIT-30S, 2.74% and HIIT-20S, 2.57%), although no significant differences were observed in lower limb maximal strength. These findings confirm the specificity of the work-to-rest ratio: HIIT-30S effectively enhances cardiorespiratory endurance and repeated kicking endurance, whereas HIIT-20S appears to be more beneficial for optimizing explosive strength, agility, kick speed, and frequency.",

    "title": "ACTing with Mindfulness for Pain (AMP): A pilot randomized controlled trial of an integrated acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness meditation program.",
    "abstract": "Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an empirically-supported psychotherapy for chronic pain. Although mindfulness is a key component of ACT, most ACT protocols do not include formal mindfulness meditation practice as a principal treatment method, leaving open the question of whether formal practice may bolster ACT's effects. Addressing this gap, the present study assessed the feasibility and preliminary treatment effects of ACTing with Mindfulness for Pain (AMP), an ACT-based protocol that emphasizes and measures daily formal mindfulness meditation practice. A total of 87 Veterans (M<sub>age</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;49.44, SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;12.42) were randomized to AMP or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Feasibility was supported by attainment of enrollment targets, achievement of retention rates at post-treatment greater than 80&#xa0;%, and high levels of treatment credibility and satisfaction. Treatment expectancy was lower than hypothesized in both groups. Within the AMP group, there were significant improvements in pain interference (primary outcome; d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.58), pain acceptance (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.72), cognitive defusion (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.23) and pain catastrophizing (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.50) at posttreatment. Within the CBT group, there were significant improvements in pain interference (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.59), pain acceptance (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.50), and pain catastrophizing (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.39) at posttreatment. In both groups, effect sizes were reduced at 3-month follow-up. Home meditation practice was dose-dependently associated with a greater reduction of depressive symptoms and pain-related helplessness in the AMP group. Taken together, despite meeting important feasibility metrics, the effect size estimates from this pilot randomized controlled trial highlight the need for further treatment development before moving to formal efficacy evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) adds important information about the quality and usefulness of interventions. It has not previously been examined in school-based indicated prevention for anxiety in adolescents. Using secondary analyses of data from a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions for anxious adolescents (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;302; mean age 14), we examined whether HRQOL increased during and after treatment. Additionally, we examined whether changes and pre-treatment levels in anxiety and depression symptoms predicted changes in and final levels of HRQOL. This was done using latent growth curve modeling. Results showed that the interventions increased levels of HRQOL and that the levels of HRQOL were sustained at 1-year follow-up, independent of the timing of change. Pre-treatment levels and changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted the changes and final levels in HRQOL. The results indicate that the school-based indicated-preventive interventions may have benefits on HRQOL in addition to reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression and that these benefits are associated with changes in symptoms.",

Ten healthy women aged 64 &#xb1; 2 (SD) yr participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and crossover study. All participants underwent 2-wk beetroot juice (BRJ: 800 mg nitrate/day) and placebo (nitrate-depleted BRJ) interventions with &#x2265;14 days of washout. Before and after each intervention, participants performed static handgrip (SHG) at 40% of maximum voluntary contraction until fatigue, followed by 2-min post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) with an upper arm cuff inflated to 250 mmHg to isolate metaboreflex activation. Heart rate (electrocardiogram), blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; microneurography) were continuously measured. BRJ increased the time to fatigue more than placebo (&#x394;79 &#xb1; 67 vs. &#x394;9 &#xb1; 74 s, <i>P</i> = 0.03), which was correlated with decreases in MSNA burst frequency, total activity, and burst incidence at the first 30 s of SHG when predominately mechanoreflex activation occurs (<i>r</i> = -0.65, -0.62, and -0.68, respectively, all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). However, BRJ did not alter MSNA responses to peak SHG and PECO. Subsequently, we added four postmenopausal women who finished the BRJ intervention only and categorized all participants into early (<i>n</i> = 6) and normal menopause (<i>n</i> = 8). The early, but not normal, menopause group showed decreases in MSNA burst frequency and incidence at the first 30 s of SHG after the BRJ intervention (both <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Collectively, nitrate supplementation prolonged the time to fatigue during SHG, and this prolongation was likely associated with attenuated sympathetic neural responses to mechanoreflex activation in postmenopausal women, especially those with early menopause.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> Menopause induces augmented sympathetic responses to exercise, which may be related to the risk of exercise intolerance. Here, we found that short-term dietary nitrate supplementation in postmenopausal women prolonged the time to fatigue during static handgrip, and the prolongation was associated with suppressed MSNA responses at the onset of exercise. These results suggest that dietary nitrate supplementation could improve isometric exercise endurance in postmenopausal women through suppressing sympathetic neural responses to mechanoreflex activation.",

Although many recover naturally, a significant minority develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or alcohol misuse. Intervening acutely can prevent chronic psychopathology from developing. This study tested the efficacy of a newly developed one-session&#xa0;+&#xa0;four coaching call intervention (BRITE) adapted from Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an evidence-based treatment for chronic PTSD. Individuals over 18, who identified as female, with symptoms of PTSD and alcohol misuse were recruited within 10 weeks of sexual assault for a RCT comparing BRITE to symptom monitoring. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;57) were young (M&#xa0;=&#xa0;21.63 years) and predominately White (61.4&#xa0;%). PTSD and alcohol use were assessed at baseline, weekly for 5 weeks, and at 3-month follow-up by masked evaluators.

    "abstract": "Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is an urgent global health priority given its high prevalence and impact as the leading cause of disability. While several efficacious treatments exist, most have modest effects. Improving outcomes requires a better understanding of treatment mechanisms to enable optimisation. This study explored the mechanisms of cognitive functional therapy (CFT), a biopsychosocial intervention with large, durable effects for adults with disabling CLBP. A longitudinal mediation analysis was performed on data from the RESTORE multisite clinical trial comparing CFT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;327) to usual care (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;165). Mediators (self-efficacy, fear, catastrophising, and pain intensity) were specified based on behavioural theories underlying CFT and previous research. The joint mediation of treatment effects on disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain intensity (numerical rating scale), were examined using a counterfactual framework for mediation analysis. As hypothesised, earlier changes in self-efficacy, fear, catastrophising, and pain intensity mediated improvements in disability at the end of treatment and at 12-month follow-up, explaining up to 61&#xa0;% of the effect. Similarly, self-efficacy, fear, and catastrophising mediated the effect of CFT on pain intensity, explaining up to 62&#xa0;% of the effect. Results are consistent with previous CLBP mediation research highlighting self-efficacy, fear, and catastrophising as likely common mechanisms among effective biopsychosocial treatments. CFT demonstrates large, durable, and clinically important effects on these mechanisms. Findings shed light for clinicians and researchers on how CFT works, although the role of other mechanisms such as movement changes requires further exploration, along with research analysing how different treatment components activate these mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Individuals who work in the heat, such as military personnel and athletes, are often required to rapidly transition from temperate or cooler climates to hot environments. Thus, acclimation strategies are needed for individuals lacking access to hot weather. We sought to develop and validate a practical exercise with overdressing protocol for heat acclimation. We began by using biophysical modeling to identify a combination of clothing and treadmill exercise (speed/duration) predicted to facilitate appropriate increases in core temperature in a gym-like environment (20&#xb0;C/50% RH/1 mph wind). We tested this novel protocol (6 mph run for 30 min followed by 3.5 mph walk for 60 min in a standardized overdressing ensemble) against control exercise (shorts/t-shirt) using two randomized crossover trials in fit males and females. In <i>study I</i>, we showed that a single session of exercise with overdressing elicited significantly higher peak core temperature (38.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4 vs. 38.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.3&#xb0;C), skin temperature (35.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6 vs. 32.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.7&#xb0;C), and heart rate (166&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;20 vs. 147 &#xb1; 16 beats/min) compared with control exercise (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01; <i>n</i> = 15).

    "abstract": "Mindfulness practices, such as the body scan, could enhance interoception. While prior research shows promise for its effects on interoceptive sensibility (IS; subjective experience of bodily cues) and accuracy (IAcc; accurate detection of bodily signals), studies often use a limited set of interoceptive variables or apply small samples. In two pre-registered randomized trials, we examined a 2-week daily auditory body scan intervention vs. active control (guided imagery; Study 1) or passive control (Study 2). Study 1 included N&#x2009;=&#x2009;85 participants (M<sub>age</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;22.26, 71% women), randomized to body scan or guided imagery.

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of including behavioural rehearsal (i.e., expert demonstration followed by role-playing treatment components) in the training of clinical psychology students in cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder. A randomized controlled design was used where fifth year clinical psychology students (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;94, M age&#xa0;= 26.2 years, SD&#xa0;= 3.81) were randomized to behavioural rehearsal or a bona fide control training condition (expert demonstration and discussions), as part of a 16-h training course in cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorders. Videotapes (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;94) of participants role-playing therapists after training were rated for therapist competence (primary outcome measured by three competence variables) by raters who were unaware of the training condition allocation. Secondary outcomes (therapists' self-efficacy, therapist worry levels and satisfaction with training) were collected by self-report at post-training and at 6-month follow-up. Participants in the behavioural rehearsal condition achieved higher competence scores compared to the control condition. Differences between groups were found for all three competence variables, with large effect sizes (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.23-1.40, 95&#xa0;% CI [.78, 1.85]). Large between-group effect sizes were also found for all individual items of competence (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;.80-1.22, 95&#xa0;% CI [.38, 1.66]). No effects were found for secondary outcomes. The results suggest that inclusion of behavioural rehearsal in training leads to higher competence among clinical psychology students when delivering cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder. Training providers should consider incorporating behavioural rehearsal in cognitive therapy training.",

    "abstract": "Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is extremely common and is one of the Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPCs), 10 conditions thought to have similar underlying pathophysiology. Little is known about the prevalence and co-occurrence of cLBP with other commonly accepted conditions referred to as COPCs. We assessed participants enrolled in a pragmatic trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction for cLBP to determine the prevalence of co-occurring COPCs using a validated COPC screener. We compared psychosocial and physical functioning among participants with only cLBP and participants with cLBP and additional COPCs using Student's t-tests, chi-squared tests and multivariable linear regression. Among 285 enrollees (age range: 18-88&#x2009;years, mean age: 52.2&#x2009;years, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;15.3), 272 (95%) reported pain outside the upper and lower back region. One hundred and twenty-nine people (45%) had one COPC, and 68 (24%) had two or more COPCs not including cLBP. The most common COPCs were irritable bowel syndrome (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56, 20%); myalgia encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54, 19%); and fibromyalgia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;42, 15%). We found strong differences when comparing people with cLBP alone to those with cLBP and COPCs. People with COPCs reported more pain symptoms, higher levels of anxiety, depression, fatigue and scored worse across measures of physical functioning and pain symptoms. An additional COPC was associated with a 7.6-point increase in fatigue scores (95% CI: 5.6, 9.7) on a T-score metric (mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;50, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;10). Compared to people with low back pain alone, individuals with additional chronic pain experienced more severe pain symptoms, more anxiety, depression and fatigue.

    "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations (AHs) affect 60-80 % of schizophrenia patients and often resist antipsychotic treatment. AHs involve superior temporal gyrus (STG) hyperactivity and disrupted auditory-cognitive control connectivity. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NFB) enables voluntary modulation of targeted brain regions. We previously showed STG-targeted NFB with mindfulness meditation reduced STG activation and AHs in one session. However, whether effects are specific to hallucination-related regions versus placebo, and whether NFB modulates broader networks, remained unclear. This randomized, sham-controlled trial examined NFB specificity and network effects. Twenty-three adults with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and medication-resistant hallucinations practiced mindfulness meditation while receiving neurofeedback from either STG (n = 10, Real-NFB) or motor cortex (n = 13, Sham-NFB control). Sham participants subsequently received Real-NFB, providing within-subject comparison. Both groups showed reduced AHs post-NFB without group differences. However, compared to Sham-NFB, Real-NFB produced greater reductions in secondary auditory cortex activation and connectivity between auditory cortex and cognitive control regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate). These connectivity reductions persisted in the Real-after-Sham condition. Both groups showed reduced primary auditory cortex activation, suggesting mindfulness meditation independently regulates bottom-up hallucination processes. Region-specific NFB targeting produces distinct neural changes beyond symptom reduction. STG-targeted NFB differentially modulates auditory-cognitive control networks, potentially restoring the disrupted balance between bottom-up sensory processing and top-down control in AHs. These findings highlight the importance of anatomically-informed NFB targets and provide mechanistic insights for developing precision interventions for treatment-resistant psychiatric symptoms.",

The findings showed ACT had a significant effect on depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.69, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.32, P&lt;0.001, Certainty: Low) and anxiety symptoms (SMD=-0.64, 95% CI: -0.92 to -0.36, P&lt;0.001, Certainty: Moderate) among individuals with depression, while also showing a positive effect on psychological flexibility (SMD=0.35, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.61, P=0.008, Certainty: High). Further subgroup results showed that group ACT appeared to be more effective than individual ACT: improving depressive symptom significantly better compared to controls. These findings offer an evidence-based, reliable intervention strategy for clinical practice. More rigorous, multicenter and larger-sample size RCTs are warranted to enhance the validity of these findings.",

    "abstract": "Migraines are among the top causes of global disability and are often managed with pharmacological treatments, which may produce adverse effects. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged as promising non-pharmacological approaches, yet existing studies report mixed findings. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effectiveness of MBIs in improving pain, psychological, and functional outcomes among adults with migraine. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults (&#x2265;18&#xa0;years) with a clinical diagnosis of migraine. Four databases-Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest Central-were searched from 1982 to July 2025. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 4 and R. Fourteen RCTs with 1027 participants were included. MBIs were associated with significant reductions in pain intensity (standardized mean difference: 0.23 [95&#xa0;% CI: 0.11-0.35]) and pain frequency (0.33 [0.11-0.54]), as well as improvements in quality of life (0.24 [0.08-0.40]). Psychological outcomes improved significantly, including anxiety (0.37 [0.14-0.61]), depression (0.26 [0.06-0.45]), and pain catastrophizing (0.57 [0.35-0.80]). No significant effects were found for activity-related disability (0.18 [-0.01-0.38]) or use of analgesic medications (0.07 [-0.06-0.20]) and triptans (0.04 [-0.13-0.21]). MBIs may serve as effective complements to pharmacological treatments for migraine. They significantly reduce pain intensity, attack frequency, and psychological symptoms, while modestly improving quality of life. These findings support integrating mindfulness practices into routine migraine care to promote psychological well-being and reduce symptom burden.",

    "abstract": "To determine the recovery kinetics of performance, muscle damage, and neuromuscular fatigue following 2 speed-endurance maintenance training (SEMT) protocols in soccer. Ten well-trained male soccer athletes randomly completed 3 trials: work-to-rest ratio SEMT/1:3, SEMT/1:1, and a control trial. Training load during SEMT was monitored using a global positioning system and heart-rate monitors. Isokinetic strength of knee extensors and flexors; repeated-sprint ability (RSA); speed 10-, 30-m, countermovement jump (CMJ); and muscle damage (delayed-onset muscle soreness [DOMS]&#xa0;and creatine kinase) markers were evaluated at baseline and at 0, 24, 48, and 72&#xa0;hours posttraining. Maximal voluntary contraction of knee extensors and flexors was additionally assessed at 1, 2, and 3&#xa0;hours posttraining. Strength (eccentric torque) and speed performance (RSA, 10-m and 30-m sprint times) were reduced (P &lt; .05) following the SEMT/1:3 for up to 72 and 48&#xa0;hours, respectively, and following SEMT/1:1 for up to 48 and &#x2264;24&#xa0;hours, respectively. Eccentric torque and RSA deterioration was greater in SEMT/1:3 compared to SEMT/1:1 at 72&#xa0;hours and immediately postexercise, respectively (P &lt; .05). Indicators of neuromuscular fatigue (CMJ and maximal voluntary contraction) declined in SEMT/1:3 at 24 and 2&#xa0;hours postexercise (P &lt; .05) and in SEMT/1:1 immediately and at 2&#xa0;hours postexercise (P &lt; .05). Muscle damage (DOMS) in the knee flexors was elevated in both SEMT protocols for up to 48&#xa0;hours (P &lt; .05). SEMT/1:3 induces short-term neuromuscular fatigue; provokes a decrease of strength (48-72&#xa0;h), speed and RSA (48&#xa0;h), and jump height (24&#xa0;h); and is related with an elevation of knee flexors' DOMS (48&#xa0;h). Increased work-to-rest ratio causes higher levels of exercise-induced muscle damage.",

    "abstract": "Attentional bias (AB), characterized by a disproportionate allocation of attention toward threat-related stimuli, constitutes a well-established cognitive mechanism underlying anxiety disorders. As a targeted intervention, attentional bias modification (ABM) has garnered substantial empirical support for its efficacy in attenuating AB and ameliorating anxiety symptomatology. This study evaluated and compared the effectiveness of three major ABM training paradigms in reducing attentional bias manifestations: dot-probe task-based ABM (DPT-ABM), emotional spatial cueing task-based ABM (ESCT-ABM), and visual search task-based ABM (VST-ABM). Using the attention to negative inventory (ANI) scale, we screened 202 non-clinical adolescents exhibiting elevated levels of negative attentional bias (NAB) and randomly assigned them to either an active modification group (DPT-ABM, ESCT-ABM, or VST-ABM) or a matched control group (DPT-C, ESCT-C, or VST-C). Participants underwent eight offline training sessions across a four-week period. Attentional bias scores (ABS), learning anxiety, and sense of agency (SoA) were assessed at pre-test and post-test intervals. Additionally, a three-month follow-up evaluation was conducted to examine long-term changes in ABS. The results showed that VST-ABM led to significant and sustained reductions in ABS compared to its control group, while other paradigms did not produce such effects. This study provides new evidence that active search training for positive emotional stimuli in VST-ABM is more effective than passive avoidance training of negative stimuli in reducing negative attentional bias and improving emotional well-being in non-clinical adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with hypertension being a major risk factor. Yoga Nidra (YGN), a guided meditative practice focused on relaxation, has gained attention for its potential cardiovascular effects. Despite this, a clear understanding of YGN's efficacy remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of YGN on various cardiovascular parameters. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across seven academic databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest, as well as one trial database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized trials and the Downs and Black checklist for non-randomized studies. A comprehensive literature search across seven databases identified 620 articles, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The quality assessment revealed that most included studies had methodological limitations. The between-group meta-analysis demonstrated significant small-to-large effect improvements in systolic blood pressure (Hedges' g: -1.65), diastolic blood pressure (-1.01), heart rate (-0.73), and heart rate variability parameters such as low to high frequency ratio (-0.35), when YGN was compared to active control groups. These findings were supported by within-group analyses and leave-one-out sensitivity tests. The results indicate that YGN practice was associated with improvements in cardiovascular health markers across the analyzed studies. However, the methodological limitations identified in the current literature indicates that high-quality, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for YGN's effectiveness in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate whether antihypertensives affect fetal (FHR) or neonatal (neoHR) heart rate. Electronic databases and clinical trial registers were searched to August 31, 2024. Eligibility included randomized (RCTs) or observational studies evaluating antihypertensives for pregnancy hypertension. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Random effects meta-analysis was used to determine risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Network meta-analysis was undertaken in a sensitivity analysis. Fifty-four RCTs (n =&#x2009;5736 pregnancies) and 28 observational studies (n =&#x2009;2&#x2009;283&#x2009;855) reported FHR (usually visually-interpreted) or neoHR (usually clinically-assessed). FHR: NON-SEVERE HYPERTENSION: Antihypertensives did not increase adverse FHR effects in RCTs of antihypertensives versus placebo/no therapy (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.08, 95% CI [0.62-1.89]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;43%; N =&#x2009;10, n =&#x2009;1567 pregnancies), antihypertensives versus methyldopa (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.40 [0.97-2.04]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;0%; N =&#x2009;6, n =&#x2009;515), or labetalol or pure beta-blockers versus other antihypertensives (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.70 [0.96-2.99]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;30%; N =&#x2009;5, n =&#x2009;501). In observational studies, adverse FHR effects were more common with: labetalol versus methyldopa, nifedipine or Chinese herbal medication (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.17 [1.15-4.08]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;47%; N =&#x2009;4, n =&#x2009;664), and bendroflumethiazide versus metoprolol (but not hydralazine), but 95% CIs were wide. FHR: SEVERE HYPERTENSION: Antihypertensives had no FHR effects in RCTs of antihypertensives versus either: placebo/no therapy (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43 [0.16-1.20]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;0%; N =&#x2009;3, n =&#x2009;242), hydralazine (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.71 [0.29-1.72]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;13%; N =&#x2009;11, n =&#x2009;727), or CCBs (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.52 [0.12-2.16]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;0%, N =&#x2009;9, n =&#x2009;1675). In observational studies, there was no difference for labetalol versus other antihypertensives (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.34 [0.10-1.14], I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;87%; N =&#x2009;4, n =&#x2009;590), with heterogeneity due to a lower-quality labetalol versus hydralazine study. There were fewer adverse FHR effects for nifedipine versus hydralazine study (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09 [0.01-0.68]; n =&#x2009;49). SEVERE HYPERTENSION: RCTs of antihypertensives versus placebo/no therapy were not associated with adverse neoHR effects (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.26 [0.31-5.19]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;66%; N =&#x2009;4, n =&#x2009;406), with heterogeneity attributed to more neoHR effects with continuously monitored neoHR. Observational studies revealed no effect on neoHR of antihypertensives versus no therapy (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.06 [0.67-1.67]; I<sup>2</sup> =&#x2009;54%; N =&#x2009;4, n =&#x2009;37&#x2009;359), but labetalol was associated with more adverse effects and metoprolol with fewer. In RCTs of antihypertensives versus other antihypertensives, there was no difference in adverse neoHR (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.0 [0.13-71.74]; N =&#x2009;3, n =&#x2009;162).

No severe hypertension RCTs reported neoHR. Observational studies were limited. Network meta-analysis showed no significant relationships between antihypertensives and FHR or neoHR; 95% CIs were very wide. Evidence is inadequate to draw reliable conclusions about the impact of antihypertensives on FHR or neoHR. At present, adverse FHR or neoHR effects should be attributed to evolving placental dysfunction.",

    "title": "Diaphragmatic breathing for referred pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomized clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "Referred cervicoscapular pain is common after laparoscopic surgery. This pain has different characteristics from incisional pain and requires a different approach. A blinded, randomized, controlled trial was conducted. Women reporting referred pain with an intensity of 7 points or higher on the visual analogue scale after total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) were randomly assigned to a diaphragmatic breathing group (DBG) or a neck exercise group (NEG). Both groups performed the exercises three times daily, and the usual medical care was maintained. Pain intensity and location were assessed using the McGill questionnaire. Specific self-reported questionnaires were used to assess the evolution of functional disability in the head (HIT-6), shoulder and neck (NDI), or upper limbs (QuickDASH). Follow-up was conducted weekly for 4&#xa0;weeks after surgery. Seventy-four women (43.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9,5&#xa0;years; 26.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.9 body mass index) were recruited. The most common area of referred pain was the shoulder and neck (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55), followed by the head (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;48) and upper limbs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14), with four women showing pain in all three areas and thirty-five in two areas. Both groups showed improvement over time in pain intensity and functional disability in all the locations (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0,001). However, DBG demonstrated a faster recovery for pain intensity, NDI, and HIT-6 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0,001), while no between-group difference was found for QuickDASH (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0,05). No adverse effects were reported for any of the tested interventions. Referred pain in TLH tends to become self-limiting over time, but diaphragmatic breathing exercises resulted in a faster reduction in pain intensity and craniocervical disability when compared with gentle cervical stretching exercises. Thus, abdominodiaphragmatic breathing might be a simple and safe complementary intervention to be taught to patients suffering from referred pain after TLH.",

    "abstract": "Retraining individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis to walk with a patient-specific change in their foot angle (ie, toe-in or toe-out angle) can reduce excessive joint loading related to disease progression. This study investigated the clinical, biomechanical, and structural efficacy of personalised foot progression angle modifications compared with sham treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. In this single-center, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we recruited individuals with symptomatic medial compartment knee osteoarthritis at the Human Performance Laboratory and Lucas Center for Imaging at Stanford University, CA, USA, using online and print media. Eligible participants (aged &#x2265;18 years) were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer to an intervention or sham group. During six walking retraining visits to a university gait laboratory, all participants received real-time biofeedback instructing them to walk consistently with a personalised target foot progression angle. The intervention group's target was the 5&#xb0; or 10&#xb0; change in foot progression angle that maximally reduced their knee loading, and the sham group's target was their natural foot progression angle. Participants and staff involved in data analysis were masked to group allocation; staff performing the gait analysis visits were not. Primary outcomes were 1-year changes in medial knee pain (numeric rating scale) and medial knee loading (knee adduction moment peak). Secondary outcomes were 1-year changes in cartilage microstructure estimated from MRI (T<sub>1&#x3c1;</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times). We evaluated safety by monitoring the number and type of adverse events. Intention-to-treat linear regression analyses, comprising all randomly assigned participants, were conducted. People with lived experience of knee osteoarthritis were involved in the design and conduct of this study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02767570, and is closed to enrollment. Between Aug 1, 2016, and June 25, 2019, 1582 individuals were screened for eligibility. 107 participants completed an initial gait analysis and 68 were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=34) or the sham (n=34) group. 41 (60%) of 68 participants were female, 27 (40%) were male, and 54 (79%) were White; mean age was 64&#xb7;4 years (SD 7&#xb7;6). After 1 year, participants in the intervention group had greater reductions in medial knee pain (between-group difference -1&#xb7;2, 95% CI -1&#xb7;9 to -0&#xb7;5; p=0&#xb7;0013) and knee adduction moment peak (between-group difference -0&#xb7;26 % bodyweight&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;height, 95% CI -0&#xb7;39 to -0&#xb7;13; p=0&#xb7;0001) than participants in the sham group. The MRI-estimated change in cartilage microstructure (T<sub>1&#x3c1;</sub>) in the medial compartment was less in the intervention group than the sham group (between-group difference -3&#xb7;74 ms, 95% CI -6&#xb7;42 to -1&#xb7;05). There were no significant between-group differences in T<sub>2</sub>. There were no severe adverse events; however, two (6%) of 34 participants in the intervention group and one (3%) of 34 participants in the sham group dropped out of the study due to increased knee pain. Personalised foot angle modifications improve pain, reduce knee loading, and might slow osteoarthritis progression, making them a promising non-surgical treatment option for some individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

    "abstract": "Mindfulness meditation (MM) has been shown to effectively alleviate symptoms of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and improve neural functioning. However, it remains unclear whether both online and face-to-face MM can enhance cortical structure, a stable and reliable neural biomarker. This study included 100 IGD patients randomly assigned to three groups: face-to-face MM (31 participants), online MM (38 participants), or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) (31 participants). Pre- and post-assessments were conducted after 8 training sessions. Cortical area, volume, thickness, and local gyrification index (LGI) changes were analyzed using FreeSurfer, with group comparisons and seed-based structural covariance analysis. Both online and face-to-face MM significantly reduced IGD severity. Structural analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in the superior temporal gyrus (face-to-face&#xa0;+&#xa0;online vs. PMR: t&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.725, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014). The face-to-face group also showed significant increases in LGI in the left superior temporal gyrus (t&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.030, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and right insula (t&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.792, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009). All results were correlated with reduced IGD severity. Structural covariance further revealed that MM (face-to-face&#xa0;+&#xa0;online) reduced the covariance between the right superior temporal gyrus and both the default mode and sensory networks. Both online and face-to-face MM reduce IGD severity and enhance cortical structures, such as the superior temporal and the right insula, highlighting potential neuroanatomical targets for IGD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment outcomes can be limited by co-occurring mental and physical conditions, and new adjunctive interventions are needed to improve treatment. Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT) teaches interoceptive awareness skills to promote well-being. This study evaluated the longitudinal effects of MABT as an adjunct to MOUD treatment. Patients stable on MOUD recruited from six community clinics were randomly assigned to MABT+MOUD or MOUD. Five assessments delivered over one year (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;303) examined abstinence from non-prescribed opioid and overall substance use (primary outcomes), and secondary outcomes of mental and physical health distress, interoceptive and mindfulness skills, and opioid craving. An intent-to-treat approach to examine change across time involved generalized estimating equations and linear mixed multilevel models. This sample demonstrated high percent days abstinence from non-prescribed opioids and other substances, resulting in no statistical between-group differences over time. Significant overall longitudinal effects for MABT+MOUD vs. MOUD were evident on secondary outcomes of physical symptom frequency, and interoceptive awareness. In addition, significant baseline to 12 month between-group improvements were evident on PTSD symptoms, emotion regulation difficulties, and mindfulness skills. While stable on MOUD, this sample had high levels of chronic pain and mental health distress. The results highlight improved longitudinal health outcomes in response to MABT critical to support recovery on MOUD. The MABT completion rate and maintained use of MABT skills over 12 months demonstrates MABT implementation feasibility and positive intervention response as an adjunct to MOUD treatment.

An increasing body of interest has recently focused on the Nutri-Score label; therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to assess its effectiveness in enhancing nutrition literacy, consumers' food choices, adherence to healthy patterns, and health status. Results reveal most studies are conducted in experimental settings with no evidence of nutrition literacy impact and nonsignificant or little effect sizes on eating patterns and health status improvement, particularly in real-life studies. Despite its underpinning algorithm being strongly associated with mortality risk, differences promoted by NutriScore in shopping basket nutrient composition appear limited to saturated fats and sodium with very small effect sizes; moreover, C, D, and E categories seem ineffective in changing consumers' purchases. These findings suggest that expectations for Nutri-Score might be scaled down and require careful consideration for future development in this area.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in decision-making is found in several mental disorders, including anorexia nervosa, addiction, mood disorders, and suicidal behavior. Improving decision-making is a relevant therapeutic objective to reduce vulnerability and risky behaviors. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a simple and non-invasive technique that allows for the stimulation of a cortical area of interest. Previous studies have shown that tDCS of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in healthy volunteers improves decision-making in the short-term. We aimed to demonstrate this short-term effect in patients with a mood disorder. This was a prospective, single-center, interventional, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrial.govNCT06110559) with two parallel arms (active vs sham stimulation) in a single-blind design. tDCS was applied during 30&#xa0;min over the left OFC (anode Fp1/cathode Fp2). The primary outcome was a change in the net score on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) measured immediately before and after stimulation. Sixty-two patients were randomized to receive active (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) or sham (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) stimulation. We observed a significant improvement in IGT net score in the active vs sham arm (time*arm interaction &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.10; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.043). No significant change at other cognitive tasks (d2, Go/No-Go, Emotional Stroop) or self-rating perceived emotion questionnaires (PANAS, STAI-Y-A) was found. Patients did not correctly guess the treatment arm. These preliminary findings support the use of tDCS over the OFC to improve decision-making in patients with mood disorders. Future studies should assess the best strategies for sustained improvement, and the naturalistic consequences in terms of real-life decision-making and functioning.",

    "title": "Associations between HEXACO personality traits, substance use disorders, and behavioral addictions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This study presents the first systematic review and meta-analysis examining the associations between the HEXACO personality traits, substance use disorders (SUDs), and behavioral addictions. A comprehensive search was conducted on the databases APA PsycINFO (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), ProQuest, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Wiley Online Library, with a supplementary search on Google Scholar. Studies were included if they were empirical, published in peer-reviewed journals or as dissertations, investigated the association between HEXACO personality traits, SUDs, and behavioral addictions, and reported zero-order correlations or sufficient data for such calculations. Case studies and qualitative studies were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes for behavioral addictions. For SUD analyses, fixed effects model was applied as only two studies were available per trait. Nineteen studies with a total of 9,478 participants were included. Meta-analytic results showed statistically significant inverse associations between behavioral addictions and honesty-humility (-0.339, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.433, -0.237), extraversion (-0.197, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.321, -0.066), agreeableness (-0.336, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.478, -0.177), conscientiousness (-0.317, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.410, -0.218), and openness to experience (-0.201, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.322, -0.073), while emotionality showed a statistically significant positive association (0.212, 95&#xa0;% CI = 0.094, 0.324). For SUDs, analyses demonstrated statistically significant inverse associations with honesty-humility (-0.226, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.298, -0.150) and conscientiousness (-0.157, 95&#xa0;% CI = -0.232, -0.081), while other traits showed non-significant associations. Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies. Meta-regressions showed that gender and age moderated the relationship between agreeableness and behavioral addictions, while gender also moderated the relationship between extraversion and behavioral addictions. This meta-analysis provides strong empirical evidence for an association between HEXACO personality traits and addictions. The findings suggest that incorporating HEXACO trait assessments may be beneficial in planning and targeting interventions for individuals with addictions, but that the population in question also should be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Policies restricting price-based incentives in the out-of-home (OOH) food sector could influence food-related behaviours and improve population diet. In the present study we assessed the impact of removing price-based incentives on consumer food selection through a virtual, hypothetical, OOH delivery platform. Participants ordered a hypothetical meal for their household using a virtual ordering platform which presented the menu of a popular UK pizza chain restaurant/takeaway outlet. Participants were randomly allocated to one of 5 experimental conditions: control (all price-based incentives present), price reductions removed (e.g., 25&#xa0;% off when you spend &#xa3;10), value pricing removed (product size increase for a disproportionately small price increase), bulk-buy reductions removed (meal deals at discounted prices), and all price-based incentives removed. We examined the impact of removing each of the price-based incentives individually and simultaneously on hypothetical food purchases (energy selected (kcal) and money spent). There was a main effect of price-based incentive experimental condition on energy selected (F(4, 1919)&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.51, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.007) and money spent (F(4,1919)&#xa0;=&#xa0;163.48, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001) and there was no evidence that effects of removing price-based incentives differed by participant characteristics. Participants in the control condition had a significantly lower hypothetical spend than all other conditions. Kcal selected tended to be lower in the all price-based incentives removed condition compared to the control condition (-7&#xa0;%) and other conditions (average -8&#xa0;%), although only the difference between all price-based incentives removed and value pricing removed conditions reached pre-specified statistical significance (-364&#xa0;kcal; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.0125; d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.21). Bayes Factors indicated that for all other pairwise comparisons the data did not provide strong evidence to support either the presence or absence of an effect. Therefore, further research is necessary to assess the impact of removing price-based incentives in OOH food settings.",

    "title": "Systematic review of patient safety incident reporting practices in maternity care.",
    "abstract": "Patient safety incident reporting in maternity care is central for improving safety, yet inconsistencies in reporting practices and limited understanding of system functionalities may reduce its effectiveness. Reporting incidents allows healthcare providers to identify safety issues and implement improvements. However, variations in reporting practices, particularly in maternity care, have been found across different healthcare settings. Despite the growing use of electronic systems, challenges such as under-reporting, lack of feedback and insufficient organisational learning persist. This review explores how patient safety incidents are reported in maternity care, identifies the systems used globally, examines potential barriers and enablers to reporting, and highlights gaps in existing research and practice. A systematic review was conducted, analysing studies that focused on incident reporting practices in maternity care. An artificial intelligence text analysis tool (Caplena) was used to aid the synthesis of the study data. Methodologies included quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews and mixed methods approaches. A total of 15 studies from seven different countries were analysed. Reporting systems ranged from traditional paper-based methods to electronic platforms. Barriers included organisational culture, time pressures and inadequate reporting platforms. Enablers involved supportive leadership, training and user-friendly reporting systems. Substantial gaps included the under-reporting of near misses, lack of feedback mechanisms and insufficient attention to staff experiences. The findings highlight the need for consistent, user-friendly reporting systems and fostering a supportive, non-punitive culture. Strengthening and improving feedback mechanisms is also critical to enhance reporting practices. Recommendations are provided for designing future reporting systems. Improving patient safety incident reporting in maternity care requires system improvements, cultural changes and further research to address identified gaps and optimise incident management systems.",

    "abstract": "Attentional bias (AB), characterized by a disproportionate allocation of attention toward threat-related stimuli, constitutes a well-established cognitive mechanism underlying anxiety disorders. As a targeted intervention, attentional bias modification (ABM) has garnered substantial empirical support for its efficacy in attenuating AB and ameliorating anxiety symptomatology. This study evaluated and compared the effectiveness of three major ABM training paradigms in reducing attentional bias manifestations: dot-probe task-based ABM (DPT-ABM), emotional spatial cueing task-based ABM (ESCT-ABM), and visual search task-based ABM (VST-ABM). Using the attention to negative inventory (ANI) scale, we screened 202 non-clinical adolescents exhibiting elevated levels of negative attentional bias (NAB) and randomly assigned them to either an active modification group (DPT-ABM, ESCT-ABM, or VST-ABM) or a matched control group (DPT-C, ESCT-C, or VST-C). Participants underwent eight offline training sessions across a four-week period. Attentional bias scores (ABS), learning anxiety, and sense of agency (SoA) were assessed at pre-test and post-test intervals. Additionally, a three-month follow-up evaluation was conducted to examine long-term changes in ABS. The results showed that VST-ABM led to significant and sustained reductions in ABS compared to its control group, while other paradigms did not produce such effects. This study provides new evidence that active search training for positive emotional stimuli in VST-ABM is more effective than passive avoidance training of negative stimuli in reducing negative attentional bias and improving emotional well-being in non-clinical adolescents.",

Leveraging data from a randomized controlled trial involving 6,974 households across 143 health facilities, the study explores how financial incentives for healthcare providers influence their family-planning behaviors. The findings reveal that SS-CCTs significantly improve contraceptive knowledge and uptake, particularly among educated women. Factors such as age, household income, urban residence, and proximity to health facilities are pivotal in shaping these outcomes. Women with no formal education increasingly utilized contraceptives but gained limited knowledge. The results highlight the critical role of education in amplifying the effectiveness of health interventions and call for policies that address socioeconomic disparities. By aligning interventions with household needs, these strategies can enhance reproductive health outcomes and promote broader household welfare.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease affects 1 in 7 people in the US, and 1 in 6 US Veterans. Treatment for kidney failure includes home dialysis, which, despite its benefits, is infrequently used. A major barrier to using home dialysis is receiving adequate education about it. This research investigates how patient education affects treatment choices of Veterans with kidney disease. As part of a randomized control trial, we interviewed 42 US Veterans with advanced chronic kidney disease. An interview based on the Theoretical Domains Framework elicited on the impact of study education on decision-making. Reflexive thematic analysis attuned to cultural model theory-the beliefs which motivate behavior held by groups-was used for analysis. There were four themes in the data: 1) Pre-education, patients had a lack of knowledge of kidney disease and treatment. 2) After education, patients reacted with surprise and then coping actions. 3) Patients experienced positive emotions and beliefs from education and coping. 4) Patients dealt with diagnosis and engaged in treatment decision-making. Ten cognitive, emotional, and behavioral subthemes were seen. Themes were found in the interviews of 76&#x202f;% of participants receiving comprehensive patient education, but only 27&#x202f;% of those receiving enhanced usual care. We provide a mechanistic understanding of the process through which education affects cultural models to support patients' decision-making by preparing and equipping them to confront the future. We note that cultural model changes occur across longitudinal stages, which are recursive with one another and dynamic based on the individual case. Because optimal dialysis outcomes require time to plan, create, and heal from dialysis access surgery, practitioners should provide patient education 6 months prior to estimated start to account for time needed for cultural model change. Helping patients know what to expect in terms of their own changing understanding may further support.",

Helping patients clarify their preferences and values may improve shared decision making (SDM). Understand how summary reports impact patient and clinician behaviors for values-based discussions and SDM related to healthcare decisions. Searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL, with a supplemental search in Connected Papers. Studies presenting summary reports based on self-reported data from patients with chronic conditions and assessing SDM or decisional conflict as it relates to SDM. We extracted data formats, utilization practices, communication characteristics, communication functions, and study outcomes to evaluate summary reports. Communication characteristics and functions were categorized using Hawkins' \"tailoring in health communication framework\" and the Online Health Information Tools (OHIT) framework, respectively. We identified four themes regarding the intent of summary reports. No studies reported using electronic health records for self-reports or summary reports. All studies (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;21) used at least one communication characteristic from Hawkins' framework, and 90&#x202f;% (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;19/21) used one or more functions from the OHIT, with variability among specific characteristics and functions.

Decisional conflict was lowered in 67&#x202f;% (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;8/12) of studies. Themes from this systematic review suggest that when summary reports were developed to enhance information exchange, or when patients and clinicians actively discussed values during consultations, SDM often improved. We revealed a gap in understanding how tailoring summary reports can prepare and encourage patients to discuss their values and engage in SDM, specifically when clinicians do not initiate a values-based discussion.

While all RCT participants received cash-aid food vouchers, they were randomised to the following additional treatment arms: i) informational intervention about the benefits of healthy eating; ii) \"affective\" nudges reminding facts about healthy food, or iii) additional cash-aids. We use food purchasing data from all these participants who were also beneficiaries in 2023 of cash-aid food vouchers. We find a positive impact of all interventions aggregated in the three standard indexes of food purchasing quality. Examining intervention heterogeneity, we find that informational interventions and affective nudge messages were more effective than cash incentives in leading to healthier food choices. They improved the nutritional content, overall purchases and the quality of purchases made by the treated groups by 9.06&#xa0;%, 3.29&#xa0;% and 8.43&#xa0;% of the average value for the control group during the pre-treatment period.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review examined the prevalence of postpartum family planning (PPFP) uptake and its association with spousal discussion and husband's support. Systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed (NLM), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate) and Cochrane Library (Wiley). The review included primary observational studies published in English between January 2014 and March 2024. Eligible studies reported prevalence and association between spousal discussion, support, approval or contraceptive use by the husband in PPFP within 12 months of childbirth. Two reviewers independently screened the articles, performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated pooled prevalence, and pooled ORs of log odds were reported for the association between spousal discussion and partner approval and PPFP uptake. Six cross-sectional studies involving 2856 postpartum women were included. The pooled prevalence of PPFP uptake was 35% (95% CI 19% to 52%). Meta-analysis showed that spousal discussion was associated with PPFP uptake (log OR=1.39 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.13), however, partner's approval was not associated with PPFP uptake (log OR=1.49, 95%&#x2009;CI -0.08 to 3.06). Two studies assessed partner support, with one reporting a significant association (log OR: 1.45); joint decision-making was assessed in two studies but showed no significant association with PPFP. In conclusion, the overall prevalence of PPFP uptake is low. Spousal discussion plays a critical role in enhancing PPFP uptake. These findings highlight the need for policy initiatives and programmatic interventions that promote couple communication for PPFP decision-making to improve reproductive health outcomes in low-middle-income countries.

    "abstract": "Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) often exhibit heightened delay discounting, a behavioral marker associated with poor treatment outcomes. Medications such as naltrexone and varenicline influence reward-related decision-making, but their effects on delay discounting remain unclear. This study examined whether these medications influence delay discounting rates. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 34 treatment-seeking adults with AUD. Participants were assigned to naltrexone (50&#xa0;mg/day), varenicline (2&#xa0;mg/day), or placebo and completed a two-week medication titration followed by a six-day quit attempt. Delay discounting was assessed at baseline and post-treatment using the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). General linear models tested medication effects on post-treatment discounting, controlling for baseline discounting, education, and income. A significant interaction between medication and baseline delay discounting emerged (P&#xa0;=&#x2009;.03; &#x3b7;2&#xa0;=&#x2009;.67). Among participants with lower baseline discounting, naltrexone reduced delay discounting compared to placebo and varenicline. However, no significant effects were observed in participants with higher baseline discounting. Varenicline did not significantly alter delay discounting compared to placebo. These findings suggest that naltrexone may reduce delay discounting in individuals with AUD, but primarily among those with lower discounting rates. The results highlight the importance of baseline traits in understanding medication effects on decision-making. Given the small sample size, future research should replicate these findings in larger trials and explore whether delay discounting could serve as a biomarker for personalized AUD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Shared decision-making is a decision-making process that involves both patients and their healthcare providers and can serve as a framework to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, thereby helping to control antibiotic resistance. However, little is known about the factors that influence the adoption of shared decision-making for antibiotic prescription in developing countries. The objective of this review is to identify factors influencing the adoption of shared decision-making for antibiotic prescription from both physicians' and patients' perspectives in developing countries. We searched four electronic databases, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and ProQuest Health and Medicine, from 3 July 2023 to August 20, 2023. Studies were included if they assessed factors influencing the practice of shared decision-making during antibiotics prescription from physicians' or patients' perspectives in developing countries. The included studies were published in English and used quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method designs, spanning 2010 and 2023. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) version 2018, and data extraction from selected articles was performed by the first author and co-authors. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesis the qualitative result and incorporate quantitative data. Initially, a total of 2120 studies were identified. After evaluating the inclusion criteria, 24 were included in the final analysis. The main factors that influence the adoption of shared decision-making (SDM) in developing countries are time constraints, misunderstanding of shared decision-making, cultural and socioeconomic influence, power dynamics differences (hierarchical relationship between physicians and patients), patients' preference and agreement with shared decision-making, and availability of resources. Additionally, the quality of the relationship between patients and physicians plays a key role in influencing the practice of shared decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of interventions aimed at both physicians and patients, such as education and training programs focused on shared decision-making for antibiotic prescription. However, further study is required to develop effective strategies that promote the adoption of shared decision-making practices while considering the contextual factors at play.",

    "abstract": "Living with dementia requires decision making about numerous topics including daily activities and advance care planning (ACP). Both individuals living with dementia and care partners require informed support for decision making. We conducted an umbrella review to assess knowledge translation (KT) interventions supporting decision making for individuals living with dementia and their informal care partners. Four databases were searched using 50 different search terms, identifying 22 reviews presenting 32 KT interventions. The most common KT decision topic was ACP (N = 21) which includes advanced care directives, feeding options, and placement in long-term care. The majority of KT interventions targeted care partners only (N = 16), or both care partners and individuals living with dementia (N = 13), with fewer interventions (N = 3) targeting individuals living with dementia. Overall, our umbrella review offers insights into the beneficial impacts of KT interventions, such as increased knowledge and confidence, and decreased decisional conflicts. HIGHLIGHTS: Knowledge translation (KT) helps people with dementia and caregivers make decisions. Our umbrella review investigated whether KT interventions helped decision making. KT interventions were beneficial, with advance care planning being the main topic. Thirteen (41%) of the 32 KT interventions were found to be freely accessible online. We recommend the creation of a KT toolkit to guide topic-specific decision making.",

    "title": "People Strongly Value Physical Therapies for Low Back Pain Over Doing Nothing, Even When Effects Are Very Small: A Discrete Choice Experiment.",
    "abstract": "<b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To explore factors that influence patient preferences for recommended physical therapies for low back pain. <b>DESIGN:</b> Discrete choice experiment. <b>METHODS:</b> Respondents were randomized to a block of 12 choice tasks and asked to choose between two physical therapies or no treatment. Characteristics of the physical therapies varied between choice tasks and included type (exercise, advice and education, or clinician-directed treatment), effectiveness, time for symptoms to improve, costs, risk of side effects, and treatment duration. Choices were analyzed using a mixed logit model. Latent class analysis examined preference heterogeneity. To measure decision trade-offs, we estimated the smallest worthwhile effect and the \"willingness to pay\" value. <b>RESULTS:</b> A total of 697 Australians reporting a history of low back in the last year completed all choice tasks. Respondents showed a strong preference for taking any nonpharmacologic care option over no treatment (<i>OR</i> = 17.24; 95% CI [12.89, 22.58]). This preference was present at any level of effectiveness (smallest worthwhile effect = 0%). Respondents preferred physical therapies with higher effectiveness, quicker symptom improvement, lower out-of-pocket expenses, reduced side effects, and shorter duration. Respondents were willing to pay up to A$355 per month for physical therapies over no treatment. Older and less-educated respondents had weaker preferences for physical therapies. <b>CONCLUSION:</b> Respondents had a strong preference for any recommended physical therapies over no treatment for low back pain, even when effects were very small. Clinicians should discuss likely effectiveness, time for improvement, side effects, and treatment duration when supporting patients to choose between recommended physical therapies. <i>J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2025;55(9):602-610.

    "abstract": "Preventing harm to others is a foundational principle of human morality that relies on distinct learning processes when avoiding harm to others versus oneself. Using a behavioral neuroendocrinology perspective, we investigated the effects of a single dose of testosterone administration on harm-avoidance learning. 120 healthy men randomly received either testosterone or placebo. Three hours later, participants completed a harm-avoidance task, learning over time to choose the option with a lower probability of electric shock to avoid harm either for themselves (Self condition) or for a stranger (Other condition). Behavioral analyses revealed that testosterone administration prolonged recipient differences across trials compared to placebo. Computational modeling quantified these recipient differences which were likely caused by testosterone administration. A reinforcement learning model with dual learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors (PEs) best accounted for individuals' choices. Analysis showed that, compared to placebo, testosterone enhanced learning from negative outcomes but suppressed learning from positive outcomes in the Self condition, without affecting learning rates in the Other condition. Additionally, testosterone administration slowed prosocial learning from negative outcomes compared to placebo and reversed its positive relationship with trait anxiety. Collectively, our findings offer precise computational insights into the role of testosterone administration in harm-avoidance learning. The results indicate that testosterone influences harm-avoidance learning, potentially in a self-protective and strategic prosocial manner. This study aims to enhance the comprehensive understanding of hormonal effects.",

    "title": "Impact of recruitment method on informed decision-making in lung cancer screening in the 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN trial.",
    "abstract": "It is relatively unknown how to inform individuals about lung cancer screening to enable informed decision-making (IDM). This study aims to determine the level of IDM across different recruitment methods among participants invited for the 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN trial, the European implementation trial for lung cancer screening. A 23-item online questionnaire related to decision-relevant knowledge was sent to 848 Dutch men and women, aged 60-79&#xa0;years, who were randomised in 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN. Respondents were considered to have sufficient knowledge when answering at least 12 items correctly. Informed choice was determined as 1) having sufficient knowledge and 2) consistency between intention to be screened and actual participation. Participants were recruited between July 2024 and August 2024. Of 386 respondents (45.5&#xa0;%) with fully completed questionnaires, 327 (84.7&#xa0;%) had sufficient knowledge and made an informed decision, 283 (85.2&#xa0;%) of the screened participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;332) did so. Knowledge scores increased with the level of tailoring as compared to standard paper information (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015). While 78.1&#xa0;% from the standard paper group made an informed choice, 89.0&#xa0;% from the tailored group did so (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.088). IDM was comparable among the socioeconomic status (SES) groups: 79.8&#xa0;% (95/119) of the participants in the lower, 84.5&#xa0;% (93/110) in the middle, and 88.5&#xa0;% (139/157) in the high SES group made an informed decision (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.138). No sex-related differences were found in informed decision-making: 196 out of 231 males (84.8&#xa0;%) versus 131 out of 155 females (84.5&#xa0;%), p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.929. Even if assumed that all responders with incomplete questionnaires did have insufficient knowledge, 69.6&#xa0;% were able to make an informed decision. The manner in which participants are informed contributes to the extent to which they can make an informed decision. A more tailored approach leads to improved knowledge, which facilitates IDM. The results indicate an equivalent level of IDM across different SES and sex groups.",

    "abstract": "This study employs a meta-analysis methodology to examine the impacts of human capital and farmers' risk preferences on their decisions regarding sustainable farming practices. By analyzing 143 peer-reviewed studies, we provide valuable insights for policymakers and environmental activists aiming to promote sustainable agriculture worldwide. Our findings confirm that education, experience and agricultural extension in form of human capital play the significant role in fostering the adoption of sustainable farming practices. Moreover, we find that farmers' attitudes toward risk significantly influence their decision-making, as higher risk aversion reduces their willingness to adopt sustainable practices, inversely, risk loving stimulates their sustainable practices adoption.",

    "abstract": "Current risk-stratification systems for prostate cancer (PCa) do not sufficiently reflect the disease heterogeneity, and digital pathology (DP) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) tools (DP-AI) may offer a solution to this challenge. The aim of this work is to summarize the role of DP-AI for PCa patients treated with radiotherapy (RT), and to point out future areas of research. We conducted (1) a systematic review on the evidence of DP-AI for patients treated with RT and (2) a survey of experts using a modified Delphi method, addressing the current role of DP-AI in clinical and research practice to identify relevant fields of future development. Eleven studies investigated DP-AI in PCa RT, with most using the multimodal AI (MMAI) classifier and four ongoing studies are currently prospectively testing the DP-AI performance. DP-AI showed strong prognostic and predictive performance for endpoints like distant metastasis free survival and overall survival, outperforming traditional risk models and assisting treatment decisions such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) duration. Fifty-one and 35 experts responded to round 1 and round 2 of the survey respectively. Questions with &#x2265;75&#xa0;% agreement were considered relevant and included in the qualitative analysis. Survey results confirmed growing adoption of DP scanners, although regional differences in re-imbursement mechanisms and availability persist, with experts endorsing DP-AI's potential across localized, postoperative, and metastatic settings, though further prospective validation is needed. DP-AI tools show strong prognostic and predictive potential in various PCa by guiding patient stratification and optimising ADT duration in primary RT. Prospective studies and validation in cohorts using modern diagnostic and treatment methods are needed before broad clinical adoption.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments on Preferences for COVID-19 Vaccinations.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced vaccination strategies and public health policies. Discrete choice experiments have emerged as a valuable tool for understanding preferences regarding vaccination. This study systematically reviews discrete choice experiments conducted on COVID-19 public vaccination preferences to identify key determinants influencing vaccine uptake and to assess methodological approaches used in these studies. A systematic literature search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify discrete choice experiments focusing on COVID-19 vaccination preferences up to 31 December, 2024. Attribute categorization into five dimensions Outcome, Process, Cost, Trust, and Framing was performed and quality appraised according to the DIRECT checklist. Conditional relative importance as well as geographical differences were assessed. The review identified 58 studies employing discrete choice experiments that assessed public COVID-19 vaccine preferences. Among attribute categories, outcome-related factors were the most frequently used and had the highest relative importance. Other commonly evaluated attributes included cost, origin/brand, and required doses. A notable geographic disparity was observed, with studies being unevenly distributed across different regions. Methodological heterogeneity was observed in attribute selection and experimental design. This review emphasizes the importance of considering individual preferences into vaccination strategies to enhance uptake, particularly in preparation for future pandemics. The findings reveal that vaccine effectiveness and safety are key concerns for individuals. Future research could focus on increasing representation of underexamined regions in preference studies to better inform local policymakers in developing effective vaccination programs for future health crises. This review was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) with the ID CRD42025543234.",

    "title": "Human-Centric explanations for users in automated Vehicles: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "The decision-making processes of automated vehicles (AVs) can confuse users and reduce trust, highlighting the need for clear and human-centric explanations. Such explanations can help users understand AV actions, facilitate smooth control transitions and enhance transparency, acceptance, and trust. Critically, such explanations could improve situational awareness and support timely, appropriate human responses, thereby reducing the risk of misuse, unexpected automated decisions, and delayed reactions in safety-critical scenarios. However, current literature offers limited insight into how different types of explanations impact drivers in diverse scenarios and the methods for evaluating their quality. This paper systematically reviews what, when and how to provide human-centric explanations in AV contexts. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, and covered five databases-Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, TRID, and Semantic Scholar-from 2000 to April 2024. Out of 266 identified articles, 59 met the inclusion criteria. Providing a detailed content explanation following AV's driving actions in real time does not always increase user trust and acceptance. Explanations that clarify the reasoning behind actions are more effective than those merely describing actions. Providing explanations before action is recommended, though the optimal timing remains uncertain. Multimodal explanations (visual and audio) are most effective when each mode conveys unique information; otherwise, visual-only explanations are preferred. The narrative perspective (first-person vs. third-person) also impacts user trust differently across scenarios. The review underscores the importance of tailoring human-centric explanations to specific driving contexts. Future research should address explanation length, timing, and modality coordination and focus on real-world studies to enhance generalisability. These insights are vital for advancing the research of human-centric explanations in AV systems and fostering safer, more trustworthy human-vehicle interactions, ultimately reducing the risk of inappropriate reactions, delayed responses, or user error in traffic settings.",

    "abstract": "Surgery-related adverse events are among the most common adverse events in-hospital. However, no comprehensive, multidisciplinary perioperative guidelines exist at the European level. The aim of this study is to describe the process and results in achieving European multidisciplinary consensus on perioperative patient safety recommendations. This multimethod study included: (1) a systematic review of guidelines; (2) selection and synthesis of recommendations; and (3) a two-round modified Delphi technique including a 2-day face-to-face consensus conference. We recruited a panel of two expert groups balanced in terms of gender, geographical origin, and professional background, with meaningful participation from patient representatives. Consensus was defined as at least 70% of the panel rating a recommendation 7-9 on a 9-point Likert scale for importance to patient safety and feasibility of implementation. The systematic review included 267 guidelines, from which 4666 patient safety recommendations were identified and extracted. After four synthesis rounds, 99 recommendations were presented for the Delphi survey, detailing their strength of recommendation, level of evidence, and methodological quality of the cited guidelines. An expert group, composed of 66 multidisciplinary experts from 19 European countries, participated with a response rate of 80.3%. After the two Delphi rounds and the consensus conference, the panel agreed on a final set of 101 recommended perioperative patient safety practices. A set of 101 comprehensive, evidence-based, patient-centred perioperative patient safety practices was developed through a European consensus process to improve the quality of care in healthcare facilities across Europe and beyond.",

Peer-reviewed, empirical studies reporting on the considerations regarding healthcare choices of older people (aged &#x2265; 75) with multimorbidity in English were included. The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research was used to appraise included studies. 20 articles relating to 19 studies with a total of 225 participants were included. Studies were mainly based on interviews (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;12) or combined observational and interview data (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;7) and reported on multiple types of healthcare choices. The synthesis showed a variety of patient considerations regarding engagement with decision-making delineating a spectrum of engagement and a diversity of drivers for healthcare choices. Contextual factors such as complexity, power dynamics, information provision, and relationships shaped patients' considerations. The synthesis showed that considerations of older people with multimorbidity are diverse and considerably shaped by patient and decision context. Therefore, this context should be considered in decision-making, with specific attention to vulnerability to power dynamics, and room should be provided to attune decision-making to individual patient considerations. Interventions to improve integration of patient considerations in decision-making and patient engagement should not only focus on patients, but also target healthcare professionals and systems.",

    "title": "Benefits of acute aerobic exercise to ameliorate craving and risky decision-making in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the acute effects of aerobic exercise on craving and risky decision-making in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Using a cross-over design, thirty male participants with MUD were recruited and completed a 30-minute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise task (75&#x2009;%-80&#x2009;% HRmax) and a sedentary control task in a randomized order. HR, RPE, and craving were measured before, during, and after each task. After the exercise task, risky decision-making was assessed using three cognitive tasks administered in a randomized order: the Delay Discounting Task (DDT, measuring impulsive decision-making), the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT, assessing myopic decision-making), and the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART, evaluating risk-taking behavior). Three experimental paradigms can observe the change of MUD decision-making from three different dimensions, so as to further observe the effect of aerobic exercise on MUD decision-making function. Aerobic exercise significantly reduced craving compared to the sedentary task, with the greatest reductions observed during and immediately following exercise (all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Post-exercise, participants demonstrated improved decision-making performance, as evidenced by an increased area under the curve (AUC) in the DDT (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, Cohen's d=0.49, 95&#x2009;% CI [0.32,0.69]) and higher net scores in the IGT (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, Cohen's d=0.52, 95&#x2009;% CI [0.10,0.49]). However, no significant changes were found in BART scores or success rates between the two conditions. Acute aerobic exercise effectively reduces craving and enhances decision-making performance, particularly in the domains of impulsive and myopic decision-making, in individuals with MUD. However, no significant effect was observed on risk-taking behavior. These findings suggest that aerobic exercise may serve as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for reducing craving and improving decision-making, potentially lowering recurrence risk in MUD patients. Furthermore, this study has limitations in the correlation between a single experiment and long-term benefits and gender.",

This randomized controlled study was carried out to determine the effects of motivational interviews based on the information-motivation-behavioral skills model, health education, and hippotherapy on digital game addiction in adolescents. The study was performed at two public middle schools in Turkey between December 2021 and April 2024. Sixty-two students whose Digital Game Addiction Scale scores were 73 or higher were randomly divided into the experimental (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) and control (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30) groups. The experimental group was given digital game addiction education, model-based individual motivational interviews (6 sessions) and simultaneous hippotherapy (6 sessions). Data were collected using the Digital Game Addiction Scale for Children, the Awareness of Digital Game Addiction Scale, the Digital Game-Playing Motivation Scale, the Digital Gaming Attitude Scale, the Survey of Children's Social Support, and the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children. The data were analyzed using the R version 2.15.3 program. The experimental group had significantly lower Digital Game Addiction Scale for Children scores than the control group (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). While the Digital Game Addiction Scale for Children scores of the experimental group increased (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05), these scores of the control group did not significantly change (p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.05). The digital game-playing motivations and digital gaming attitudes scores of the participants were low.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer screening is considered an effective early detection strategy. Artificial intelligence (AI) may both offer benefits and create risks for breast screening programmes. To use AI in health screening services, the views and expectations of consumers are critical. This study examined the preferences of Australian women regarding AI use in breast cancer screening and the impact of information on preferences using discrete choice experiments. The experiment presented two alternative screening services based on seven attributes (reading method, screening sensitivity, screening specificity, time between screening and receiving results, supporting evidence, fair representation, and who should be held accountable) to 2063 women aged between 40 and 74 years recruited from an online panel. Participants were randomised into two arms. Both received standard information on AI use in breast screening, but one arm received additional information on its potential benefits. Preferences for hypothetical breast cancer screening services were modelled using a random parameter logit model. Relative attribute importance and uptake rates were estimated. Participants preferred mixed reading (radiologist + AI system) over the other two reading methods. They showed a strong preference for fewer missed cases with a high attribute relative importance. Fewer false positives and a shorter waiting time for results were also preferred. Strength of preferences for mixed reading was significantly higher compared to two radiologists when additional information on AI is provided, highlighting the impact of information. This study revealed the preferences among Australian women for the use of AI-driven breast cancer screening services. Results generally suggest women are open to their mammograms being read by both a radiologist and an AI-based system under certain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Self-reported medication adherence may be influenced by socially desirable answers and untruthful reporting. Misreporting of adherence behavior can bias estimations of treatment (cost)effectiveness. This study investigated how to induce truthful self-reported medication adherence and evaluated how self-reported (truth-induced vs. regularly reported) medication adherence and treatment preferences were associated. Medication adherence was measured after a discrete choice experiment eliciting stated preferences for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-treatments. Data was collected among MS-patients in three Western countries. Half of the sample was randomized to 'choice-matching', a novel mechanism which induces truthfulness. It financially compensates respondents based on their self-reported adherence and guesses about other respondents' adherence. To investigate the impact of truth-incentivized adherence reporting on preference heterogeneity, interaction effects between medication adherence and treatment preferences were tested separately within the choice-matching and the 'standard' group. The sample comprised 380 MS-patients (mean age 41y, 69% female). Respondents in the choice-matching group reported a lower medication adherence compared to the standard group (always adherent: 39.3% vs. 46.6%). Mixed logit models showed significant interaction effects: in the choice-matching group, higher medication adherence resulted in lower utility for pills twice/day compared to injections three times/week (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019), while in the standard group, respondents with higher medication adherence preferred pills once/day compared to injections three times/week (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Choice-matching likely encouraged respondents to report their true medication adherence. Linking truthful behavior to patients' preferences allows for a better understanding of preference heterogeneity and helping to make decisions that fit patients' true preferences.",

    "abstract": "Primary care providers (PCPs) prescribe less often treatments for smoking cessation than for other major risk factors. We assessed the effect of training PCPs to offer smoking cessation treatments to current smokers as the default choice using an encounter decision aid (DA) on smoking cessation. Pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial with PCPs in private practice in Switzerland and France. The intervention was a half-day course teaching PCPs the default choice approach using a DA. Control PCPs received a 1-h refresher training on smoking cessation aids. PCPs recruited daily smokers seen for routine care. The primary outcome was self-reported, 7-day, point prevalence smoking abstinence at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were quit attempts and use of smoking cessation aids at 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, and a patient-reported measure of shared decision-making (CollaboRATE scale 1-10, higher scores = more involvement). Forty-two PCPs completed the training (76% Swiss) and recruited 287 current smokers (105 intervention group, 182 control group), with 51% women, mean age 48 (SD, 2.6), 77% who smoked &lt;20 cigarettes/day, and 221 who responded at 6 months follow-up (77%). The intervention did not affect self-reported smoking abstinence rate at 6 months (9.5% intervention and 10.4% control groups, respectively; OR 0.88 (95%CI 0.37-2.10). It did however increase the number of quit attempts at 3 weeks (OR 2.09, 95%CI 1.04-4.20) and the use of smoking cessation aids at the 3-week and 3-month follow-ups (OR 2.57, 95%CI 1.21-5.45 and OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.11-3.60, respectively). The mean CollaboRATE score was 8.05/10 in the intervention group and 7.28/10 in the control group (p=0.02), reflecting more patient involvement in decision-making. Training PCPs to use a decision aid did not improve smoking abstinence rate, despite short-term increases in quit attempts and use of smoking cessation aids.

    "title": "Feasibility of a Study Within a Trial to evaluate a decision support intervention for families deciding about research on behalf of adults lacking capacity to consent (CONSULT SWAT).",
    "abstract": "Trials involving adults who lack capacity to consent can be challenging, partly due to the involvement of 'proxy' decision-makers. This is usually a family member, who advises the researchers about the person's wishes. Families can find decision making difficult and some experience a decisional burden. Following the development of a decision aid for family members making trial participation decisions, we are conducting a mixed-methods randomised Study Within a Trial (SWAT) to evaluate its (cost-)effectiveness. This paper reports the feasibility stage conducted in one host study to inform delivery of the main SWAT. Family members approached to act as a consultee for the host study were randomised 1:1 to receive the decision aid booklet alongside standard study information (intervention), or standard information plus a blank notebook (control), and asked to complete the CONCORD scale (Combined Scale for Proxy Informed Consent Decisions) questions about their experience and take part in a semi-structured interview. Acceptability of the SWAT was assessed through exploring recruitment rates and data completeness, and qualitatively through interviews with family members and research staff. Interviews were analysed using a rapid qualitative approach. In total, 92 family members were randomised to the SWAT and 16 completed the CONCORD questionnaire. Interviews were conducted with consultees (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), and host study staff (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3) who also provided resource use data. Differences in time staff spent with consultees were small. Key themes included (1) setting up the SWAT and balancing priorities with the host study, (2) differences when recruiting consultees to a SWAT, (3) feasibility and acceptability of the SWAT, (4) challenges of measuring decision quality and (5) views and experiences of the decision support intervention. The CONSULT SWAT is feasible, but changes to study processes are needed in advance of the main SWAT. The findings suggest that attempting to seamlessly integrate the SWAT into the host study may have inadvertently led to it becoming 'invisible' to consultees. The small number of trials involving participants lacking capacity limits opportunities for developing the evidence-base. Recruitment of host trials continues, with a focus on evaluating the intervention in a broad range of populations and settings. The SWAT is registered as SWAT #159 with the Northern Ireland Hub for Trials Methodology Research SWAT repository (registered 09.08.2020).",

Furthermore, there is limited or no knowledge in the literature on the comparative analysis of OSH risk management policies between North America (Saskatchewan, Canada, and the USA) and Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand). This review employed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to ensure the eligibility of included regional OSH policies and employed the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study (PICOS) framework to develop search questions. This review conducted a high-level qualitative analysis to assess and compare the types of OSH policies and utilized a quantitative analysis to determine the effectiveness of these policies in the regions based on the data associated with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8.1.1. A qualitative analysis of regional OSH policies revealed that the North American regions adopted more performance-based OSH policy styles. In contrast, Southeast Asian regions tended to practice more prescriptive OSH policies. Singapore reported the lowest injury rates (both non-fatal and fatal) and the highest ratio of OSH inspectors to workers. General multivariate regression analysis indicated a significant and positive relationship between the ratios of OSH inspectors to employed persons and non-fatal injury rates, but the negative relationship between the OSH inspectors and fatal injury rate was neither significant nor reliable. The findings of this research validate the current literature. Additionally, higher ratios of OSH Inspectors to employed persons may significantly contribute to reducing regional non-fatal injuries. With larger sample sizes and primary research data, future researchers can build upon the findings of this research, including the optimal effective ratios of OSH inspectors to employed persons to prevent or minimize human suffering and loss. Practitioners may constantly monitor the effectiveness of the ratios to enhance the Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) 8.1.1 performance in the regions.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of a synthesis of longitudinal studies that clarify the relationship between gaming disorder (GD) symptoms and mental health. To address this gap, we undertook a systematic review with meta-analysis of longitudinal studies. The study protocol was preregistered online on PROSPERO (CRD42023407665). We included studies analyzing the association between GD or problematic/pathological videogame use, and internalizing psychopathology (depression and anxiety), psychological distress (loneliness and stress), and well-being (life satisfaction, quality of life, and well-being). Research articles were searched in PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed, and Web of Science up until December 29, 2022.30 articles were considered for meta-analysis (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;28,782). Effect sizes (partial correlation) were pooled using random-effects models. Sensitivity analyses excluded studies rated as \"poor\" - using the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for observational cohort studies - and Chinese studies. The associations between GD and subsequent depression, emotional mixed symptoms (i.e., a combination of internalizing symptoms) and life satisfaction were statistically significant. GD was not associated with subsequent anxiety. On the other hand, depression, anxiety, emotional mixed symptoms, life satisfaction and loneliness were significantly associated with subsequent GD. Overall, sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the main results. In conclusion, this study found reciprocal longitudinal associations between GD and depression, life satisfaction, and emotional mixed symptoms, an effect of anxiety on GD (but not the inverse), and of loneliness on GD. However, the causal nature and practical relevance remain uncertain because effect sizes were small - or medium, depending on effect size guidelines - and based on observational studies.",

    "abstract": "In Japan, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake has been hindered by public distrust and misinformation. Understanding which message components can effectively influence mothers' vaccine decision-making is critical for restoring confidence and improving coverage. To assess the impact of different message components on mothers' willingness to vaccinate their daughters against HPV. This study employed an online 2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2 between-person factorial randomized controlled trial with a nationally representative sample of 1439 Japanese mothers of daughters aged 11-18. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of 16 digital text-based messages varying by four components: messenger (individual or organization), content (effectiveness or safety), style (storytelling or scientific data), and misinformation (misinformation or factual information). Outcomes were willingness to vaccinate, confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness, message trust, and concern about HPV-related diseases. Logistic regression and model fit statistics were used to assess the impact of components. Among 1324 mothers analyzed, messages with factual information significantly increased willingness to vaccinate daughters compared to misinformation (25.9&#xa0;% vs. 11.3&#xa0;%; OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.75; 95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.02-3.74), while trust was higher for organizational messages (91.6&#xa0;%; OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.58; 95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.10-2.27). Storytelling messages increased concerns about HPV-related diseases more than scientific data (40.4&#xa0;% vs. 31.9&#xa0;%, OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.45; 95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.15-1.82). Although factual information and trusted sources positively influenced attitudes, a single digital message was insufficient to significantly increase vaccination uptake. Furthermore, misinformation reduced confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness. Digital messages containing factual information and delivered by organizations positively influence mothers' intentions to vaccinate their daughters against HPV in Japan. These findings support strategies that emphasize trusted sources and factual content while countering misinformation to improve vaccine confidence and uptake. The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06347627).",

    "abstract": "Maternal healthcare service utilisation during pregnancy, childbirth and the subsequent postpartum periods could improve the health outcomes of women and newborns. However, women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) have a lower uptake of these services, which is partly attributed to a lack of access to preferred maternal health services. This study systematically synthesised evidence on women's preferences for maternal healthcare services in LMICs. A systematic search was undertaken from PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus and Global Health databases, and supplemented with Google Scholar for grey literature. We have included published articles from 1 January 2000 to the date of the last search, 14 July 2023. Studies were included if they reported preferences of women for maternal health services in LMICs using the stated preference analysis methods. The quality of the included papers was assessed using the conjoint analysis applications in the healthcare checklist. We have thematically presented the attributes using a healthcare access framework (accessibility, availability, accommodation, affordability and acceptability). The first two most important and least important attributes in each study were identified based on the relative importance scores. Of the 54 articles identified for full-text review, 15 studies from eight LMICs met the inclusion criteria for the final review. Attributes related to the acceptability of healthcare services, such as a provider's good attitude and rapport (47.1%), and the availability of services, such as medications and supplies (41.2%), were typically considered the most important by women. Conversely, accessibility attributes, such as increased distance or travel time to health facilities (29.4%), and affordability attributes, such as increased cost of services (23.5%), were generally less valued by women. The acceptability and availability attributes of healthcare services were considered the most important by women. Aligning maternal healthcare service provision with women's preferences can promote person-centred care, leading to increased service uptake. CRD42023444415.",

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant concern for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, with a need to balance effective thromboprophylaxis and bleeding risk. We aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and budget impact of aspirin versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as sole thromboprophylactic agents initiated immediately postoperatively in this population. First, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases, assessing clinical outcomes and healthcare costs. Subsequently, a simplified budget impact analysis was performed using data from the largest identified and most recent RCT (CRISTAL trial) and its secondary analyses. Primary outcomes included symptomatic VTE, bleeding events, and reoperation rates. Through a systematic search, seven RCTs were considered to be eligible, with the CRISTAL trial providing the most compelling evidence. Aspirin was non-inferior to LMWH for all-cause mortality but was associated with a significantly higher symptomatic VTE rate (3,27% vs. 1,76%) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), predominantly distal DVT. The budget impact analysis revealed that despite aspirin's lower per tablet cost, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH led to annual savings of $35,912,459 to $110,431,241 for U.S. healthcare stakeholders, and $17,075 to $56,450 for single hospitals performing 1000 arthroplasty procedures annually. To conclude, enoxaparin appears to offer superior clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness compared to aspirin for thromboprophylaxis following hip and knee arthroplasty. These findings support the preferential use of LMWH in this setting, while highlighting the need for further investigation into the clinical significance of aspirin's higher distal DVT and pulmonary embolism risk.",

    "abstract": "Many individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder ('psychosis') lack capacity to make decisions about psychiatric treatment ('incapacity'), however we lack robust evidence from clinical trials on interventions to improve it. To accelerate their development, we tested whether an 'umbrella' trial was feasible. This involved running multiple randomised controlled 'interventionist-causal' trials (IC-RCTs) concurrently. Each tested the effect on incapacity of targeting an individual psychological mechanism. We did 3 assessor-blind, multi-site, pilot IC-RCTs. Each compared 6 sessions of psychological therapy for either self-stigma (SS), low self-esteem (SE) or the jumping-to-conclusions (JTC) bias, to 6 sessions of collaborative assessment of the causes of incapacity (control). Adults with psychosis, incapacity and &#x2265;1 target mechanism could participate. Primary outcomes were recruitment feasibility, and data retention on the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment (MacCAT-T). We recruited 57 participants and performed 60 randomisations (3 patients participated in 2 trials); 82&#xa0;% provided post-treatment data.

    "abstract": "Around 310,000 new cases of breast cancer (BC) are diagnosed each year. Complex treatment options often overwhelm patients. Patient decision aids (PDAs) assist in surgical decision-making, but reviews of their quality and efficacy are limited. This study systematically reviews breast surgery (BS) and breast reconstruction (BR) PDAs using the International Patient Decision Aid Standards and Cochrane tools to identify gaps and provide evidence-based recommendations. A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines examined the impact of PDAs on decision-making for BC patients considering BS and BR. From 1198 articles, 35 met the inclusion criteria. Data on PDA components, study design, and results were extracted, focusing on decisional conflict and anxiety, measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). PDA quality and study design were assessed using Cochrane, IPDASi, and ROBINS-I tools. Eight studies evaluated the effect of PDAs on decisional conflict. The pooled mean difference of 3.08 points (95% CI: -&#xa0;0.62 to 6.79, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.10) favored the PDA group but was not statistically significant. Two studies, however, reported notable reductions in decisional conflict with effect sizes of 13.50 and 12.80 points, respectively. The pooled effect size of PDA exposure on patient anxiety was 1.93 (95% CI: -&#xa0;0.46 to 4.31) in favor of PDAs, but was not statistically significant (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.11). The evaluation of PDA content quality revealed variable results. BS and BR PDAs were not found to significantly reduce decisional conflict and anxiety in breast cancer patients.

    "abstract": "Problematic Social Network Sites Use (PSNSU) has been defined as the inability to self-regulate one's use of social networks that adversely affects the user's interpersonal relationships, work or academic activities, and psychological well-being. Among PSNSU risk factors, impulsivity has gained attention. Evidence has emerged about the importance of considering impulsivity from a multidimensional approach since specific dimensions of impulsivity were found to be involved in specific addictive behaviors. Therefore, the present meta-analysis aims to examine the association between PSNSU and (i) general impulsivity and (ii) specific dimensions of impulsivity. A keyword-based systematic literature search was performed for eligible studies in which impulsivity and PSNSU were assessed. The meta-analysis was conducted following the most updated PRISMA guidelines. Forty-one studies were included in the quantitative analysis with 43 independent samples. Meta-analytic results of the random effects model showed a significant positive correlation between general impulsivity and PSNSU (Fisher's Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.29; CI 0.24, 0.35; Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;10.66). Concerning dimensions of impulsivity, meta-analytic results of the random effects model revealed a significant positive correlation between PSNSU and lack of premeditation (Fisher's Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.11 CI 0.09, 0.13; Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;13.25) and between PSNSU and lack of perseverance (Fisher's Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.19; CI 0.17, 0.20; Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;22.67). Significant positive correlations between PSNSU and attentional impulsivity (Fisher's Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.18; CI 0.12, 0.23; Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;6.29), non-planning impulsivity (Fisher's Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.10; CI 0.02, 0.19; Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;2.35), and motor impulsivity (Fisher's Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.22; CI 0.16, 0.27; Z&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.45) were also found. These results confirmed that PSNSU is positively associated with impulsivity and helped to clarify which specific dimensions of impulsivity are involved in this association.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEffective shared decision making (SDM) in health care involves thorough discussions of options, pros, cons, and patient preferences. While SDM is recommended for engaging adults aged 76 to 85 y in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decisions, the extent of SDM documentation in clinical notes remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the current state of SDM documentation in clinical notes regarding CRC screening discussions for adults aged 76 to 85 y. It also sought to assess the impact of an SDM training intervention on documentation quality and compare documented SDM elements with physician- and patient-reported SDM.MethodsData from 465 patient participants and 58 primary care physicians in a multisite cluster randomized trial were analyzed. Physicians in the intervention arm underwent a 2-h SDM skills training and received support tools, including an electronic health record SmartPhrase. Coders analyzed clinical notes using content analysis to identify SDM elements. Linear multilevel models and multilevel partial correlations were used for analysis.ResultsOverall, SDM Note scores were low (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#xaf;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math> = 0.80, <i>s</i> = 0.99). The intervention arm exhibited higher SDM Note scores than the comparator arm did (adjusted mean 1.02 v. 0.66; <i>P</i> = 0.006), with more frequent documentation of stool-based tests (52% v. 33%; <i>P</i> = 0.02) and colonoscopy cons (28% v. 8%; <i>P</i> = 0.001). No significant differences were observed in patient preference documentation. SDM Note scores correlated moderately with patient- and physician-reported SDM.ConclusionDocumentation of CRC screening discussions with older adults lacks comprehensive SDM elements. The intervention improved SDM documentation, particularly regarding alternative screening options and potential cons. Given the limited documentation of SDM even after a training intervention, attention to more robust SDM documentation, including patient preferences and discussion of stopping CRC screening, is needed.HighlightsShared decision-making (SDM) documentation in clinical notes is limited for discussions on colon cancer screening among older adults.SDM training improves SDM documentation of screening options for colorectal cancer, specifically documentation of stool-based testing and the downsides of screening options.SDM documentation in clinical notes is related to patient and provider reports of SDM.",

    "abstract": "Stakeholder preference evaluations are increasingly emphasized in healthcare policy and health technology assessment. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are the most common method for quantifying preferences among patients, the public, and healthcare professionals. While prior reviews (1990-2017) have examined DCE trends, no comprehensive synthesis exists for studies published since 2018. This updated review (2018-2023) provides critical insights into evolving methodologies and global trends in health-related DCEs. A systematic search (2018-2023) of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science identified relevant studies. Studies were screened for inclusion and data were extracted, including details on DCE design and analysis. To enable trend comparisons, the search strategy and extraction items aligned with previous reviews. Of 2663 identified papers, 1279 met the inclusion criteria, reflecting a significant rise in published DCEs over time. DCEs were conducted globally, with a remarkable increase in publications from Asia and Africa compared with previous reviews. Experimental designs and econometric models have advanced, continuing prior trends. Notably, most recent DCEs were administered online. The rapid growth of DCE applications underscores their importance in health research. While the methodology is advancing rapidly, it is crucial that researchers provide full transparency in reporting their methods, particularly in detailing experimental designs and validity tests, which are too often overlooked. Key recommendations include improving reporting of experimental designs, applying validity tests, following good practices for presenting benefit-risk attributes, and adopting open science practices. Ensuring methodological rigor will maximize the impact and reproducibility of DCE research in health economics.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced cancer often have to make difficult end-of-life decisions, which are closely associated with their access to anticipated care after loss of mental capacity. Advance care planning, an approach of discussing, documenting, and deciding on end-of-life preferences, helps with better decision-making. However, despite being recommended for oncology care, its efficacy for patients with advanced cancer remains unclear. To explore the effects of advance care planning in patients with advanced cancer. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Twelve electronic databases, including Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL complete, CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Google Scholar and Proguest Dissertations and Theses, were searched from inception to December 2024. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with R software, and outcomes not amenable to meta-analysis were narratively synthesized. Fourteen studies were included. The results of the meta-analysis implied that advance care planning significantly improved the completion of advance directives (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;7.93, 95&#xa0;% CI: 2.76-22.77, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0001) and palliative care utilization (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.39, 95&#xa0;% CI: 1.08-1.78, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0009). Anxiety (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.14, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.52-0.23, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.45), depression (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.10, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.55-0.34, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.66), decisional conflicts (MD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.25, 95&#xa0;% CI: -3.67-1.18, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.31), patient satisfaction (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.19, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.23-0.70, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.47), and quality of life (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.32, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.83-1.48, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.58) were not improved. In the narrative synthesis, dignity was enhanced, but the effects of concordance between actual care received and preferences were inconsistent. In general, existing advance care planning is primarily delivered in a face-to-face format in hospitals and focuses on older patients. Advance care planning may have desirable impacts on improving the completion of advance directives and palliative care utilization for patients with advanced cancer. It was not effective in improving anxiety, depression, decisional conflicts, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. The effects of dignity and care concordance need to be further validated. Young patient-specific, digital technology-based, and in-home advance care planning is encouraged, and the optimal timing of interventions also needs to be clarified.",

Results showed that twelve studies used qualitative or mixed methods, with determinants primarily focusing on individual factors (e.g., PwD symptoms, caregiver burden), while interpersonal, community, and societal levels were overlooked. Care arrangement decisions were underexplored, and research lacked robust theoretical foundations. Current research focuses predominantly on individual-level factors while paying less attention to modifiable determinants from broader levels. The insufficient attention to care arrangement decisions and theoretical frameworks calls for a more comprehensive approach. Using Social Ecological Model, SDM interventions should simultaneously address individual needs, prioritize modifiable interpersonal factors, and incorporate broader environmental determinants to create comprehensive support systems on dementia caregiving.",

In this preregistered meta-analysis, we integrated data from 29 studies to estimate the associations between the Big Five personality traits with volunteering (<i>N</i> = 91,241, median age = 34 years, 61% female, 36% U.S. samples) and charitable giving (<i>N</i> = 3,559, median age = 39 years, 52% female, 40% U.S. samples). We further examined potential moderators, including the types of personality and philanthropic behavior measures used, gender, age, and sample region, to begin to explain the substantial heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies. Results indicated modest but robust correlations between the Big Five personality traits, volunteering, and charitable giving, with the largest effect sizes emerging for the links between extraversion and volunteering (<i>r</i> = .09, 95% CI [.05, .12]) and for agreeableness and charitable giving (<i>r</i> = .14, 95% CI [.04, .25]). There was little evidence for systematic moderator effects. We describe the theoretical implications of these results for future research, discuss practical applications, and highlight gaps in this body of literature.

    "abstract": "This systematic review aims to examine the neural correlates of reward processing in various forms of Internet Addiction (IA) among adults, including generalized IA and specific conditions such as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). The study seeks to identify distinct patterns of altered connectivity and activation in reward-related brain regions across different IA subtypes. We analyzed findings from 44 neuroimaging studies, aligning with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. The review focused on three key aspects of reward processing: responsiveness, learning, and valuation. Studies included both structural and functional neuroimaging data from adult populations with various forms of IA. Findings suggest distinct patterns of altered connectivity and activation in reward-related brain regions across different IA subtypes. IGD is associated with widespread abnormalities in both structural and functional connectivity within the reward network, whereas excess social media use primarily affects the amygdala-striatal system. However, methodological limitations, including variability in IA definitions, lack of comparative studies between IA subtypes, and predominance of cross-sectional designs, hinder definitive conclusions. This review underscores the need for a nuanced approach to IA, recognizing potentially distinct neural mechanisms across subtypes. Such insights could inform the development of targeted interventions and enhance the clinical utility of IA research and treatment. Future research should address current methodological limitations to provide more definitive conclusions about the neurobiological underpinnings of various forms of IA.",

    "abstract": "Empirical research investigated psycho-social factors associated with the development and maintenance of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in children and adolescents, but their potential role has not been highlighted in systematic reviews. The aims of the current systematic review were to (1) summarize and synthesize findings from empirical research on family factors related to children and adolescents' IGD; (2) identify familial protective and risk factors that are related to the development and maintenance of IGD in children and adolescents, and (3) provide suggestions for future research. A number of 64 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria in the review from the following databases: Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest, Google Academic, and APA PsycNet. Family variables have been significantly connected to gaming addiction levels in children and adolescents. Results were divided into five main themes: parental mediation, positive parenting, poor parenting, familial disharmony, and familial socioeconomic status. Protective factors included parental knowledge and positive parenting, while poor parenting, familial disharmony and familial socioeconomic status with all their sub-themes represented risk factors. Restrictive mediation and affected parenting provided inconclusive results that deserve further research. Familial connection is imperative for gaming addiction prevention. A stressful familial environment (e.g., parental conflicts) could increase gaming addiction coping behavior. Longitudinal and cross-sectional results provided inconsistent results regarding the role of parental depression and parental mediation in children's gaming addiction development. Cross-cultural studies are needed on familial factors related to children's gaming addiction. Further longitudinal studies could provide answers for conflicting or underexplored areas.",

    "abstract": "Child health and gender inequalities are significant global public health issues that demand immediate action, particularly in South and Southeast Asian (SSEA) countries where both challenges are prevalent. This study examines the association between women's empowerment and child vaccination coverage in 11 SSEA low- and middle-income countries. Using population-level cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys across 11 SSEA countries, we developed an Individual-Level Women's Empowerment Index (ILWEI) based on three dimensions of women's empowerment: decision-making autonomy, attitude towards intimate partner violence and social independence. A three-stage mixed-effect individual participant data meta-analysis was employed to assess the association between ILWEI and childhood immunisation coverage. In India, 81.28% of women reported participation in three to four decision-making areas, followed by 62.07% in Bangladesh. Full immunisation coverage ranged from 32.43% in Afghanistan to 63.30% in Bangladesh. The association between women's empowerment and vaccination coverage varied across South and Southeast Asia, with the strongest positive associations observed in Pakistan. However, mixed or negative associations were found in countries such as India and Timor-Leste. Our findings indicate that in several SSEA countries, including Pakistan, Cambodia, the Philippines and Afghanistan, higher levels of individual women's empowerment are positively associated with an increased likelihood of childhood immunisation coverage. However, in countries such as India, Myanmar and Timor-Leste, higher women's empowerment was associated with lower odds of childhood immunisation, highlighting potential contextual or systemic barriers that may hinder vaccination uptake. This underscores the critical role of women's empowerment in enhancing childhood vaccination intake while also emphasising the need for targeted interventions to address country-specific challenges. Coordinated, multifaceted strategies are essential to empower women and thereby support the immunisation of children across regions.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to analyze studies assessing the extent to which General Practitioners (GPs) engage patients in the decision-making process during consultations. Shared Decision Making (SDM) stands at the core of patient-centred care, particularly in primary healthcare, where a diverse array of medical decisions transpires. In a 2015 systematic review summarizing studies on the Observing Patient Involvement in Decision Making (OPTION) instrument to assess SDM objectively across healthcare settings, a notable dearth of patient involvement was observed. A comprehensive literature search encompassing three digital databases was conducted up to November 2023. Inclusion criteria focused on studies employing a comparative study design, centric to primary healthcare, and utilizing the OPTION-5 or -12 instrument to gauge SDM levels. Two investigators independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction using a list of predefined variables, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. PROSPERO registration-ID: CRD42023475419. Initially, harvesting 447 articles, our review retained 29 studies published between 2003 and 2022. Mean age of GPs was 45.5 (range 33-53) years. Reported baseline OPTION scores varied between 1.5 and 57.2 on a 0-100-point scale, with a median score of 16. Following SDM interventions, OPTION-scores increased significantly to a median of 28.5, range 16-83. The overall level of SDM among GPs remains relatively low and has shown minimal improvement over the past decade. However, interventions promoting SDM appear to enhance patient involvement levels. This underscores the necessity for increased education and tools, directed at GPs and patients, to foster and elevate the practice of SDM.",

Young adults were administered one week of well-rested sleep levels (WR: 8-9&#xa0;h/night) and sleep-restriction (SR: 5-6&#xa0;h/night) in their (naturalistic) at-home setting, using a randomized cross-over design. Participants made consequential bids for snacks/beverages following SR and WR in an auction task.

Multivariate regression analyses examined main and moderator impacts of SR on primary outcome measures. In total, 118 treatment participants completed the study (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;20 years old, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;65 females). SR predicted increased self-reported daily caloric intake and importance of taste (over healthiness) in auction bids, but only in participants with higher baseline cognitive or behavioral control characteristics (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.05). Furthermore, SR predicted reduced average hourly PA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.01), increased sedentary behaviors (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.01), and more prolonged bouts of sitting (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.01) for all participants. While prior literature suggests dietary choices may mediate the link between SR and obesity, we did not find altered dietary choices. Rather, our results suggest decreased PA may also contribute to the link between SR and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often aim to address maladaptive approach-avoidance behavior patterns. Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) offers a potential framework for identifying treatment outcome predictors and informing optimization of GAD treatment. The current study examined whether pre-treatment neurobehavioral AAC indices predict symptom improvement in behavioral activation (BA) and exposure therapy (EXP) for GAD. Treatment-seeking adults meeting criteria for GAD completed a randomized clinical trial with pre-treatment blinding, conducted from 2016-2021. Participants were randomized to complete 10 manualized sessions of BA or EXP. Participants completed an AAC task during functional magnetic resonance imaging pre-treatment. Computational parameters of task behavior were derived, and neural activity was assessed during decision-making and positive and negative outcomes of decisions. Outcome measures were GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms. Of 121 participants recruited, 56 (29 BA, 27 EXP; mean age 33.0 years; 12.5% male) treatment completers were included in analyses. Greater AAC task avoidance (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.28) and greater left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during negative outcomes (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.32), predicted greater symptom reduction across treatments. Blunted left amygdala activation to positive outcomes was associated at a trend level with favorable symptom reduction for BA but not EXP (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.20). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be a target for enhancing behavior therapy outcomes generally, while left amygdala activation to positive affect may be a target for enhancing outcomes for BA. These findings may inform the optimization of behavioral therapies for GAD and hold potential for transdiagnostic applications, warranting larger, longitudinal studies in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Inducements are a core component of gambling marketing. They have attracted increased attention from regulators due to their potential links to gambling harms. We deployed a randomised, pre-registered online experiment to test whether inducements cause specific changes to gambling behaviour. 622 males aged under 40 made incentive-compatible betting choices over Euro 2024 football matches. Participants were randomised to see bets with inducements or to a control group with no inducements. Some participants were also randomised to see inducement-linked bets where the expected value odds made them the worst available choice, i.e., a dominated option that was an objectively \"bad bet\" even accounting for the inducement. Inducements increased the amount spent on bets by over 10% and almost halved the number of people opting not to bet. Those with evidence of problem gambling were disproportionately affected. Inducements also led to decision errors, making bettors three times more likely to choose bad bets. Our findings add to growing evidence that inducements risk causing harm to consumers, with worse effects among those with evidence of problem gambling. We provide novel evidence that inducements push gamblers into making decision errors, opting for bad bets that heighten the risk of financial harm. Our findings support the regulation of inducements to reduce gambling harms.",

    "abstract": "Problematic smartphone use (PSU), characterized by excessive and compulsive engagement with smartphones, is significantly shaped by the family environment. Recent studies have shown that childhood maltreatment (CM) is associated with increased PSU. Despite this growing recognition, comprehensive, quantitative evaluations of this connection remain scarce. The present meta-analysis aims to synthesize existing quantitative evidence on the relationship between PSU and CM. We systematically searched databases including Web of Science, ProQuest, PubMed, Elsevier ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Weipu for studies published up to March 1, 2025. Eligible papers were quantitative, peer-reviewed studies that allowed statistical calculation of the relationship between PSU and CM. Across 51 studies (99&#xa0;effect sizes), a moderate positive correlation was found between CM and PSU (r = 0.264, 95% CI&#xa0;[0.226, 0.301], p &lt; 0.001). Notably, as age increases, the impact of physical and sexual abuse on individuals appears to diminish, whereas this age-related effect was not observed for other forms of maltreatment. No significant moderating effects were observed for maltreatment type, measurement tools, study design, gender, sample type (college vs. non-college), or publication type. The findings highlight the family environment's key role in PSU. Children who experience maltreatment require special attention to their smartphone usage, along with targeted interventions to address both the harms of maltreatment and excessive smartphone use.",

We conducted a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of the investigated topics to achieve this objective. Five databases (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science) systematically searched for studies that analyzed the relationship between LA and attachment dimensions, published in all years until September 23, 2024. Overall, we found 27 studies; of these, we included 15 in the meta-analysis, with 3,628 participants. The analyses were conducted using the test of heterogeneity, effect dispersion, and moderator analysis (gender, age, research continent, quality of the studies, and types of attachment instruments). A significant and positive relationship (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0 .05) was observed between Love Addiction and anxious attachment, while a significant and negative relationship was found with avoidant attachment (r = -0.09, p &lt; 0.05). The systematic review and meta-analysis provide an important starting point for understanding and operationalizing the construct. The association with attachment styles allows postulating the relational nature of Love Addiction, differentiating it from other addictions. In addition, the association with anxious and avoidant attachment shows promise in understanding Love Addict subtypes.",

    "title": "Measuring Decisional Regret in Orthopedic Surgery: Tools, Time Points, and Score Interpretation.",
    "abstract": "As shared decision-making models gain prominence, patients are taking on more responsibility in deciding whether to undergo surgery. Decisional regret is a key patient-reported outcome (PRO) to evaluate quality of care and surgical success. With increased emphasis on decisional regret, determining the tools to measure regret is of increasing importance. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate and identify the tools used to measure decisional regret in elective orthopedic surgery and (2) examine the time frame in which regret is measured postoperatively. The authors conducted a systematic literature review of PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases from database inception until September 5, 2024. All studies that discussed a patient's decisional regret in the context of elective orthopedic surgery were eligible. Initial results yielded 1,002 articles, and 26 were chosen for inclusion. The Decisional Regret Scale (DRS) was the most used tool, appearing in 54% of the articles. Novel, study-specific questions were used in 19% of the studies, while 15% used question 22 of the Scoliosis Research Society-22 tool and 11% used non-standardized patient interviews. Regret was assessed postoperatively at &gt;24 months in 15% of studies, at 24 months in 17%, at 12 months in 22%, at 6 months in 26%, at multiple time frames in 4%, and was not stated in 8%. Decisional regret is an increasingly important PRO that can help optimize medical interventions. The DRS, used in more than half of the studies analyzed, is the most widely adopted and validated tool for quantifying regret and should be prioritized in future research. While timing of regret assessment varied, the 6-month and 12-month postoperative intervals were the most common and are suggested as standard time points for measuring regret. Additionally, establishing clinical stratifications for regret scores will facilitate meta-analysis and improve risk factor identification, enhancing shared decision-making and patient care.

    "abstract": "People often make judgments about uncertain facts and events, for example 'Germany will win the world cup'. Judgment under uncertainty is often studied with reference to a normative ideal according to which people should make guesses that have a high probability of being correct. According to this normative ideal, you should say that Germany will win the world cup if you think that Germany is in fact likely to win. We argue that in many cases, judgment under uncertainty is instead best conceived of as an act of lossy compression, where the goal is to efficiently encode a probability distribution, rather than express the probability of a single outcome. We test formal computational models derived from our theory, showing in four experiments that they accurately predict how people make and interpret guesses. Our account naturally explains why people dislike vacuously-correct guesses (like 'Some country will win the world cup'), and sheds light on apparently sub-optimal patterns of judgment such as the conjunction fallacy.",

Fifteen discrete models were identified, with results indicating inconsistency in terminology use and meanings. Models that consider real-world performance within an individual's contextual environment are increasingly utilising economics related terminology such as financial capability. The majority of papers related to people with dementia and were multidisciplinary in authorship, or from the psychology literature.

    "abstract": "Before full achieving automation, Autonomous Vehicle(AV) must undergo a transitional phase of human-machine collaborative driving. Therefore, designing appropriate Human-Machine Interface (HMI) modes of collaboration is key to ensuring both driving safety and user experience. However, existing research has rarely considered the design of human-machine collaboration modes under different Hazard Visibility scenarios. In this study, we conducted a simulated driving experiment (N = 28) to explore the effects of three HMI-based collaboration modes (HMI1, HMI2, and HMI3) on driving behavior and subjective perception under two hazard visibility scenarios (visible and invisible hazard). The designs of the three collaboration modes were primarily based on varying levels of explainability and control. The results show that in the invisible hazard scenario, drivers exhibited significantly lower situation awareness and preference compared to the visible hazard scenario. The design of HMI in different collaboration modes significantly influences drivers' situation awareness, cognitive workload, trust, and attention distribution, with the highest satisfaction reported for HMI2 (high explainability, AV-led decision-making). Particularly in the invisible hazard scenario, HMI2 significantly improved drivers' situation awareness and attention while minimizing cognitive workload. The study also indicates that during autonomous driving, drivers require a certain sense of control, though this does not necessarily mean they need to directly participate in decision-making. Instead, a sense of control can be fostered by augmenting the explainability of the HMI. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of human-machine interfaces in AV to enhance driving safety.",

    "abstract": "Diet-related diseases are a global health concern, prompting governments to implement population-wide dietary improvements. In the UK, the traffic light system (TLS) of nutritional labelling aims to guide healthier food choices. However, concerns have arisen about whether retailer price promotions may counteract positive effects of the TLS on diet. To address these concerns, in the present research we investigated the effects of the TLS and price promotions on the healthiness of food choice, both individually and in combination. A pre-registered online randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted using a 2x3 factorial between-subjects design with TLS (control vs. TLS) and price promotion (no promotion vs. healthiest product promotion vs. unhealthiest product promotion) as interventions. A total of 1582 UK participants were randomised across the experimental conditions and asked to make a hypothetical purchase choice amongst four unbranded snack bars of varying healthiness. Price promotions were found to effectively increase the likelihood of choosing a promoted product, whether healthy or unhealthy. Price promotions on the unhealthiest food item were found to decrease the likelihood of the healthiest product being chosen. TLS labelling did not significantly impact food choice relative to the control. However, there was a tendency for the labelling to amplify the effect of price promotions on healthy products and dampen the effect on unhealthy products. Overall, our research offers new insights into how different forces may interact when multiple policy interventions are implemented in the retail environment and highlights the need to examine them in combination.",

Patients who perceived the timing as \"too early\" were more recently diagnosed with cancer (9.1 months) or with their current cancer stage (5.7 months) than those who did not. Patients perceiving the timing as \"too late\" had shorter estimated survival times. Patients with advanced cancer may benefit from earlier ACP than what is currently typically initiated in clinical practice. When initiating ACP conversations, several aspects should be considered, including patients' gender, their socio-cultural environment, and their ability to perform daily activities, with or without limitations.",

    "title": "Patients' requests and physicians' prescribing behavior. A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Patients' requests is a frequently cited factor in the literature affecting doctors' prescribing decisions. This systematic review aims to consolidate quantitative findings, shedding light on the relationship between patient requests and the actions taken by general practitioners. A broader perspective was adopted by not limiting our investigation to specific medication categories. Instead, we treat the act of requesting as a communicative behavior, separate from the pharmacological context. A comprehensive search across various online databases was performed. Two authors independently contributed the screening phase. The selection of articles and the data extraction were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flowchart. Patient's request demonstrated to be a driving factor for physician's prescribing behavior not only when antibiotics are involved, but as a more generalized trend. The study acknowledges the complexity of patient-provider communication, emphasizing the asymmetry in roles and the tension between patient empowerment and medical expertise. By uncovering the underlying mechanisms shaping doctors' responses to patient requests, this systematic review enhances our understanding of communication in healthcare settings. Understanding the impact of patient requests on prescribing decisions highlights the importance of training healthcare providers in effective communication strategies that balance patient autonomy with clinical judgment. These insights can inform guidelines and interventions aimed at managing patient expectations, supporting more evidence-based prescribing practices and fostering better doctor-patient relationships.",

Six classes, a total of 93 high school students (75&#xa0;% females, Mage&#xa0;=&#xa0;16.26, SD = 1.24), were randomly assigned to either the Training or No Training group. The intervention spanned five weekly sessions, incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy and the conceptual change model to modify metacognitive beliefs. Pre- and post-test measures included daily time spent on the mobile phone, risky behaviors related to smartphone use, and metacognitive beliefs about smartphone use. A mixed ANOVA indicated a significant reduction in daily time spent on the mobile phone and risky behaviors related to smartphone use only in the Training group, with large effect sizes. Findings are promising and discussed in terms of future improvement.",

    "abstract": "Decision making is a critical skill for sports officials, often directly influencing the flow and fairness of a match. While this topic has received considerable interest in the literature, a synthesis of current evidence to understand the effectiveness of decision-making training interventions remains unexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of decision-making interventions in team sport officials. A total of 14 studies were identified, with a random-effects meta-analysis revealing an overall moderate positive effect of decision-making training on decision-making performance outcomes (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.68, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001) compared to control conditions. Notably, decision-making training was more effective in Soccer (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.05), Rugby Union (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.90), but not for Australian Football (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.24). Video-based (i.e., 2-D footage) showed significant improvements, especially for objective decision-making outcomes like offside identification (g&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.48, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). However, our findings indicated that decision-making training tends to be less effective for subjective decision-making outcomes that requires higher levels of interpretation. Furthermore, shorter interventions (4-6 weeks) were found to be most effective, with performance improvements reducing as interventions increased in time. Our findings highlight the need for further research to explore alternative technologies such as virtual reality to understand how to better replicate game scenarios and assess the transferability of decision-making training to real-world officiating contexts. Additionally, this review highlights the need to investigate sports beyond Soccer, Rugby, and Australian Rules Football to develop our understanding further into optimising decision-making training in sports officials.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder (BD) and its treatment are still poorly understood. Here we examined the role of adaptations in risk-taking using a reward-guided decision-making task. We recruited volunteers with high (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;40) scores on the Mood Disorder Questionnaire, MDQ, suspected of high risk for bipolar disorder and those with low-risk scores (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37). We also recruited patients diagnosed with BD who were assigned (randomized, double-blind) to six weeks of lithium (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19) or placebo (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16) after a two-week baseline period (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22 for FMRI). Participants completed mood ratings daily over 50 (MDQ study) or 42 (BD study) days, as well as a risky decision-making task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task measured adaptation of risk taking to past outcomes (increased risk aversion after a previous win vs. loss, 'outcome history'). While the low MDQ group was risk averse after a win, this was less evident in the high MDQ group and least so in the patients with BD. During fMRI, 'outcome history' was linked to medial frontal pole activation at the time of the decision and this activation was reduced in the high risk MDQ vs. the low risk MDQ group. While lithium did not reverse the pattern of BD in the task, nor changed clinical symptoms of mania or depression, it changed reward processing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Participants' modulation of risk-taking in response to reward outcomes was reduced as a function of risk for BD and diagnosed BD. These results provide a model for how reward may prime escalation of risk-related behaviours in bipolar disorder and how mood stabilising treatments may work.",

    "abstract": "Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) is a recurrent mental illness. It severely impacts both physical and mental health, leading to physiological symptoms such as neurological dysfunction and immunosuppression. This condition significantly affects adolescent development and has become a global public health concern. Scientific evidence supports the beneficial impact of integrative mind-body exercises for treating internet addiction disorders. Though these interventions show promise, their therapeutic efficacy exhibits considerable variation across different modalities. Currently, there exists a significant research gap, as no comprehensive clinical investigations have systematically evaluated the comparative therapeutic outcomes of distinct mind-body practices among individuals diagnosed with internet addiction. To conduct a network meta-analytic investigation comparing the therapeutic efficacy of diverse mind-body exercise interventions for addressing symptoms associated with internet addiction disorder. Data were retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, and VIP databases. After screening and data extraction, network meta-analysis was performed using STATA 18.0.

    "title": "Factors affecting caregivers' HPV vaccination decisions for adolescent girls: A secondary analysis of a Chinese RCT.",
    "abstract": "Despite the HPV vaccine's effectiveness against cervical cancer, uptake among adolescent girls in China remains low, with caregivers playing a crucial role in vaccination decisions. This study investigates factors influencing caregivers' action to vaccinate their adolescent daughters. Pay-it-forward is a novel model that motivates participants in adopting healthy behaviors and making community contributions. In this study, it offers an individual a free shot of HPV vaccine and then asks whether they would like to donate to support another person to get the same vaccination. This study was embedded in a two-arm randomized controlled trial in China. Potential associated factors were identified based on Anderson's Health Service Utilization Behavioral Model and analyzed through univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. Caregivers' information, knowledge, attitudes, vaccine confidence, hesitancy, and willingness to vaccinate were collected through online questionnaires. The endpoint was the receipt of the first dose HPV vaccine following an intervention or no intervention (pay-it-forward vs. standard-of-care), which was obtained from an electronic vaccination registry system. Among 321 caregivers, 25.9% of their daughters received the HPV vaccine, with 34.2% in the pay-it-forward group and 17.5% in the standard-of-care group. Daughters of caregivers who were previously unaware of the HPV vaccine were three times more likely to be vaccinated (OR=3.01,95%CI:1.27-7.14). Caregivers who did not intend to delay vaccination had daughters with eight times higher vaccination uptake (OR=8.26,95%CI:4.36-15.67). Participation in the \"pay-it-forward\" intervention increased vaccination rates by more than twofold (OR=2.22,95%CI:1.19-4.15). Daughters of unemployed or retired caregivers had nearly four times higher vaccination rates compared to those whose caregivers were employed (OR=3.97,95%CI:1.81-8.72). Prior refusal of the vaccine by caregivers was associated with an 80% reduction in vaccination uptake among daughters (OR=0.23,95%CI:0.06-0.81). The pay-it-forward intervention, caregivers' knowledge, intention to delay vaccination, occupation, and prior vaccine refusal significantly influence HPV vaccine uptake among adolescent girls in China. Tailored health education, financial support, and community involvement are essential to encourage HPV vaccination among adolescent girls in China.",

    "title": "Health inequities in medical crowdfunding: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Medical crowdfunding has emerged as a popular strategy to offset healthcare expenses in contexts of limited insurance coverage. While often framed as a democratizing and accessible financial tool, growing evidence indicates that success is unevenly distributed, raising concerns about its role in exacerbating health inequities. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, drawing from PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Of 1,462 screened records, 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. Guided by the PROGRESS framework, we extracted data on socioeconomic determinants of health disparities. An inductive content analysis was employed to identify how equity was assessed across studies. We identified three key categories of metrics used to assess equity in medical crowdfunding: funding outcomes, campaign visibility, and donor participation. Across these domains, substantial disparities were observed. Campaigns in rural or economically disadvantaged areas tended to have lower success rates. Racial and ethnic inequities were consistently documented, with non-white individuals receiving fewer and smaller donations than white counterparts. Gender disparities were complex, especially in transgender-related campaigns. Socioeconomic status and educational attainment were significantly associated with outcomes, accompanied by differences in access to social capital and the ability to craft persuasive narratives. In regions with high medical debt or limited insurance coverage, more crowdfunding campaigns appeared, but with lower overall success. These inequities were shaped and reinforced by platform algorithms and design features that privileged users with preexisting advantages. Rather than serving as a corrective to healthcare access gaps, medical crowdfunding often reflects and reinforces structural inequities. These findings challenge its portrayal as an equitable financing solution and highlight the need for policy interventions to ensure fairer access to healthcare resources.",

    "abstract": "Road safety is a significant developmental delinquent, an issue of public health, and a major global cause of demise and injury. Several research and review articles were focused on road safety concerning road characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and environment. However, a review article concerning land use, budget, and legislation towards road safety needs to be included. The present study reviewed literatures and reports on road safety concerning land use, budget, and legislation. The method used for review was \"Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)\". Initially, the paper discussed the impact of accidents concerning land use. The parameters such as crash type, crash cause, crash severity, traffic violation, infrastructural risk, operational hours, Traffic analysis Zone (TAZ) level crashes, on -network factors and medical service response were influenced by land use. Commercial area was more inclined to risk than other land use types. Later, budget section was examined, and it revealed that fuel subsidies, cost-effective strategies, and advertising budgets had a notable impact on reducing crashes. Road safety budget allocation strategies were impacted by significant parameter such as policy scenario and the performance indicator. Over 50% of road crash costs were related to injuries, while 10% of accident costs were related to delays. Indexes of road safety were reliant on budget. The study concluded by discussing the impact of legislation- changes to the traffic laws were successful in reduction of crashes, however, formulation of laws might or might not be successful in lowering casualities. Furthermore, \"being aware of the laws\" reduced collisions, as well public was persuaded in formulation of law for road safety. Finally, examination of three factors such as land use, budget, and legislation-found an incredible impact on road safety.",

    "abstract": "Cancer often requires patients to make swift, informed, treatment decisions. Despite their engagement with healthcare providers and digital resources, cancer patients over 50 often experience high levels of unmet information needs during these critical times. However, there is a lack of evidence-based information on their supportive-care information needs. To examine cancer patients' (aged 50&#x202f;+) information and health literacy needs and their motivations for using social media (i.e Twitter/X, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram) during decision-making. A systematic literature review, following the PRISMA guidelines, was conducted using electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed/MEDLINE) and grey literature. All original articles published from January 2002 to October 2023 were extracted and analysed within COVIDENCE and NVIVO14 for themes following narrative and tabular analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scale. Of 761 articles identified, six were included. Patients' health literacy was determined to be moderate to low. At decision-making points, cancer patients over 50 needed personalised, supportive and disease-related information. They preferred holistically tailored information and were satisfied with how their doctors met their needs. Complimentary therapies and dietary recommendations were well received by patients of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Australian backgrounds. Patients over 50 accessed social media throughout their cancer. Although useful for obtaining support and information, social media raised patients' concern around misinformation. Our findings highlight the importance of meeting the information needs of cancer patients over 50 and incorporating a holistic approach to information delivery.

    "title": "Financial Literacy and Economic Attitudes as Protective Factors Against Pathological Gambling? A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Pathological gambling poses significant global issues, leading to economic, social, and psychological consequences such as debt, family breakdowns, and mental health problems. While various risk factors for gambling addiction, including comorbid addictions, psychiatric disorders, gender, age, and easy access to gambling venues, have been well-studied, less emphasis is placed on protective factors. Strong social support and higher education are key in mitigating gambling addiction. Higher education, in particular, equips individuals with better decision-making skills and risk management strategies, reducing the likelihood of addictive behaviors. Strengthening education and social support systems is essential for preventing gambling addiction. A systematic review was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO, focusing on studies published after 2000. Peer-reviewed studies written in English that examined the relationship between financial literacy and gambling were included. Studies focusing solely on financial topics or not in English were excluded. The review follows the PROSPERO protocol. Financial literacy is linked to lower rates of pathological gambling, although its impact varies based on&#xa0;cultural context and gambling accessibility. From 880 papers, 8 met the inclusion criteria. Six studies confirmed a relationship between higher financial literacy and reduced gambling behavior, while two studies indicated that the significance of this relationship depended on specific financial literacy dimensions or contextual factors. This research underscores the importance of incorporating consumer education and psychological factors into future gambling addiction prevention strategies, particularly for younger gamblers.",

    "title": "Consumer alternative protein choice in climate change: Temporal landmarks, self-transcendence, and mindset abstraction.",
    "abstract": "This study explores consumer preferences for alternative proteins within the context of pro-environmental choices. The primary objective is to identify and analyze the factors influencing consumers' choices between alternative and traditional proteins, as well as the moderating conditions that shape these preferences. To achieve this, three sequential studies were conducted to examine the differential effects of temporal landmarks, self-transcendence, and mindset abstraction on protein choice. A randomized mixed experimental design was employed, incorporating both between-subjects and within-subjects components. Findings indicate that consumers exhibit a higher propensity to select alternative proteins during morning hours. Moreover, self-transcendence was found to mediate the relationship between temporal landmarks and protein choices, while mindset abstraction moderated this association. This research uniquely integrates temporal psychology, self-transcendence, and construal level theory to explain dynamic sustainable protein choices under climate change. It introduces morning contexts as novel antecedents of self-transcendence, demonstrating that self-transcendence mediates the impact of temporal landmarks on alternative protein preferences, with this relationship being moderated by mindset abstraction. The theoretical contribution lies in linking micro-level temporal cues to macro-level environmental values, providing a unified framework to address the \"when\" (time), \"why\" (self-transcendence), and \"for whom\" (abstract thinkers) of sustainable choices. Also, this research extends existing knowledge of dynamic sustainable consumption patterns. Practical implications include actionable strategies for policymakers and marketers to design time-sensitive interventions, such as morning-targeted campaigns. These initiatives leverage self-transcendent mindsets and abstract thinking to systematically promote sustainable protein adoption, thereby advancing climate change mitigation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Much research has been conducted on takeover behavior in automated driving, and integrating these studies into a knowledge system can help to gain a deeper understanding of the current research status and guide critical future research. The takeover focused in this study refers to the takeover related to human intervention (i.e. the transfer of control between the human driver and the auto drive system), rather than the context of overtaking another vehicle (e.g., lane changes and acceleration). The takeover behavior is a multi-stage process consisting of situation awareness, decision &amp; reaction, and takeover performance stages. An in-depth review of takeover behavior characteristics from the three takeover stages is helpful to describe the takeover process and analyze takeover behavior characteristics systematically. Therefore, this paper aims to review driver's takeover performance from the three levels of driver, automated vehicle, and road environment based on the takeover behavior mode. First, we identified 1329 articles through a systematic literature search. 122 articles were included in this review. Second, we use the knowledge graph method for bibliometric analysis. Third, we systematically review the characteristics of takeover behavior in three stages (situation awareness, decision &amp; reaction, takeover performance) from three dimensions: driver, vehicle, and road environment. At the same time, this study develops scoring rules that quantify each factor's contribution to takeover behavior. Fourth, based on the reviewed literature and scores, 18 suggestions were proposed to improve takeover behavior from three levels: drivers, vehicles, road environment. Finally, we have outlined the future fundamental research of takeover behavior. This review summarizes the research content of takeover behavior testing and forms a knowledge system, which provides researchers with a window to understand the research status and development context. This review can guide future research on takeover behavior.",

    "abstract": "We examined the effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on addiction symptoms in patients with internet gaming disorders and examined the moderating effects of participant characteristics, research methodologies, and features of interventions. We systematically searched nine databases through May 2024 without date restrictions using the following search terms: (cognitive behavio* therapy) AND (addict* OR dependen*) AND ((internet or gaming) AND dis*). Studies included were primary studies with evaluating CBT in patients with internet gaming disorders. Studies were included if they used a control group and were written in English. Both randomized control trials and quasi-experimental designs were included. We used a random-effects model to compute effect sizes (ESs) using Hedges' g, forest plot, and Q and I<sup>2</sup> statistics as measures of heterogeneity. We also examined moderator analyses. We found 13 studies with 1,115 participants (19.08&#xb1;3.99 years old) that met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Overall, patients with internet gaming disorders in the CBT group demonstrated significantly lower addiction symptoms (g = 0.72, 95 %CI:.420, 1.011, p&lt;.001) compared to controls. Regarding moderators, funding, characteristics' participants at baseline, group discussion, length of intervention and dose were moderators affecting the ES. CBTs are moderately effective interventions to reduce addiction symptoms among patients with internet gaming disorders. Clinicians might consider encouraging CBTs as alternative treatments for patients with internet gaming disorders. CBTs with a long length and high dose of intervention for practicing are likely to have a greater effect in reducing addiction symptoms.",

    "title": "Provider use of a participatory decision-making style with youth with ADHD and their caregivers and visit satisfaction.",
    "abstract": "To examine whether youth with ADHD who received a question prompt list and video intervention and their caregivers were more likely to: (a) be asked about their treatment preferences, (b) have their input included into treatment decisions, (c) rate their providers as using more of a participatory decision-making (PDM) style, and (d) be more satisfied with their visits. Youth with ADHD were randomized to a pre-visit question prompt list intervention or usual care. Visits were audio-recorded; youth were interviewed after visits; caregivers completed questionnaires. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the data. 102 youth with ADHD and their caregivers participated. Providers included youth and caregiver input into ADHD management decisions during 12&#x202f;% and 20&#x202f;% of audio-taped visits, respectively. Youth and caregivers of youth who were in the intervention group were significantly more likely to rate providers as using more of a participatory decision-making style. Black youth and caregivers were significantly less likely to rate their providers as using a participatory style than non-Black youth. Youth and caregiver ratings of provider use of a participatory style were significantly associated with greater visit satisfaction. Both youth and caregivers rated providers high on using a participatory decision-making style. Yet providers could include youth and caregiver input more into ADHD management decisions. Black youth and caregivers rated providers lower on using a participatory decision-making style than non-Black youth and caregivers. Youth and caregivers were more satisfied with visits where they rated their providers as using a more participatory style. Providers should include both youth and caregiver input into ADHD management decisions. Providers should attempt to use a more participatory decision-making style with Black youth and caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Return to work for cancer survivors (CSs) may be challenging, and there is a research gap in integrating the relevant experiences of the return-to-work decision-making process for CSs. Our aim was to synthesize existing qualitative research that integrates the dynamic experiences of CSs in the return-to-work decision-making process and highlights the factors influencing the return-to-work decisions of CSs. We retrieved qualitative studies on a relevant theme published in the PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases since construction to December 2023. Literature screening, quality evaluation, and data analysis followed the PRISMA, Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool (2016), and thematic analysis methods to ensure study reliability. The study was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42023429623). Ten articles were included, and six key outcomes were identified based on Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) integration: points of concern for individuals, sense of self-efficacy, outcome expectations, work perception and belonging, medical advice and guidance, and effects of the external reactions. The decision-making process for CSs to return to work is affected by various personal and external factors. Effectively addressing personal appearance, financial, and emotional issues can enhance self-efficacy of CSs. Improving external perceptions of cancer patients and enhancing social support in the workplace and medical settings can help CSs make informed decisions regarding their return to work. The decision of CSs to return to work is a result of integrating personal, job, and medical care considerations. These findings contribute to the development of future interventions for CSs' return-to-work decisions that target an array of potential factors.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare resource utilization for Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in Malaysia needs to be clarified. This modified Delphi panel study aimed to describe the clinical pathways for diabetic foot ulcer in Malaysia and to define the healthcare resources used and their costs. A systematic review of the literature was carried out on the management of diabetic foot ulcer in Malaysia. A modified Delphi panel involving 7 local experts was organized to validate the statements, in order to arrive at a consensus on the resources used for the treatment of DFU patients in Malaysia and their costs. A Markov model was then used to estimate the financial burden of DFU patients in Malaysia.The total cost per patient per annum was MYR 5981 in public and MYR 8581 in private setting. In the public setting, outpatient visits costs represent 50% of the overall cost, followed by medical devices which represent 38% of total costs. In the private setting, as in the public, outpatient visits and devices contribute the most to overall costs with 51% and 21%, respectively. However, hospital inpatient costs are higher in private setting and represent 14% of the total costs versus 5% in public setting.These findings may prove useful for clinicians and decision makers in understanding the economic implications of managing DFUs in Malaysia and the need for innovative therapies to reduce the burden for patients but also for the society.",

    "abstract": "While highly effective for reducing the risk of tuberculosis (TB) disease, TB preventive treatment (TPT) is underused among people living with HIV (PWH). We evaluated the effectiveness of a behavioural economics-based choice architecture approach to increase facility-level TPT prescribing to PWH in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. We conducted a cluster-randomised trial within the IMPAACT4TB 3HP rollout, in which 57 healthcare facilities were randomly assigned 1:1 to choice architecture (intervention) or standard TPT prescribing (control). The aim was to link TPT to antiretroviral therapy (ART) prescribing and to make TPT prescribing the default. The intervention was supported by clinician training and a default prescribing module built into the point-of-care HIV electronic medical record in Malawi and stickers placed in clients' clinical stationery in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Data were collected in aggregate, and the primary outcome was the facility-level percentage of clients initiating ART who initiated TPT. The CAT study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov where it is listed as completed. Implementation occurred from October 2021 to September 2022 in Mozambique (20 facilities), April 2021 to March 2022 in Malawi (19 facilities) and June 2021 to May 2022 in Zimbabwe (18 facilities), for a total of 29 control arm and 28 choice architecture intervention arm facilities, respectively. Comparing control to intervention facilities, mean TPT prescribing to clients initiating ART was 70.9% vs 86.9% in Mozambique (difference: -16.0%; 95% CI: -38.3%, 6.3%; p=0.15), 56.5% vs 55.5% in Malawi (difference: 1.0%; 95%&#x2009;CI: -14.0%, 16.9%; p=0.89) and 56.2% vs 55.9% in Zimbabwe (difference: 0.2%; 95%&#x2009;CI: -25.2%, 25.8%; p=0.98). The choice architecture intervention did not overcome barriers to TPT prescribing. While the intervention may have led to an improvement in TPT prescribing in Mozambique, no differences were observed in the other countries. Further innovation is needed to ensure that all clients initiating ART are either prescribed TPT or started on anti-TB treatment, as appropriate. NCT04466293.",

The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore the factors influencing adolescents' individual decision-making towards COVID-19 vaccination. A systematic review was conducted using Medline, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, and Publicly Available Content Database. Studies on attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of adolescents regarding COVID-19 vaccines were included. The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist was used for quality assessment, followed by thematic synthesis of the included studies. In total, 13 studies were included, revealing 5 key themes: (1) Limited vaccine literacy influences adolescents' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines; (2) Family, peers, and community strongly influence adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine decision-making; (3) Different levels of trust in vaccine providers and governments influence adolescents' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines; (4) Desire to go back to normality influences adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine attitudes towards vaccine acceptancy; (5) Autonomy influences adolescents' COVID-19 vaccine decision-making. The review findings suggest that vaccine acceptance among adolescents could be improved through tailored and accessible vaccine literacy messaging, addressing structural mistrust, and empowering adolescents to make autonomous health decisions that take into account diverse contexts and populations. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024512197, identifier CRD42024512197.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was an emergent syndrome that led to high volumes of critically ill ventilated patients. We explored influences on decision-making regarding management of COVID-19 ARDS mechanical ventilation to identify modifiable factors to improve preparedness for future pandemics. A systematic review and small group interviews informed the development of an international questionnaire (UK, Italy, Germany and Netherlands) on factors influencing COVID-19 ARDS ventilation decision-making in critical care professionals. Participants ranked four themes in order of importance: disease (uncertainties around COVID-19 ARDS), contextual (cognitive strain), environmental (structural logistics) and team factors. Participants also ranked the subthemes within each theme. Thematic analysis was used to derive findings from qualitative data. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Kendall's tau were used for quantitative data analysis. Patient factors (comorbidities, clinical/biochemical parameters) were the most studied influences in the extant literature on decision-making; uncertainty was one of the least studied. 371 critical care professionals responded to the questionnaire. Disease uncertainty (lack of applicable guidelines, unfamiliarity with pathophysiology) was ranked as the most important influence on ventilation decision-making for COVID-19 ARDS across regions, professions and experience levels (p&lt;0.001). Participants expressed underconfidence in their decision-making (median score: 9/20); this was unaffected by experience (p=0.79) or profession (p=0.58). Qualitative findings supported and extended the initial proposed influences, including the impact of team factors (+ve) and resource limitations (-ve) on disease uncertainty. Future pandemic preparedness programmes should target modifiable influences such as information sharing, teamworking and resource limitations to mitigate against the negative influence of uncertainty and thereby improve decision-making overall.",

    "abstract": "Due to the variety of surgical methods, breast cancer patients may face dilemmas regarding decision-making. Web-based decision aids (WDAs) are interactive tools that help patients make informed decisions by meeting their needs both inside and outside the hospital, providing real-time decision assistance, and being more practical and convenient. Although the incidence of breast cancer ranks first among female cancers in China, studies focusing specifically on the use of WDAs in breast cancer patients have not been conducted in the country. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of WDAs on breast cancer patients considering a breast reconstruction. A total of 70 patients with breast cancer were randomized, with 63 completing the whole trial. The control group used paper-based decision aids, which they could use freely in the ward to obtain health information support. The intervention group used web-based decision aids, including decision assessment, decision support, and decision evaluation, which they could use anytime and anywhere on their mobile phones. The study measured decision conflict, preferred decision-making roles, unmet needs, and decision satisfaction at baseline and before and after the intervention. No differences were found in the demographic and clinical features between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had lower scores for the dimensions of decision support and decision effectiveness, decision uncertainty, total score of decision conflict and information needs, work and financial needs, access and continuity of care, coping, sharing and emotional needs, and total score of unmet information needs (P all&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Patients in the intervention group had a higher proportion of active and collaborative roles, higher scores in the information, deliberation, decision, and global satisfaction and confidence dimensions, and a higher total score for decision satisfaction (P all&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). WDAs are a convenient tool for promoting collaborative decision making, satisfying information needs, reducing decision conflict, and improving decision satisfaction. In addition, the development of WDAs avoids the limitations of region and time, and provides sufficient knowledge for patients to improve their medical experience.

    "abstract": "Internet Addiction (IA) among Chinese adolescents is a growing concern that is associated with considerable psychological, social, and academic problems. Although numerous past studies on IA prevalence in China have been conducted, the findings have been mixed. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the pooled IA prevalence among adolescents in China and its associated factors. Both English (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO) and Chinese (Wan Fang, CNKI) databases were systematically searched. Pooled prevalence and study heterogeneity were analyzed using the random effects model, while the factors contributing to prevalence variation were identified using subgroup and meta-regression analyses. A total of 164 studies involving 737,384 adolescents were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled IA prevalence was 10.3&#x202f;% (95&#x202f;% CI: 9.1&#x202f;%-11.7&#x202f;%). In the subgroup analyses, differences in IA prevalence were significantly associated with the assessment tools (Q = 32.8, p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001) and publication years (Q = 20.6, p&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;0.001).

We find that loss-framed messages increase vaccine hesitancy in both France and Italy, with abstract framing contributing to a greater extent than concrete framing. The results also highlight significant gender effects. Contrary to previous studies, women exhibit less hesitancy than men. Furthermore, gender differences in reactions to the framing of the loss are revealed: reading the concrete framing, men become less willing to be vaccinated, whereas women become more hesitant with the abstract framing. To enhance vaccine acceptance, effective communication should consider how different loss-framed messages impact vaccine decision-making differently based on gender.",

However, whether the deficit in value-based decision-making processing is the consistently key mechanisms of NSSI across studies with heterogeneous decision-making tasks remains uncertain. Hence, we reviewed literature on value-based decision-making and its moderating factors in NSSI, and then conducted a meta-analysis on studies in NSSI, specifically with Iowa Gambling Task. In total, 31 studies with 8417 participants aged from 8 to 50 were included in the systematic review of and 8 studies with 657 participants aged from 10 to 37 included in the meta-analysis. We found consistent impairments in value-based decision-making processing among individuals who engage in NSSI. Importantly, age is a significant moderator, with adolescents with NSSI performance worse, exhibiting increased reward sensitivity and preference for immediate rewards compared to other age groups. These results suggest the important role of value-based decision making in NSSI behaviors, especially during the development of adolescents. Our work provides new insights and integrative evidence for decision-making based prevention and intervention of NSSI.",

Also, considerable geographical disparities remain in the neurosurgical workforce distribution. Augmenting and diversifying the neurosurgical workforce requires addressing barriers which deter medical students and unspecialized residents from pursuing a neurosurgical career. Current studies have largely investigated these challenges on a national scale. Investigation into barriers to a neurosurgical career from a global perspective has been limited. Identifying these barriers across high- and low/middle-income countries is critical to recruiting a more robust neurosurgical workforce and reducing global disparities in access to neurosurgical care. We conducted a systematic review to identify perceived barriers encountered by medical students and unspecialized residents to pursuing a neurosurgical career worldwide. We compared studies performed in high- versus low/middle-income countries and identified shared challenges related to gender stereotypes, work-life balance, academic rigor, and financial compensation. Our findings form a basis for formulating global solutions to augment the neurosurgical workforce.",

    "abstract": "To provide an overview of existing interactive web-based educational tools and decision aids for patients with advanced cancer and to evaluate their development process, content, feasibility, usability, and effectiveness. Systematic literature search from inception to November 2023; screening with Covidence software; narrative analysis of results and quality assessment with the SUNDAE checklist. Sixteen web-based tools were identified: Seven for breast cancer, six for other specific cancers, and three for mixed populations. Studies predominantly used literature reviews, focus groups, and/or pre-existing tools for the development. The tools were heterogeneous and not all integrated aspects of end-of-life care. User tests included controlled trials, prospective interventional cohort studies, and a retrospective observational study, involving a total of 6192 patients. Results showed partially low adoption and infrequent use. Feasibility and usability were positively rated with high rates of user satisfaction. Preparation for and involvement in decision-making was partially supported by increased knowledge and improved doctor-patient relationships. Effects on involvement and self-efficacy in decision-making, participation, and distress were uncertain. Effects on quality of life, hope, anxiety, engagement in palliative care/advance directives, and survival were not found. Despite high user satisfaction and adequate feasibility and usability, the evidence for other outcomes is diverse and low for long-term implementation. Tools are very heterogeneous in cancer entities and content. Although targeting patients with advanced cancer not all tools integrate aspects of palliative care and end-of-life. In advanced cancer care, patient involvement in decision-making is complex. Web-based solutions are promising because of easy accessibility and dissemination and the ability to adapt information to patients' needs and new treatment developments. Still, only a few evidence-based web-based educational tools and decision aids are available. Filling this gap is essential to empower patients to make informed and goal-concordant treatment decisions.",

Although there are quality standards, PtDAs are complex interventions with variability in their attributes.PurposeTo determine and compare the effects of PtDA attributes (e.g., content elements, delivery timing, development) on primary outcomes for adults facing health care decisions.Data SourcesA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PtDAs to usual care.Study SelectionEligible RCTs measured at least 1 primary outcome: informed values choice, knowledge, accurate risk perception, decisional conflict subscales, and undecided.Data AnalysisA network meta-analysis evaluated direct and indirect effects of PtDA attributes on primary outcomes.Data SynthesisOf 209 RCTs, 149 reported eligible outcomes. There was no difference in outcomes for PtDAs using implicit compared with explicit values clarification. Compared with PtDAs with probabilities, PtDAs without probabilities were associated with poorer patient knowledge (mean difference [MD] -3.86; 95% credible interval [CrI] -7.67, -0.03); there were no difference for other outcomes. There was no difference in outcomes when PtDAs presented information in ways that decrease cognitive demand and mixed results when PtDAs used strategies to enhance communication.

    "title": "The correlation between mindfulness and problematic smartphone use: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "In the modern era of constant digital technological advancements, problematic smartphone use has become a key issue in educational psychology. This phenomenon affects individual psychological well-being and academic or other performance and encompasses interpersonal relationships and societal aspects, divulging the intricate correlation between technology usage and human behavior. This study aims to explore mindfulness as an intervention measure to lessen problematic smartphone use. Based on the PRISMA method, this study used a meta-analytic approach to explore the relationship between mindfulness and problematic smartphone use systematically. Systematic literature searches for papers published before February 2024 yielded 29 studies, including 17,534 individuals and 30 effect sizes. The sample comprised participants from Eastern cultures (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;22 studies) and Western cultures (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8 studies). The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between mindfulness and problematic smartphone use (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.399, 95&#xa0;% CI [-0.457, -0.338], p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Moderator analyses revealed the strongest relationship when using the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.498), while the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) showed the weakest (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.245). Cultural background analyses indicated stronger effects in Eastern cultures (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.428) compared to Western cultures (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.316). Gender analyses revealed stronger effects among female participants (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.510, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). These findings demonstrate that mindfulness serves as an effective approach to addressing problematic smartphone use. The significant moderating effects identified have important implications for the implementation of mindfulness-based interventions in educational settings.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the correlation between parental affective disorders and four common digital addiction in children and adolescents. The research was conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The meta-analysis included studies focusing on parental affective disorders and digital addiction to the Internet, smartphones, social media, and gaming among children and adolescents, using longitudinal, cohort, or cross-sectional study designs, and reporting correlation effect sizes or other data that could be converted to correlation r. Pooled Pearson's correlations were calculated using the random-effect model. Nineteen studies were included (sample sizes ranged from 104 to 4,385), with ten on gaming addiction, four on smartphone addiction, three on Internet addiction, and two on social media addiction. The meta-analysis revealed a small but significant correlation (pooled r [95&#xa0;%CI]&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.15 [0.11-0.19]) between parental affective disorders and digital addiction in children and adolescents. This correlation was stronger in studies focusing on offspring's smartphone addiction (r [95&#xa0;%CI]&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.25 [0.17, 0.33]), and studies conducted in Asia (r [95&#xa0;%CI]&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.17 [0.12, 0.22]), and increased slightly from 0.09 to 0.10 to 0.15-0.16 by years in 2017 and 2024. Parental affective disorders were positively correlated with offspring's digital addiction, particularly on smartphone addiction and in Asian families. Improving parental mental health as a complementary strategy of clinical treatments might be more effective in reducing digital addiction in offspring. Further research is needed to explore the potential underlying mechanisms to gain a deeper understanding.",

    "title": "Factors influencing patient safety incident reporting in African healthcare organisations: a systematic integrative review.",
    "abstract": "Patient safety incidents, defined as deviations from standard healthcare practices, contribute to significant mortality and financial burdens for healthcare systems globally each year. In response, international agencies advocate for patient safety incident reporting and learning systems to prevent the recurrence of safety incidents and promote learning. The effective design and implementation of these systems require the identification of factors that influence incident reporting practices. Therefore, the aim of this review was to systematically appraise and synthesise the current literature on factors influencing patient safety incident reporting practices in African healthcare organisations. A systematic integrative review was conducted. Five electronic databases, including PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCO host, Scopus, Web of Science, and Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), were searched to identify relevant articles. Peer-reviewed articles published in English were included in this review. Two independent reviewers screened the identified articles first by title and abstract, followed by full text evaluation. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies tool. A thematic synthesis approach was used to analyse the data. The themes were presented with narrative descriptions. A literature search identified 9,265 articles, of which 51 were included in the review, representing the perspectives of 15,089 healthcare professionals. Of the included articles, 88% were rated as moderate to high quality. Five descriptive themes were identified as barriers and facilitators that influenced patient safety incident reporting practices, including fear of reprisal within the prevailing patient safety culture, attitudes and perceptions towards patient safety incident reporting, the extent of knowledge and skills regarding patient safety incidents and reporting, the availability and attributes of reporting systems and processes, and the level of support from managers and rapport with staff. The identified barriers and facilitators influencing patient safety incident reporting should be addressed to effectively design, implement, and improve patient safety incident reporting systems and practices. The review protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42023455168.",

    "title": "An electronic health record-based strategy to increase PrEP decision-making among cisgender women in primary care: results of a randomized pilot study.",
    "abstract": "Approximately one in five HIV infections in the United States occurs among cisgender women, those whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective preventive option for all genders, yet lack of awareness and stigma have hindered uptake. To address this gap, we sought to develop and pilot test an electronic health record-based strategy among cisgender women in primary care. Our strategy, informed by prior work, identified cisgender women in primary care who might benefit from PrEP, provided them with person-centered PrEP educational materials via the patient portal, and offered an opportunity to electronically request a dedicated PrEP visit with a PrEP champion - a female primary care physician - if desired. We conducted two sequential patient-randomized pilot studies to test: (1) the efficacy of the materials compared to usual care, and (2) the preliminary effectiveness of our strategy compared to usual care. The primary outcomes for the efficacy study included PrEP knowledge and PrEP stigma, while the primary outcome for the preliminary effectiveness study was PrEP uptake over a three-month period. In total, we enrolled 200 women. The efficacy study (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50 per arm) revealed our PrEP educational materials significantly increased PrEP knowledge scores among women who were directly shown the materials, compared to those who were not (9.4 (standard deviation (SD) 0.9) vs. 5.8 (SD 1.8) out of 10, p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, respectively). However, the preliminary effectiveness study (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;50 per arm) resulted in no significant differences, other than PrEP awareness, between women randomized to our strategy and those randomized to usual care. PrEP educational materials have the potential to increase PrEP knowledge among cisgender women. For the patient portal to be an effective delivery channel, additional support efforts should be considered.

    "abstract": "To explore the effects of a nurse-led psycho-educational interventions (PEI) on uncertainty in illness, anxiety and sexual functioning among women with gynaecological cancer (GC). An assessor-blinded multicentre randomised controlled trial was conducted in Hong Kong and Hunan, China. The intervention group received a 4-session, 12-week-long nurse-led PEI while the control group received attention on four occasions. The outcomes were measured at baseline and upon completion of the programme. Of the 402 participants recruited, 202 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 200 to the control group. The intervention demonstrated significant effects on ambiguity (Group*Time regression coefficient, B&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;2.13, 95% CI:&#x2009;-&#x2009;3.87 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.38, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017), inconsistency (Group*Time, B&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;1.27, 95% CI:&#x2009;-&#x2009;2.19 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.34, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) and overall uncertainty in illness (Group*Time, B&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;3.27, 95% CI:&#x2009;-&#x2009;6.34 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.20, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037).

    "title": "Is physical therapy recommended for people with parkinson's disease treated with subthalamic deep brain stimulation? a delphi consensus study.",
    "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) induces motor benefits in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), its effect on motor axial symptoms (e.g., postural instability, trunk posture alterations) and gait impairments (e.g., freezing of gait) is still ambiguous. Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. freezing of gait) in the general population with PD. Despite the positive potential of combined PT and STN-DBS surgery, scientific results are still lacking. We therefore involved worldwide leading experts on DBS and motor rehabilitation in PwPD in a consensus Delphi panel to define the current level of PT recommendation following STN-DBS surgery. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic scoping review, we identified clinically and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review, thirty-nine questions were designed and submitted to the panel-half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, and half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality of data, the few available rehabilitation studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture in the population with PD receiving STN-DBS. Similarly, the panellists strongly agreed that PT might help improve motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be prescribed to maximize the effects of stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed that conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy, should be prescribed because of the specificity of STN-DBS implantation. Although RCT evidence is lacking, upon Delphi panel, PT for PwPD receiving STN-DBS can be potentially useful to maximize clinical improvement. However, more research is needed, with RCTs and well-designed studies. The rehabilitation and DBS community should expand this area of research to create guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.",

    "title": "Tibia rotational alignment in total knee arthroplasty: Delphi consensus statements from European Knee Society (EKS).",
    "abstract": "Rotational alignment of the tibial component during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is critical for ensuring optimal tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint function. Proper alignment minimizes the risk of tibiofemoral mismatch and patellofemoral instability, which can lead to increased joint stress and compromised kinematics. Traditionally, the tibial tubercle axis (TTA) has been the primary landmark for alignment. However, recent insights into knee three-dimensional anatomy reveal significant variability in TTA positioning, challenging its reliability. This study employs a Delphi consensus methodology among European Knee Society (EKS) experts to address key questions regarding tibial rotational alignment in TKA. Through a systematic literature review and expert discussions, a strong consensus was achieved on three main points: (1) optimal alignment should target both the perpendicularity of the anteroposterior tibial axis to the femoral flexion/extension axis and the accurate positioning of the tibial tubercle relative to the femoral trochlea; (2) while the TTA is effective in 70% of cases, its variability in 30% of knees necessitates alternative strategies; (3) current computer-assisted and robotic technologies do not significantly enhance alignment outcomes. These findings emphasize the importance of individualized assessment of rotational deformities and highlight the potential of advanced data analytics to improve future alignment strategies. The consensus underscores the complexity of achieving optimal tibial alignment and the need for continued research to refine surgical techniques and technologies.",

    "abstract": "To examine decision-making between healthcare providers (HCPs), older people and their carers in relation to medication management. Four databases were systematically searched up to June 2023. Two authors screened the search results. Extracted quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and qualitative data were analysed thematically. Fifty-three papers reporting on 49 studies were included. A variety of research methods were utilised. Few authors provided a definition of shared decision-making (SDM). Three major themes were identified: provider-driven decision-making, patient-driven decision-making and a shared role in decision-making. Some older people preferred or deferred to provider-driven decision-making, mainly due to trust in the HCP's expertise. Other reasons for provider-driven decision-making were patient anxiety, declining health, lack of medical knowledge or poor communication during the clinical encounter. Evidence of patient-driven decision-making was often prompted by concerns about the adverse effects of medication. Most older people preferred or adopted a shared role in decision-making. Whilst most patients and carers preferred to engage in SDM related to medication management, at times, they felt unable to do so, deferring to provider-driven decision-making. There is a need for a standardised definition and measurement of SDM. This systematic review did not directly involve older people or carers of older people in the design or conduct of the review. However, the findings will inform a qualitative study aimed at exploring older people and their carers' experiences of medication-related decision-making in collaboration with their healthcare provider.

Students who reappraise stress arousal as a functional resource and who adopt approach-oriented achievement goals -focusing on attaining success rather than avoiding failure- may experience healthier biological stress responses and perform better. This study tested whether a short intervention that integrated the stress reappraisal and achievement goal models 1) increased students' exam scores and 2) decreased their stress hormones during their course exams compared to a control condition. Students in an Introduction to Psychology course (N = 308; M<sub>age</sub> = 18.30 years, SD<sub>age</sub> = 0.62 years, 59&#x202f;% Female) were randomly assigned to a short reading-writing intervention or a control condition between their first and second in-class exams. Students provided a saliva sample immediately after each exam to assess the cortisol levels produced while taking the exam, and exam scores were obtained from the course instructor. Results revealed that the intervention increased exam scores and decreased production of salivary cortisol at Exam 2 post-intervention compared to the control intervention. In brief, the short intervention was a successful tool in helping students view their stress responses as additional fuel to focus on the exam and perform.",

    "abstract": "Most Australian women will experience menopause while in paid employment, and many workplaces are introducing menopause-related policies. However, the quality of the evidence for the impact of menopause on women's work outcomes is unclear. To systematically review the published literature that has examined the impact of menopausal status and symptoms on work ability and productivity. A systematic review of English-language peer-reviewed literature. Data sources included Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus databases searched from inception to 14 November 2024, Google Scholar, and reference lists of included articles. Eligible studies included a formal process to identify menopausal status; a robust questionnaire or validated tool for assessing menopausal symptoms; a comparator group by menopausal status, symptom presence or severity; assessment of work outcomes by a validated tool; and a sample size of at least 100 women. Two authors selected the articles for inclusion and extracted the data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the modified Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for cohort studies and the modified Hoy tool for cross-sectional studies. Of the 40 articles retrieved for full-text review, 10 met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies were cross-sectional and one was longitudinal. Menopausal status was not consistently related to work ability. The presence and severity of VMS and other menopause-related symptoms may impact work outcomes, but findings were mixed. A number of adverse employment, socioeconomic, and personal factors were independently associated with lower self-reported work ability in studies that examined such factors. Each included study was limited by a high risk of bias in at least one assessed domain, and only 6 of the studies adjusted for confounders. Heterogeneity in study design and analysis precluded a meta-analysis. Menopausal status alone was not consistently associated with work outcomes. Evidence for an adverse impact of menopausal symptoms on work ability is mixed and may be confounded by other factors impacting on women's work outcomes at midlife.

    "title": "Perceived general obligation: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The literature on psychological contracts has focused on employees' perceptions of their employers' obligations, but not on employees' perceptions of their own obligations. Hence, perceived general obligation has seldom been theorized. This study argues that workplace support (i.e., from the organization, supervisors, and coworkers) and morally relevant traits (i.e., moral identity, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) predict perceived general obligation, that perceived general obligation predicts performance outcomes, and that the effects vary across cultures. Meta-analytic data collected from 148 samples (<i>N</i> = 45,671) provide preliminary support for the proposed relationships. I also examine the incremental validity of perceived general obligation in predicting performance outcomes beyond other correlates (e.g., normative commitment, positive and negative affect), the mediating role of perceived general obligation in its nomological network, and alternative models for linking the study variables. This study therefore illustrates the value of perceived general obligation in psychological contract research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Body cooling is a low-cost heat strain mitigation strategy to effectively reduce heat strain and enhance work performance. However, data on the efficacy of body cooling strategies remains limited. We aimed to examine the effects of body cooling with cooling garments on physiological, perceptual, and performance outcomes during simulated work in the heat in men and women. Fourteen physically active participants (seven men and seven women; age: 26&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3 years, peak oxygen consumption [VO<sub>2</sub>peak]: 42.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.9&#x2009;mL&#x2009;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x2009;min<sup>-1</sup>) completed two randomized control trials in a hot, humid environment (40&#xb0;C, 40% relative humidity). During the body cooling trial (COOL), participants wore cooling garments (hat, sleeves, neck gaiter), and large cooling towels during rest breaks. There was no cooling intervention in the control trial (CON). Rectal temperature (T<sub>REC</sub>), skin temperature (T<sub>SK</sub>), and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously. Performance outcomes included the number of boxes lifted during the trial (BOX) and the time to complete 25 repetitions (TT25) post-trial. There was a significant interaction between trial and activity with COOL reporting overall lower T<sub>REC</sub> (CON: 38.40&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.46&#xb0;C; COOL: 38.08&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.31&#xb0;C; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), T<sub>SK</sub> (CON: 37.20&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.72&#xb0;C; COOL: 35.52&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.52&#xb0;C; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and HR (CON: 145&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;17&#x2009;bpm; COOL: 133&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;24&#x2009;bpm; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

    "title": "Effectiveness of Finnish SISU training in enhancing prehospital personnels' work performance: A randomised controlled pilot study.",
    "abstract": "Resilience means coping with and recovering quickly from adversities. This is a highly beneficial quality for prehospital personnel, who encounter many unforeseen stressors while on duty. This study investigated whether a novel pre-emptive resilience coaching programme, 'Finnish SISU training' (hereafter SISU), based on the validated International Performance Resilience and Efficacy Program (iPREP), would improve the work performance by enhancing situational and decision-making skills of prehospital personnel. 'Sisu' is a Finnish word meaning the combination of toughness and resilience. This randomised controlled pilot study was conducted in P&#xe4;ij&#xe4;t-H&#xe4;me, Finland. The sample comprised 16 paramedics, divided equally between the intervention and control groups. SISU was administered to the intervention group. Three full-scale simulation scenarios were then conducted. A blinded observer evaluated the participants' situational awareness and decision-making skills using a structured observer form, awarding them a maximum of 10 points. Participants completed a self-evaluation form before and after each simulation scenario and the responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The results of these forms were compared between groups. We also compared the median values of heart rate variability (HRV), maximum heart rate, and respiratory rate between the groups. After 16&#xa0;h of pre-emptive SISU, the intervention group improved their situational awareness and decision-making skills in the third simulation scenario (observer form results: intervention group median 10 [IQR 9-10] and control group median 6 [IQR 5-7], p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01). In contrast, observer ratings of the control group showed a diminishing trend in work performance across the three simulation scenarios. Self-evaluation revealed increased confidence in work performance in both study groups, in contrast to the blinded observer findings. Regarding HRV, the intervention group in contrast to the control group, recovered in minutes following the simulation scenarios, especially after the third simulation scenario (third defusing session: intervention group median HRV 27 [IQR 21-28], control group median HRV 21 [IQR 17-22], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). SISU improved work performance, which was measured by situational awareness and decision-making skills under stressful conditions. Resilience, a skill gained from this novel training, may have positive effects on coping with stress. ISRCTN10221308. Registered at 19.3.2024.

    "abstract": "NIDUS-Family is a psychosocial and behavioural intervention comprising six to eight sessions, delivered by non-clinical facilitators, and tailored to goals set by dyads of people with dementia and their unpaid or family carers. The intervention has been shown to be effective for attainment of personalised client goals. The current study aimed to determine whether the intervention is cost-effective. In this cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis within a two-armed, single-masked, multisite, superiority randomised controlled trial, we recruited 302&#xa0;people with dementia living in their own homes and their family carers from National Health Service community settings and social and print media across England. Participants were randomly allocated (2:1) to the NIDUS-Family intervention group or control (goal setting and routine care) group. Randomisation was blocked and site-stratified, with allocation by a remote web-based system. We calculated the probability that NIDUS-Family is cost-effective for a client with dementia based on quality-adjusted life-years from a health and social care perspective and from a societal perspective (additionally including family carer time and out-of-pocket costs), at &#xa3;20&#x2009;000-30&#x2009;000&#xa0;decision thresholds for additional quality-adjusted life-years compared with usual care over 12&#xa0;months. Analyses were done using the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN11425138, and is completed. Between April 30, 2020, and May 9, 2022, we randomly allocated 204&#xa0;participants (109 [53%] women and 95&#xa0;[47%] men) to the intervention group and 98 (60 [61%] women and 38 [39%] men) to the control group. 218 (72%) participants at 6&#xa0;months and 178 (59%) at 12&#xa0;months provided cost data. At both a &#xa3;20&#x2009;000&#xa0;and &#xa3;30&#x2009;000&#xa0;decision threshold, there was an 89% probability that NIDUS-Family was cost-effective compared with usual care from a health and social care perspective, and an 87% probability from a societal perspective. Intervention participants accrued on average &#xa3;8934 (37%) less in costs than control participants (95% CI -&#xa3;59&#x2009;460&#xa0;to &#xa3;41&#x2009;592). NIDUS-Family is the first personalised care and support intervention to show both cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the quality of life of people with dementia as well as clinical effectiveness and should therefore be part of routine dementia care.

    "abstract": "Sustainable development goals and rising sustainability concerns push stakeholders and society to demand organizations adopt innovative practices that can contribute to business sustainability. This study aims to provide a systematic review through comprehensive bibliometric analysis of almost 1st quarter of the 21st century. The main focus is on how green human resource management practices promote and have a relationship with environmental performance, which is a significant part of sustainability. The authors systematically reviewed 242 top-tier articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases by following the \"preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses\" methodology. A significant relationship began in 2015 and gained popularity after COVID-19. The studies suggest that management should embrace the most demanding green human resource management practices, such as green competence building, motivation enhancement, and employee involvement, for better environmental performance. So, organizations can help acquire and retain committed and eco-friendly employees whose ecological values and objectives are compatible with the organization. The study also provides insight into the role of green human resource management practices in fostering eco-friendly behaviour of employees that, in turn, influence environmental performance. Most authors used the theory of ability-motivation-opportunity, a supporting mechanism for how organizations protect the environment through adopting green human resource management practices. In the future, corporate environmental responsibility, environmental regulations intensity, pro-environmental behaviour, and green work-life balance are suggested mechanisms to enhance environmental performance through green human resource management practices.",

    "title": "The relationship between leadership and adaptive performance: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This research presents a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of literature to examine the impact of various leadership styles on organizational adaptive performance (AP). AP is essential for job performance, especially in environments undergoing rapid changes. Previous reviews on AP found that transformational and self-leadership had had a positive influence on job adaptivity, while the relationship between other leadership styles and AP had not been clear. First, authors outlined the theoretical framework of AP and leadership, clarifying how job adaptivity and the different leadership styles are defined and discussed in the scientific literature. Subsequently four scientific databases were explored to identify studies that investigate the Leadership and AP' relationship. 32 scientific articles and 2 conference papers were investigated for review, of which 31 were used to conduct a meta-analysis; 52 different effect sizes from 32 samples were identified for a total sample size of 11.640 people. Qualitative synthesis revealed that the influence of different leadership styles on AP depended on contextual variables and on aspects related to the nature of the work. Moreover, it was found that leadership supported AP through motivational and relational aspects. Through this meta-analysis, it was found that a significant positive relationship between leadership and AP existed (Zr = .39, SE = .04, p &lt; .001. 95%CI [.32, .47], r = .37). However, no differences emerged from the different leadership styles examined in the studies. This review deepens the importance of leadership as organizational factor that affect the employees' likelihood of dealing with continuously emergent changes at work, extended the search to emerging leadership approaches to highlight the value of collective contributions, ethics, and moral and sustainable elements that could positively affect AP.",

    "abstract": "Our team developed <i>Conversation Cards for Adolescents&#xa9;</i> (CCAs), a tool to help adolescents and health care providers (HCPs) communicate and collaboratively set behavior change goals. The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to test the feasibility, user experience, and preliminary effect of using CCAs with adolescents in primary care, focusing on behavior change and collaborative goal setting among adolescents. From March 2019 to September 2022, adolescents were recruited from the Northeast Community Health Centre (Edmonton, AB). Adolescents were randomized (1:1) to one of two groups: CCA&#x2009;+&#x2009;goal setting (experimental group) or goal setting alone (control group). Data were collected from both groups at baseline and at 3-weeks post-baseline. In total, 31 adolescents completed the trial (terminated early due to COVID-19). The study demonstrated high practicality. Adolescents reported positive user experiences with CCAs, citing attractiveness, clarity, efficiency, and dependability. No group differences were detected for behavior changes at 3-weeks post-baseline (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;.05), although adolescents in the experimental group qualitatively described improved rapport and communication with HCPs. CCAs can be used practically in a primary health care setting to facilitate communication and rapport with adolescents; however, their effect in enabling behavior change should be investigated in a multi-site, larger-scale trial.",

There is growing appreciation of the need for socioeconomic factors to be included in multidisciplinary assessments of HS. However, knowledge regarding HS and workplace function is limited. To assess the relationship between HS and workplace function. CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed were systematically searched to collect data from studies in which validated surveys of workplace function were administered to patients with HS. Of 1932 publications, 12 studies were included in this review and 7 reported sufficient data for meta-analysis. The studies included in this review encompassed 5187 patients with HS and no controls. All studies used the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, reporting percentage scores for absenteeism, presenteeism, total work productivity impairment (TWPI) and total activity impairment (TAI). The pooled mean scores for HS were calculated as 10.17% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.68-11.66] for absenteeism, 31.13% (95% CI 25.02-37.23) for presenteeism, 34.25% (95% CI 29.37-39.14) for TWPI and 42.23% (95% CI 38.56-45.89) for TAI. Significant heterogeneity was identified; most studies were of 'poor' to 'fair' quality. Current evidence suggests considerable impairment of workplace functioning in patients with HS. Our findings point to a significant unmet treatment need with respect to improving working capability in HS. The existing literature is inadequate to reliably assess the mechanisms underlying this effect or to comparatively assess the capabilities of HS therapies to improve workplace function.",

    "title": "Family member reported symptom burden, predictors of caregiver burden and treatment effects in a goal-oriented community-based randomized controlled trial in the chronic phase of traumatic brain injury.",
    "abstract": "Family members are often affected by the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury, but are rarely involved in rehabilitation programs in the chronic phase. We thus do not know what family members&#xb4; main concerns are in the chronic phase, what factors are associated with perceived caregiver burden, and whether family members&#xb4; health and functioning improves due to rehabilitation efforts received by the patients. This study explored family-members` functioning, predictors of caregiver burden and effect for family members of a goal-oriented intervention in the chronic phase of traumatic brain injury. Family members self-reported data measuring their caregiver burden, depression, general health, loneliness, and their evaluation of patient competency in everyday life, patient awareness levels, main problem areas (target outcomes) for the patient related to the brain injury, and demographic data were collected. Regression models were used to explore predictors of caregiver burden, and mixed models analysis was used to explore treatment effects. In total, 73 family members were included, 39 in the intervention group and 34 in the control group. Moderate to high caregiver burden was reported by 40% of family members, and 16% experienced clinical levels of depression. Family member loneliness and their evaluation of the patient`s level of functional competency explained 57% of the variability in caregiver burden. There were no treatment-related changes in caregiver burden, family member depression or general health. At T2 there was however a significant reduction in how family members rated severity of target outcomes that the family members had nominated at baseline (-0.38, 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.02, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), but not for the target outcomes the patients had nominated. A significant proportion of family members to patients in the chronic phase of TBI continue to experience challenging caregiver burden and emotional symptoms. Both family member-related and patient factors contribute to caregiver burden. Interventions targeting patient complaints do not automatically alleviate family members&#xb4; burden. It is important to address social support for family members early after injury, and there is a need for more interventions specifically targeting family members&#xb4; needs.

    "abstract": "Working from home has become standard for employees with a university degree. The most common scheme, which has been adopted by around 100&#x2009;million employees in Europe and North America, is a hybrid schedule, in which individuals spend a mix of days at home and at work each week<sup>1,2</sup>. However, the effects of hybrid working on employees and firms have been debated, and some executives argue that it damages productivity, innovation and career development<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we ran a six-month randomized control trial investigating the effects of hybrid working from home on 1,612 employees in a Chinese technology company in 2021-2022. We found that hybrid working improved job satisfaction and reduced quit rates by one-third. The reduction in quit rates was significant for non-managers, female employees and those with long commutes. Null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working did not affect performance grades over the next two years of reviews. We found no evidence for a difference in promotions over the next two years overall, or for any major employee subgroup. Finally, null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working had no effect on the lines of code written by computer-engineer employees. We also found that the 395 managers in the experiment revised their surveyed views about the effect of hybrid working on productivity, from a perceived negative effect (-2.6% on average) before the experiment to a perceived positive one (+1.0%) after the experiment. These results indicate that a hybrid schedule with two days a week working from home does not damage performance.",

    "abstract": "It is well documented that public safety personnel are exposed to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) at elevated frequency and demonstrate higher prevalence of trauma-related symptoms compared to the general population. Lesser studied to date are the organizational consequences of workplace PTE exposure and associated mental health outcomes such as acute/posttraumatic stress disorder (ASD/PTSD), depression, and anxiety. The present review synthesizes international literature on work outcomes in public safety personnel (PSP) to explore whether and how PTE and trauma-related symptoms relate to workplace outcomes. A total of N&#x2009;=&#x2009;55 eligible articles examining PTE or trauma-related symptoms in relation to work outcomes were systematically reviewed using best-evidence narrative synthesis. Three primary work outcomes emerged across the literature: absenteeism, productivity/performance, and costs to organization. Across n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21 studies of absenteeism, there was strong evidence that PTE or trauma-related symptoms are associated with increased sickness absence. N&#x2009;=&#x2009;27 studies on productivity/performance demonstrated overall strong evidence of negative impacts in the workplace. N&#x2009;=&#x2009;7 studies on cost to organizations demonstrated weak evidence that PTE exposure or trauma-related mental health outcomes are associated with increased cost to organization. Based on available evidence, the experience of workplace PTE or trauma-related symptoms is associated with negative impact on PSP occupational functioning, though important potential confounds (e.g., organizational strain and individual risk factors) remain to be more extensively investigated.",

A single centre randomised controlled trial. Sapporo Medical University Hospital. A total of 64 adults patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to either group receiving conventional goal-directed therapy (FloTrac group) or combination of the hypotension prediction index and conventional goal-directed therapy (HPI group). To investigate the independent utility of the index, the peak rates of arterial pressure and dynamic arterial elastance were not included in the treatment algorithm for the HPI group. The primary outcome was the time-weighted average of the areas under the threshold. Secondary outcomes were area under the threshold, the number of hypotension events, total duration of hypotension events, mean mean arterial pressure during the hypotension period, number of hypotension events with mean arterial pressure&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;50&#xa0;mmHg, amounts of fluids, blood products, blood loss, and urine output, frequency and amount of vasoactive agents, concentration of haemoglobin during the monitoring period, and 30-day mortality.

No significant differences were observed in the volumes of fluid and blood products between the study groups. The current randomised controlled trial results suggest that using the hypotension prediction index independently lowered the cumulative amount of intraoperative hypotension during major non-cardiac surgery.",

The primary aim of this randomized trial was to examine the impact of a verbalized time goal on the likelihood of meeting institutional goals. This is a prospective, single-blind, randomized study conducted across four operative sites: inpatient main campus and three outpatient centers. Sequential cases for the same surgeon in the same room were randomized to receive a verbal prompt versus usual care, in which no goal setting was verbalized. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were performed. From July through October 2022, five attending surgeons randomized 88 cases (44 verbal prompt, 44 usual care). Of these, 30 were at the main inpatient hospital. The case mixture included 36% vaginal, 27% endoscopy, 8% open, 10% robotic, and others. Average turnover time was 51.7 and 35.3 min for inpatient and outpatient cases respectively. Overall, only 39.8% of cases hit the institutional turnover time goal. Verbal prompting did not significantly increase the likelihood of achieving the institutional goal (38.4% vs 43.4% p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.352) except for in minor surgery (64.0 vs 39.0%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0477). A verbal prompt reduced turnover time in major surgery (59.7 vs 47.8&#xa0;min, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0445). Our academic center achieved goal turnover times in only 39.8% of cases. Although verbal prompting did not significantly improve the likelihood of meeting institutional goals in the group as a whole, some subgroups were significantly improved.",

    "abstract": "The Financial Incentives for Weight Reduction (FIReWoRk) clinical trial showed that financial incentive weight-loss strategies designed using behavioral economics were more effective than provision of weight-management resources only. We now evaluate cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analysis of a multisite randomized trial enrolling 668 participants with obesity living in low-income neighborhoods. Participants were randomized to (1) goal-directed incentives (targeting behavioral goals), (2) outcome-based incentives (targeting weight-loss), and (3) resources only, which were provided to all participants and included a 1-year commercial weight-loss program membership, wearable activity monitor, food journal, and digital scale. We assessed program costs, time costs, quality of life, weight, and incremental cost-effectiveness in dollars-per-kilogram lost. Mean program costs at 12 months, based on weight loss program attendance, physical activity participation, food diary use, self-monitoring of weight, and incentive payments was $1271 in the goal-directed group, $1194 in the outcome-based group, and $834 in the resources-only group (difference, $437 [95% CI, 398 to 462] and $360 [95% CI, 341-363] for goal-directed or outcome-based vs resources-only, respectively; difference, $77 [95% CI, 58-130] for goal-directed vs outcome-based group). Quality of life did not differ significantly between the groups, but weight loss was substantially greater in the incentive groups (difference, 2.34&#x2009;kg [95% CI, 0.53-4.14] and 1.79&#x2009;kg [95% CI, -0.14 to 3.72] for goal-directed or outcome-based vs resources only, respectively; difference, 0.54&#x2009;kg [95% CI, -1.29 to 2.38] for goal-directed vs outcome-based). Cost-effectiveness of incentive strategies based on program costs was $189/kg lost in the goal-directed group (95% CI, $124/kg to $383/kg) and $186/kg lost in the outcome-based group (95% CI, $113/kg to $530/kg). Goal-directed and outcome-based financial incentives were cost-effective strategies for helping low-income individuals with obesity lose weight. Their incremental cost per kilogram lost were comparable to other weight loss interventions.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether trigger point acupuncture (TrPA) is beneficial for office workers who have reduced job performance (presenteeism) due to chronic neck and shoulder pain (katakori). A 4-week single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted on 20 eligible female office workers with chronic neck and shoulder pain of at least 3-month duration. The control group implemented only workplace-recommended presenteeism measures, whereas the intervention group received TrPA up to 4 times per month in addition to the presenteeism measures recommended by each workplace. The major outcome measure was the relative presenteeism score on the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance (WHO-HPQ). The secondary outcome measures were pain intensity (numerical rating scale), absolute presenteeism (WHO-HPQ), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS), catastrophic thoughts related to pain (Pain Catastrophizing Scale; PCS), and sleep (Athens Insomnia Scale; AIS). All 9 cases in the intervention group and 11 cases in the control group were analyzed. TrPA up to 4 times per month reduced the intensity of neck and shoulder pain by 20% (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.01, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.65) and improved labor productivity (relative presenteeism value) by 0.25 (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.01, d&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33) compared with the control group over 1&#x2005;month. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of absolute presenteeism score, HADS, PCS, or AIS. These results suggest that regular intervention with TrPA may be effective in the relative presenteeism score before and after the intervention and the degree of neck and shoulder pain over 28&#xa0;days compared with the control group.",

    "title": "Type of goals set and progress towards these goals, as part of a behaviour change intervention, in people with mild cognitive impairment: a secondary analysis.",
    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects 5-20% of older people in the UK, but often goes undiagnosed and is associated with increased risk of dementia. Targeting risk factors such as physical inactivity and social isolation through behaviour-change interventions could reduce this risk. However, it is unclear how MCI impacts engagement with these interventions. We aimed to explore how MCI affects goal-setting priorities and progress towards these goals in a behaviour-change intervention (HomeHealth). This was a secondary analysis of a completed randomised controlled trial, HomeHealth, which started in January 2021 and recruited 386 participants aged 65 years and older with mild frailty according to the Clinical Frailty Scale from general practices and the community in England. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either the HomeHealth intervention (n=195) or treatment as usual (n=191) for 6 months. An evidence-based behaviour change intervention supported older people to work on goals to maintain independence, addressing factors affecting capability, opportunity, and motivation. Goal setting and progress information was available for 167 (86%) of 195 participants who received the intervention. The type of goal set and goal progress (scale 0-2) were compared between participants with healthy cognition, those with potential MCI, and those with probable dementia (rated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]). Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted between Aug 16, 2022, and May 18, 2023, with 29 people with MCI who received the intervention, to explore the perceived impact of MCI on goal setting, progress, and maintenance. Data were analysed using codebook thematic analysis. The mean age of participants was 80&#xb7;8 years, 105 (63%) of 167 were women and 158 (95%) were white. 54 (32%) of 167 participants had healthy cognition, 94 (56%) had potential MCI, and 19 (11%) probable dementia. Distribution of goal type was similar across the three groups, with most participants setting mobility goals. Progress towards goals (scale 0-2) was similar in people with healthy cognition and potential MCI (1&#xb7;24 and 1&#xb7;18, respectively) but lower in those with probable dementia (0&#xb7;76). However, all met the moderate progress cutoff (0&#xb7;66-1&#xb7;32). People with MCI recognised their cognition was getting worse but did not feel the HomeHealth intervention could help. Rather than setting new goals, people with MCI built on existing behaviours. Many did not initially understand the intervention and felt they would have benefitted from contact in between sessions or from more sessions to help goal progress. Once the sessions ended, less than a quarter of participants maintained the goal progress. Interventions to help older adults age well can be successfully delivered in people with MCI, to help them set and make progress towards goals. However, to maintain changes, more intense support is needed. National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research, NIHR Health Technology Assessment.",

    "abstract": "Frailty is a condition resulting from a decline in physiological reserves caused by an accumulation of several deficits, which progressively impairs the ability to recover from health adverse events. Following a promising feasibility study, the HomeHealth trial assessed a holistic tailored intervention for older adults with mild frailty to promote independence in their own homes, compared with usual care. We aimed to understand how goal setting worked among older people with mild frailty. This study was a process evaluation alongside the HomeHealth randomised trial in older adults with mild frailty. The intervention was delivered at participants' homes, either in person or by telephone or videoconferencing. We carried out semi-structured interviews with older participants who had received the intervention (between three and six appointments), on average 233 days (range 68-465) after their last appointment, purposively sampled according to age, gender, number of sessions attended, adverse events, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Barthel scores, research site, and HomeHealth worker. We also conducted interviews with HomeHealth workers who delivered the intervention (n=7). Interviews explored the experience and process of goal setting, benefits and challenges, perceived progress, and behaviour change maintenance after the service had finished. Ethics approval was obtained, and all participants gave informed consent. Interviews were thematically analysed. HomeHealth workers kept formal records of goals set and assessed progress towards goals (0-2 rating scale) during six monthly-sessions, which were descriptively summarised. 56 interviews were completed between July 15, 2022, and May 18, 2023. Study participants (n=49) had a mean age of 80 years (range 66-94), including 32 (65%) women and 17 (35%) men. Participants self-identified as White (n=42), Asian (n=3), Black (n=2), Mixed (n=1), and other ethnic (n=1) backgrounds. Findings suggested goal setting could be both a challenge and a motivator for older participants with mild frailty. Goal setting worked well when the older person could identify a clear need and set realistic goals linked to functioning, which led to a positive sense of achievement. Challenges occurred when older people were already accessing multiple resources and health services, or where the terminology of \"goals\" was off-putting due to work or school connotations. Average progress towards goals was 1&#xb7;15/2. Most participants set goals around improving mobility (or a combination of mobility and another goal type such as socialising), and there was evidence of participants sustaining these behaviour changes after the intervention. Older people with mild frailty can engage well with goal setting to promote independence. The lapse between receiving the intervention and being interviewed limited recall for some participants. However, the acceptability and adherence to the intervention for older people with mild frailty, and their moderate progress towards goals, should encourage further tailored and person-centred practices to promote their independence.

    "abstract": "The work environment plays a crucial role in the health and performance of employees. The growing interest in workers' well-being has driven the inclusion of nature in workplaces, despite many employees spending most of their time indoors, away from nature. Studies show that biophilic design in offices can have positive effects and promote workers' well-being. However, research on the beneficial effects of nature exposure in the workplace is limited and scattered. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to consolidate current knowledge on the restorative effects of nature exposure on workers during work activities. Different types of exposure, both outdoors and indoors, were considered, with a focus on outcomes related to well-being, motivation, job satisfaction, and work performance. Out of the initially identified 1225 articles, only 16 met the criteria for analysis. Although the analysed studies provided compelling evidence regarding the restorative effects of nature exposure in the workplace, the review also points out gaps and limitations concerning the number of specific studies in this area and the need to adequately assess the sensory dimensions involved in these effects. Conducting more comprehensive and multidimensional investigations into the impacts of nature on the work environment could contribute to guiding more effective design strategies and creating healthier and more productive workplaces for employees.",

    "abstract": "Menopausal symptoms are known to affect quality of life and work productivity. This systematic review aimed to describe the range and effectiveness of workplace-based interventions for menopause. MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EconLit, and SCOPUS were searched from the inception until April 2022. Quantitative interventional studies evaluating physical/virtual workplace-based interventions aiming to improve well-being, work, and other outcomes, that involved women in menopausal transition, or their line managers/supervisors were eligible for inclusion. Two randomized controlled trials and three uncontrolled trials, comprising 293 women aged 40-60 years and 61, line managers/supervisors, were included in the review. Results were narratively synthesized due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes and we found that only a limited range of interventions have been evaluated for their ability to support women going through menopausal transition in the workplace. Self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); Raja yoga; and health promotion (involving menopause consultations, work-life coaching and physical training) improved menopausal symptoms significantly. Self-help CBT was associated with a significant improvement in mental resources for work, presenteeism, and work and social adjustment. Awareness programs significantly improved knowledge and attitudes of both employees and line managers/supervisors about menopause. The interventions have mostly been evaluated in small studies with selected populations but have improved menopausal symptoms and work outcomes. A customizable menopause wellbeing intervention package incorporating these evidence-supported interventions should be developed and implemented on a wider scale within organizations alongside robust evaluation of its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Neck pain is common among office workers and leads to work productivity loss. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a multi-component intervention on neck pain-related work productivity loss among Swiss office workers. Methods Office workers, aged 18-65&#xa0;years, and without serious neck-related health problems were recruited from two organisations for our stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. The 12-week multi-component intervention included neck exercises, health-promotion information, and workplace ergonomics. The primary outcome of neck pain-related work productivity loss was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire and expressed as percentages of working time. In addition, we reported the weekly monetary value of neck pain-related work productivity loss. Data was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using a generalized linear mixed-effects model. Results Data from 120 participants were analysed with 517 observations. At baseline, the mean age was 43.7&#xa0;years (SD 9.8&#xa0;years), 71.7% of participants were female (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;86), about 80% (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;95) reported mild to moderate neck pain, and neck pain-related work productivity loss was 12% of working time (absenteeism: 1.2%, presenteeism: 10.8%). We found an effect of our multi-component intervention on neck pain-related work productivity loss, with a marginal predicted mean reduction of 2.8 percentage points (b&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.27; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.001, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049).

Behavioral-economic approaches may improve the incentivization effectiveness. This study compares and ranks the effectiveness of standard and behavioral incentivization for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity promotion. To investigate whether behavioral-economic insights improve incentivization effectiveness. A systematic search of Medline and Scopus was performed from database inception to December 2020. Study characteristics, program designs, and risk ratio (RR) were extracted. A two-stage network meta-analysis pooled and ranked intervention effects. There were 35 eligible RCTs. For diet-weight control, standard FI, deposit contract (deposit), lottery-based incentive (lottery), and standard-FI + lottery increased goal achievement compared to no-FI but only deposit was statistically significant with pooled RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.21 (0.94, 1.56), 1.79 (1.04, 3.05), 1.45 (0.99, 2.13), and 1.73 (0.83, 3.63). For physical activity, standard-FI, deposit, and lottery significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.38 (1.13, 1.68), 1.63 (1.24, 2.14) and 1.43 (1.14, 1.80), respectively. In a follow-up period for physical activity, only deposit significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.39 (1.11, 1.73). Deposit, followed by lottery, were best for motivating healthy diet, weight control and physical activity at program end. Post-intervention, deposit then standard-FI were best for motivating physical activity. Behavioral insights can improve incentivization effectiveness, although lottery-based approaches may offer only short-term benefit regarding physical activity. However, the imprecise intervention effects were major concerns. Healthy diet, weight control and physical activity to reduce obesity can be motivated by financial incentives (FI). Behavioral-economic approaches may improve the effectiveness of FI programs. This study aims to investigate whether behavioral-economic insights improve incentivization effectiveness for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity promotion. We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), then pooled the interested results, compared and ranked the effectiveness of standard and behavioral incentivization programs by a two-stage network meta-analysis. There were 35 eligible RCTs. For diet-weight control, standard FI, deposit contract (deposit), lottery-based incentive (lottery), and standard-FI + lottery increased goal achievement compared to no-FI but only deposit was statistically significant. For physical activity, standard-FI, deposit, and lottery significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI. In a follow-up period for physical activity, only deposit significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI. In conclusion, deposit, followed by lottery, were best for motivating healthy diet, weight control and physical activity at program end. Post-intervention, deposit then standard-FI were best for motivating physical activity.

In this post-hoc analysis, we assessed reliability, validity, responsiveness, and meaningful within-patient change from baseline to Month 3 for Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) domain scores in patients with episodic migraine (EM) or chronic migraine (CM). The Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CONQUER study (NCT03559257, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;462) enrolled patients with EM or CM who failed two to four categories of prior preventive medication in past ten years. The analyses were performed for WPAI domain scores (absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work productivity, and non-work-related activity impairment). Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQv2.1) domain scores (Role Function-Restrictive [RFR] and Role Function-Preventive [RFP]), and monthly migraine headache days were used as anchors. Responder criteria were changes from baseline to Month 3 for each of these anchors and were defined as: increase in MSQ-RFR by &#x2265;&#x2009;25.71 points and MSQ-RFP by &#x2265;&#x2009;20.00 points and a 50% reduction in monthly migraine headache days. Assessments were performed for overall population, and patients with EM or CM. The meaningful change threshold was determined based on Youden index, Phi coefficient and sensitivity. Of 462 randomized patients, 444 who completed WPAI questionnaire were included in post-hoc analysis. Test-retest reliability over 3&#xa0;months in a stable subgroup revealed moderate correlations for non-work-related Activity Impairment (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.446) presenteeism (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.438) and a fair correlation for overall work productivity loss (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.360). At baseline, all correlations between WPAI domain scores and continuous anchor variables exceeded recommended threshold of &#x2265;&#x2009;0.30, except for WPAI domain scores with number of monthly migraine headache days. Patients achieving pre-specified responsiveness thresholds for monthly migraine headache days, and MSQ-RFP, MSQ-RFR from baseline to Month 3 (responders) showed significant improvements in WPAI domain scores compared with non-responders (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The meaningful change thresholds of -20 (% unit) were identified for WPAI domain scores. In conclusion, WPAI has sufficient validity, reliability, responsiveness, and appropriate interpretation standards to assess the impact of EM or CM on presenteeism and overall work productivity loss and non-work-related activity impairment.

This article aimed to study the effect of combining plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) with stroke volume variation (SVV) as a target for intraoperative GDT for postoperative pulmonary complications in older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. In this study, older patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;100) undergoing radical resection of gastroenteric tumors were randomized to three groups: Group C (n1&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) received a conventional infusion regimen, Group S1 (n2&#x2009;=&#x2009;34) received GDT based on SVV, and Group S2 (n3&#x2009;=&#x2009;35) received GDT based on SVV and COP. The results were recorded, including the lung injury score (LIS); PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio; lactic acid value at the times of beginning (T0) and 1&#xa0;h (T1), 2&#xa0;h (T2), and 3&#xa0;h (T3) after liquid infusion in the operation room; the total liquid infusion volume; infusion volumes of crystalline and colloidal liquids; urine production rate; pulmonary complications 7&#xa0;days after surgery; and&#xa0;the severity grading&#xa0;of postoperative pulmonary complications. The patients in the S2 group had fewer postoperative pulmonary complications than those in the C group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and&#xa0;the proportion of pulmonary complications of grade 1 and higher than grade 2 in S2&#xa0;group&#xa0;was significantly lower than that in C group (P&#x2009;&lt;0.05); the patients in the S2 group had a higher PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio than those in the C group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), lower LIS than those in the S1 and C groups (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), less total liquid infusion than those in the C group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and more colloidal fluid infusion than those in the S1 and C groups (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

    "title": "Exploring the use of an under-desk leg swing device during employee aptitude testing and implications on work performance and productivity.",
    "abstract": "As modern occupations become more sedentary, desk-bound workers are more at risk of chronic diseases. Active workstations have gained popularity in the workplace, but there remain concerns about their impact on cognitive function. This study investigated the use of a novel under-desk leg swing device on cognitive ability in the workplace compared to sitting. Cognitive ability was measured using a pre-employment aptitude test (CCAT), and perceived outcomes were analyzed via self-report questionnaires. Using a randomized, repeated measures crossover design, 18 undergraduate students undertook the CCAT while using the under-desk leg swing device and while sitting only (Experiment 1). 9 students returned two to three weeks later to repeat testing (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, CCAT scores did not differ significantly between the under-desk leg swing device and sitting (mean difference (MD)&#x200a;=&#x200a;-1.056, standard error (SE)&#x200a;=&#x200a;1.302,p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.429, d&#x200a;=&#x200a;-0.16). Effect sizes of 0.554 were observed for perceived alertness, 0.446 for attention, 0.446 for focus, and 0.564 for enjoyment, but there were no significant differences between the two conditions. CCAT scores were significantly higher in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 (MD&#x200a;=&#x200a;8.444, SE&#x200a;=&#x200a;2.410,p&#x200a;=&#x200a;0.008, d&#x200a;=&#x200a;1.64). Based on Experiment 1, the findings suggest that the use of the under-desk leg swing device promotes movement without detriment to neither workflow nor cognitive ability relevant to employee aptitude compared to sitting.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Goal-Directed and Outcome-Based Financial Incentives for Weight Loss in Primary Care Patients With Obesity Living in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Neighborhoods: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Financial incentives for weight management may increase use of evidence-based strategies while addressing obesity-related economic disparities in low-income populations. To examine the effects of 2 financial incentive strategies developed using behavioral economic theory when added to provision of weight management resources. Three-group, randomized clinical trial conducted from November 2017 to May 2021 at 3 hospital-based clinics in New York City, New York, and Los Angeles, California. A total of 1280 adults with obesity living in low-income neighborhoods were invited to participate, and 668 were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to goal-directed incentives, outcome-based incentives, or a resources-only group. The resources-only group participants were given a 1-year commercial weight-loss program membership, self-monitoring tools (digital scale, food journal, and physical activity monitor), health education, and monthly one-on-one check-in visits. The goal-directed group included resources and linked financial incentives to evidence-based weight-loss behaviors. The outcome-based arm included resources and linked financial incentives to percentage of weight loss. Participants in the incentive groups could earn up to $750. Proportion of patients achieving 5% or greater weight loss at 6 months. The mean (SD) age of the 668 participants enrolled was 47.7 (12.4) years; 541 (81.0%) were women, 485 (72.6%) were Hispanic, and 99 (14.8%) were Black. The mean (SD) weight at enrollment was 98.96 (20.54) kg, and the mean body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 37.95 (6.55). At 6 months, the adjusted proportion of patients who lost at least 5% of baseline weight was 22.1% in the resources-only group, 39.0% in the goal-directed group, and 49.1% in the outcome-based incentive group (difference, 10.08 percentage points [95% CI, 1.31-18.85] for outcome based vs goal directed; difference, 27.03 percentage points [95% CI, 18.20-35.86] and 16.95 percentage points [95% CI, 8.18-25.72] for outcome based or goal directed vs resources only, respectively). However, mean percentage of weight loss was similar in the incentive arms. Mean earned incentives was $440.44 in the goal-directed group and $303.56 in the outcome-based group, but incentives did not improve financial well-being. In this randomized clinical trial, outcome-based and goal-directed financial incentives were similarly effective, and both strategies were more effective than providing resources only for clinically significant weight loss in low-income populations with obesity. Future studies should evaluate cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03157713.",

    "title": "Interventions Into Reliability-Seeking Health Care Organizations: A Systematic Review of Their Goals and Measuring Methods.",
    "abstract": "Within the last 2 decades, numerous interventions making use of high-reliability theory have been implemented to increase reliability in healthcare organizations. This systematic literature review first explores the concrete goals on which such interventions focus. Second, the review captures how the achievement of these goals, or alternatively a change, generally an increase in organizational reliability, is measured across different contexts. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, Business SourcePremier, CINAHL, Communication Source, EconLit, ERIC, Medline, Political Science Complete, PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, PSYNDEX, SocINDEX (via the resource hosterEbscoHost), and Web of Science (through November 22, 2021). Peer-reviewed, English language studies were included, reporting on the implementation of a concrete intervention to increase reliability in a medical context and referring to high-reliability theory. The search first yielded 8896 references, from which 75 studies were included in the final sample. Important healthcare goals stated by the seminal report \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" guided the analysis of the included studies. Most of the studies originated from the United States and report on interventions to increase reliability of either organizational units or whole organizations when aiming for safety (n = 65). Other goals reported on include effectiveness, and much less frequently timeliness, patient centeredness, and efficiency. Fifty-eight studies use quantitative measurement exclusively to account for the achievement of these goals; 7 studies use qualitative measurement exclusively, and 10 studies use a mixed-method approach. The operationalization of goals, including the operationalization of organizational reliability, and measurement methods do not follow a unified approach, despite claiming to be informed by a coherent theory. Instead, such operationalizations strongly depend on the overall objective of the study and the respective context. Measuring the outcomes of high-reliability interventions into healthcare organizations is challenging for different reasons, including the difficult operationalization of partly overlapping goals, the complex, processual nature of achieving reliability, and the limited ability of organizations striving for more reliability if they are already performing on a high level. This review critically assesses the adoption of the goals stated in the seminal report \"Crossing the Quality Chasm\" and provides insights for organizations and funding providers that strive to evaluate more reliable service provision.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Healthcare workers' work performance and mental health are associated with positive mental health outcomes and directly related to increased productivity and decreased disability costs. Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify factors associated with work performance of healthcare workers during a pandemic and conducted a meta-analysis of the prevalence of mental health outcomes in this context. Primary papers were collected and analysed using the Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome framework and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. To critically appraise the studies included in the review, we used the AXIS appraisal tool to assess each cross-sectional study's quality. Results The study identified nine factors associated with the work performance and mental health of healthcare workers, including experiencing feelings of depression, anxiety, having inadequate support, experiencing occupational stress, decreased productivity, lack of workplace preparedness, financial concerns associated with changes in income and daily living, fear of transmission and burnout/fatigue. Conclusion There is a rapidly rising need to address the work performance and mental health of healthcare workers providing timely care to patients. Regular and sustained interventions, including the use of information and communication technologies such as telehealth, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Neck- and back- pain are highly prevalent conditions in Sweden and world-wide. Such pain often has consequences on everyday activities, work- and personal life. One consequence is work absence and decreased productivity at work. Adding a workplace dialogue to structured physiotherapy was recently found to lead to increased workability, i.e., not being on sick leave during the 12<sup>th</sup> month of follow up. The aim of the study was to explore&#xa0;the effect of a workplace dialogue intervention on secondary outcomes: perceived impact of neck and/or back pain on everyday activities and on performance at work, and total days of sick leave during 12&#xa0;month follow up. A further aim was to examine associations between perceived influence of pain, and sick leave. Patients with neck and/or back pain in primary care in the south of Sweden were randomized into structured physiotherapy alone (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;206) or with the addition of a workplace dialogue (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;146). Data regarding the pain's influence on everyday activities and on performance at work were collected using weekly text messages for 52&#xa0;weeks. The pattern of change in perceived influence of neck and/or back pain on everyday activities and performance at work was compared between the groups with linear mixed models. Cross sectional correlations between perceived influence of neck and/or back pain on everyday activities and performance at work, and days of sick leave, during the preceding four weeks at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 were examined. We found no differences in change of perceived influence of neck and/or back pain on daily activities or perceived performance at work, or total days of sick leave during the 12&#xa0;months of follow up between the groups with structured physiotherapy with or without a workplace dialogue. There was a weak to moderate positive correlation between days of sick leave and perceived influence of neck and/or back pain on everyday activities and performance at work (rho 0.28-0.47). A workplace dialogue was not found to affect the perceived impact of neck and/or back pain on everyday activities and performance at work. ClinicalTrials.gov ID:&#xa0; NCT02609750 .",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine levels of health insurance coverage in low- and middle-income countries and how coverage varies by people's sociodemographic characteristics. We conducted a population size-weighted, one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of health insurance coverage, using a population-based sample of 2,035,401 participants ages 15-59 from nationally representative household surveys in fifty-six countries during the period 2006-18. One in five people (20.3&#xa0;percent) across the fifty-six countries in our study had health insurance. Health insurance coverage exceeded 50&#xa0;percent in only seven countries and 70&#xa0;percent in only three countries. Substantially more people had public health insurance than private health insurance (71.4&#xa0;percent versus 28.6&#xa0;percent). We found that men and older, more educated, and wealthier people were more likely to have health insurance; these sociodemographic gradients in health insurance coverage were strongest in sub-Saharan Africa and followed traditional lines of privilege. Low- and middle-income countries need to massively expand health insurance coverage if they intend to use insurance to achieve universal health coverage.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) reduces complications in patients undergoing major general surgery. There are no reports of cardiac output evaluation being used to optimise the fluid administration for patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in a general surgery ward. 50 patients with AP were randomised to either ward-based GDFT (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25) with intravenous (IV) fluids administered based on stroke volume optimisation protocol or standard care (SC) (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;25), but with blinded cardiac output evaluation, for 48-h following hospital admission. Primary outcome was feasibility. 50 of 116 eligible patients (43.1%) were recruited over 20 months demonstrating feasibility. 36 (72%) completed the 48-h of GDFT; 10 (20%) discharged within 48-h and 4 withdrawals (3 GDFT, 1 SC). Baseline characteristics were similar with only 3 participants having severe disease (6%, 1 GDFT, 2 SC). Similar volumes of IV fluids were administered in both groups (GDFT 5465 (1839) ml, SC 5211 (1745) ml). GDFT group had a lower heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate and improved oxygen saturations. GDFT was not associated with any harms. There was no evidence of difference in complications of AP (GDFT 24%, SC 32%) or in the duration of stay in intensive care (GDFT 0 (0), SC 0.7 (3) days). Length of hospital stay was 5 (2.9) days in GDFT and 6.3 (7.6) in SC groups. Ward-based GDFT is feasible and shows a signal of possible efficacy in AP in this early-stage study. A larger multi-site RCT is required to confirm clinical and cost effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Sedentary behavior negatively impacts mental health, which can decrease employee productivity. Employee mental well-being and work performance may improve with sedentary reduction interventions, especially strategies that include environmental workplace modifications and behavior-changing strategies. However, such interventions have not been examined among employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the Stand Up Kansas program, 95 sedentary university employees working from home were randomized into one of four intervention arms: height-adjustable desk provision (Desk Only), online sedentary behavior modification program (Program Only), Desk + Program, or Control. The outcomes were measured at a baseline (November 2020) and following the 12-week intervention (February 2021). Employees reported mood (positive and negative affect), stress, fatigue (duration, interference with activities and severity) and work performance (irritability, focus, work satisfaction, non-work satisfaction and productivity) were measured using established self-report instruments. The effect sizes, by comparing the Control arm to the Desk + Program arm, revealed large improvements in mood (positive affect, <i>d</i> = 1.106). Moderate improvements were also seen in fatigue (duration, <i>d</i> = -0.533, and interference with activities, <i>d</i> = -0.648) and several aspects of work performance (focus, <i>d</i> = 0.702, work satisfaction, <i>d</i> = 0.751, and productivity, <i>d</i> = 0.572). Moderate effect sizes were also seen for positive affect (<i>d</i> = 0.566) and fatigue severity (<i>d</i> = 0.577) among the Program Only arm, whereas no noteworthy effect sizes were observed among the Desk Only arm. Combining an online sedentary behavior modification program with height-adjustable desk provisions appeared to positively affect mental well-being and work performance among remote employees.",

    "abstract": "The formation of dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children, and is preventable. The oral health-related quality of life has an immense impact on an individual's daily functioning, well-being or overall quality of life. This study aims to investigate the cost effectiveness of the Dental RECUR Brief Negotiated Interview for Oral Health (DR-BNI). This 30-minute therapeutic \"talk\" by a dental nurse with a parent/guardian was compared with a placebo-controlled intervention in preventing reoccurrence of dental caries in children who have had a primary tooth extracted. An economic model was developed to simulate the clinical progression of dental caries among children who have previously had a primary tooth extracted. The analysis was conducted using the UK NHS perspective. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Estimates of costs and probabilities were obtained from the DR-BNI multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), while QALY values were obtained from published literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the result and robustness of the model. Affordability and risk-aversion of the intervention were investigated to help decision makers make the best possible choices. With an intervention cost of &#xa3;6.47, the results from the RCT showed the healthcare cost for the DR-BNI intervention was &#xa3;115.90 per child while the control had a healthcare cost of &#xa3;119.46 per child. The QALYs gained for the prevention of reoccurrence of dental caries was higher in the DR-BNI intervention arm by 0.023 QALYs; thus, the DR-BNI was the dominant intervention. At willingness to pay threshold of &#xa3;3500/QALY gained, a maximum probability of being cost effectiveness is achieved at 86%. The secondary analysis showed a cost-savings of &#xa3;20.94 per participant for the prevention of at least one filling or extraction. Affordability results showed that the DR-BNI programme is affordable to the UK health system at a moderately low budget. This study shows the proactive talking intervention to have a very moderate cost and to be effective in providing better health related quality-of-life gains. The intervention is cost savings with a dominant ICER even with a 200% increase in the cost of intervention. The NHS will be providing better oral health for children at a better net monetary benefit-to-risk ratio by adopting the DR-BNI intervention in preventing the reoccurrence of dental fillings and extractions for each participant. This trial was registered prospectively on 27th September 2013 with the trial registration number ISRCTN 24958829.",

Protocols aiming for central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide gap (DCO2) &lt;6 mm Hg have improved organ function in septic shock. Evidence for use of DCO2 in the perioperative period is scarce. We aimed to determine if a GDT protocol using central venous saturation of oxygen (SCvo2) and DCO2 reduced organ dysfunction and intensive care unit (ICU) stay in American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) I and II patients undergoing major surgeries compared to pragmatic goal-directed care. One hundred patients were randomized. Arterial and venous blood-gas values were recorded every 2 hours perioperatively for all patients. Intervention group (GrI) with access to both values was managed per protocol based on DCO2 and SCvo2. Dobutamine infusion 3 to 5 &#xb5;g/kg/min started if DCO2 &gt;6 mm Hg after correcting all macrocirculatory end points. Control group (GrC) had access only to arterial-gas values and managed per \"conventional\" goals without DCO2 or SCvo2. Patients were followed for 48 hours after surgery. Organ dysfunction, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores-primary outcome, length of stay in ICU, and duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation and hospital stay were recorded. The patient, surgeons, ICU team, and analyzer were blinded to group allocation. The groups (44 each) did not significantly differ with respect to baseline characteristics. Perioperative fluids, blood products, and vasopressors used did not significantly differ. The GrI had less organ dysfunction although not significant (79% vs 66%; P = .2). Length of ICU stay in the GrI was significantly less (1.52; standard deviation [SD], 0.82 vs 2.18; SD, 1.08 days; P = .002). Mechanical ventilation duration (0.9 days in intervention versus 0.6 days in control; P = .06) and length of hospital stay did not significantly differ between the groups. Perioperative DCO2 (5.8 vs 8.4 mm Hg; P &lt; .001) and SCvo2 (73.5 vs 68.4 mm Hg; P &lt; .001) were significantly better in the GrI. GDT guided by DCO2 did not improve organ function in our cohort. It resulted in greater use of dobutamine, improved tissue oxygen parameters, and decreased length of ICU stay. More evidence is needed for the routine use of DCO2 in sicker patients. In the absence of cardiac output monitors, it may be a readily available, less-expensive, and underutilized parameter for major surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "Creating sustainable employment-that is, a condition in which employees remain productive but also enjoy good health and well-being-is a challenge for many organizations. Work environment factors are major contributors to these employee outcomes. The job demands-resources model categorizes work environment factors into demands versus resources, which are, respectively, detrimental versus beneficial to employee outcomes. Although conceptualized as <i>workplace</i> factors, these job characteristics have been studied mostly at an individual level. Therefore, their roles at the supraindividual level (i.e., any work-unit level above an individual, such as group or organization) for employee productivity, health, and well-being remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence concerning job resources and job demands at the supraindividual level and their relationships to productivity, health, and work-related well-being. The review covers articles published through December 2018. In total, 202 papers met the inclusion criteria. We found stronger support for the beneficial roles of supraindividual job resources than for the detrimental roles of job demands for productivity and work-related well-being. Regarding health, most of the relationships were found to be nonsignificant. To conclude, this review demonstrates that, at the supraindividual level, the motivational path has received more support than the health impairment path. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for further research and practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

Engaging in any ambulatory moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was greater for Adaptive than for Static Goal groups (OR=2.34, 95% CI=2.10, 2.60 vs OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.50, 1.84; p&lt;0.001) and for Immediate than for Static Reinforcement groups (OR=2.16 95% CI=1.94, 2.40 vs OR=1.77, 95% CI=1.59, 1.97; p&lt;0.01). The Immediate Reinforcement group increased by 16.54 moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes/day, whereas the Delayed Reinforcement group increased by 9.91 minutes/day (p&lt;0.001). The combined Adaptive Goals&#xa0;+&#xa0;Immediate Reinforcement group increased by 16.52 moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes/day, significantly more than that of either Delayed Reinforcement group.

    "abstract": "To investigate how work participation outcomes in randomized controlled trials are measured internationally and across disciplines. We identified trials that reported on work participation in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central published between 2014 and 2019. Screening, selection, and data extraction were done by two authors independently. We grouped outcomes into four categories (\"employment status\", \"absence from work\", \"at-work productivity loss,\" and \"employability\") and created subcategories according to how the outcome was measured. From 10,022 database hits we selected 269 trials reporting on 435 work participation outcomes. Authors used inconsistent outcome terminology to describe the measured constructs. Grouped in four main categories we identified 70 outcomes that reported on \"employment status\", 196 on \"absence from work\" and return-to-work, 132 on \"at-work productivity loss,\" and 37 on \"employability\" outcomes. Variability in measurement methods existed across all categories. Employment status and absenteeism measures consisted mostly of clinimetrically unvalidated tools. \"At-work productivity loss\" and \"employability\" were measured by at least 41 different questionnaires. Extensive variability exists among trials in the measurement of outcomes, measurement methods and measurement instruments that focus on work participation. This study is a first step towards the development of a Core Outcome Set for work participation.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether a task-specific physiotherapist-led training approach is more effective than a non-specific parent-led home programme for attaining bicycle-riding goals in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP). Sixty-two ambulant children with CP aged 6 to 15&#x2009;years (33 males, 29 females, mean age 9y 6mo) with bicycle-riding goals participated in this multi-centre, assessor-blind, parallel-group, superiority randomized controlled trial. Children in the task-specific group participated in a physiotherapist-led, group-based, intensive training programme. Children in the parent-led home group were provided with a practice schedule, generic written information, and telephone support. Both programmes involved a 1-week training period. The primary outcome was goal attainment at 1&#x2009;week after training measured using the Goal Attainment Scale. Secondary outcomes included bicycle skills, participation in bicycle riding, functional skills, self-perception, physical activity, and health-related quality of life at 1&#x2009;week and 3&#x2009;months after training. Children in the task-specific training group had greater odds of goal attainment than those in the parent-led home programme at 1&#x2009;week after intervention (odds ratio [OR] 10.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-38.6), with evidence for superiority retained at 3&#x2009;months (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.3-12.5). The task-specific physiotherapist-led training approach was more effective for attaining bicycle-riding goals than a non-specific parent-led home programme in ambulant children with CP.",

    "abstract": "Health promotion efforts commonly communicate goals for healthy behavior, but the best way to design goal setting among high-risk patients has not been well examined. To test the effectiveness of different ways to set and implement goals within a behaviorally designed gamification intervention to increase physical activity. Evaluation of the Novel Use of Gamification With Alternative Goal-setting Experiences was conducted from January 15, 2019, to June 1, 2020. The 24-week randomized clinical trial included a remotely monitored 8-week introductory intervention period, 8-week maintenance intervention period, and 8-week follow-up period. A total of 500 adults from lower-income neighborhoods in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who had either an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) condition or a 10-year ASCVD risk score greater than or equal to 7.5% were enrolled. Participants were paid for enrolling in and completing the trial. All participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline level, and were then randomly assigned to an attention control or 1 of 4 gamification interventions that varied only on how daily step goals were set (self-chosen or assigned) and implemented (immediately or gradually). The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the 8-week maintenance intervention period. Other outcomes included changes in minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. All randomly assigned participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 500 participants, 331 individuals (66.2%) were Black, 114 were White (22.8%), and 348 were women (69.6%). Mean (SD) age was 58.5 (10.8) years and body mass index was 33.2 (7.8). A total of 215 participants (43.0%) had an ASCVD condition. Compared with the control arm, participants with self-chosen and immediate goals had significant increases in the number of daily steps during the maintenance intervention period (1384; 95% CI, 805-1963; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) that were sustained during the 8-week follow-up (1391; 95% CI, 785-1998; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). This group also had significant increases in daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity during the maintenance intervention (4.1; 95% CI, 1.8-6.4; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) that were sustained during follow-up (3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004). No other gamification arms had consistent increases in physical activity compared with the control arm. No major adverse events were reported. In this trial among economically disadvantaged adults at elevated risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, a gamification intervention led to increases in physical activity that were sustained during 8 weeks of follow-up when goals were self-chosen and implemented immediately.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest challenge facing humanity after the 1918 Flu pandemic. The pandemic also poses a massive challenge to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Meeting this challenge requires a comprehensive investigation of the impact of the pandemic on sustainability. In this work, publications related to the impact of COVID-19 on sustainability in the Web of Science database were explored systematically by using bibliometrics techniques and meta-analysis approach. The results show the research scope is extensive, covering many subjects, whereas the research depth is not enough. Research in developed countries is dominant, although the pandemic poses more significant challenges to the sustainable development of developing countries than of developed countries. Developed countries are committed to studying education sustainability, while developing countries have shown greater attention to economic sustainability during the epidemic. The cluster analysis also shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought negative effects on 17 SDGs goals, whereas the pandemic may also bring opportunities to another 14 SDGs goals. At the end of the article, we put forward relevant suggestions for achieving sustainable development goals in the post-epidemic era.",

Dietary intake is an important consideration to support optimal health and performance. The aims of this systematic review were to: (1) describe the reported free-living dietary intake (energy and macronutrients) of tactical personnel, and (2) describe the practical implications of reported dietary intakes to support the physical and dietary requirements of tactical personnel. A systematic search of databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science) was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. English and full text research articles were identified and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic and dietary intake data were extracted, tabulated, and synthesized narratively. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist. Twenty-two studies (15 military, 4 law enforcement, and 2 fire and rescue) were eligible to inform this review. The volume of evidence suggested that tactical personnel met dietary protein and exceeded dietary fat recommendations but failed to meet energy and carbohydrate recommendations. Therefore, practical approaches to support optimized energy, fat and carbohydrate intake in tactical personnel is important.",

    "abstract": "The proportion of untreated patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) exceeds that of any other mental health disorder, and treatment alternatives are needed. A widely discussed strategy is to depart from the abstinence paradigm as part of controlled drinking approaches. This first systematic review with meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of non-abstinent treatment strategies compared with abstinence-based strategies. CENTRAL, PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase databases were searched until February 2019 for controlled (randomized and non-randomized) clinical trials (RCTs and non-RCTs) among adult AUD populations, including an intervention group aiming at controlled drinking and a control group aiming for abstinence. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, literature search, data collection and risk of bias assessment were carried out independently by two reviewers [International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration no. CRD42019128716]. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants consuming alcohol at or below the recommended threshold. Secondary outcomes were social functioning, drinking reductions, abstinence rates and dropouts. Using random-effects models, RCTs and non-RCTs were analyzed separately. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses accounted for methodological rigor, inclusion of goal-specific treatment, length of follow-up and AUD severity. Twenty-two studies (including five RCTs) with 4204 patients were selected. There was no statistically significant difference between both treatment paradigms in RCTs [odds ratio (OR)&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI)&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.51-3.39]. Non-randomized studies of free goal choice favored abstinence-orientation (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.60, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.40-0.90), unless goal-specific treatment was provided (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.40-1.56), or in studies of low risk of bias (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.73, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.49-1.09) or with long follow-up (OR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.49, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.78-2.85). Effect sizes were not clearly dependent upon AUD severity. Abstinence- and controlled drinking interventions did not clearly differ in their effect on social functioning and drinking reductions. Available evidence does not support abstinence as the only approach in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Controlled drinking, particularly if supported by specific psychotherapy, appears to be a viable option where an abstinence-oriented approach is not applicable.",

    "abstract": "The clinical efficacy of antiobesity medications (AOMs) as adjuncts to lifestyle intervention is well characterized, but data regarding their use in conjunction with workplace wellness plans are lacking, and coverage of AOMs by US private employers is limited. To determine the effect of combining AOMs with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, employer-based weight management program (WMP) compared with the WMP alone on weight loss, treatment adherence, and work productivity and limitations. This 1-year, single-center, open-label, parallel-group, real-world, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, from January 7, 2019, to May 22, 2020. Participants were adults with obesity (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] &#x2265;30) enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan. In total, 200 participants were randomized 1:1, 100 participants to WMP combined with an AOM (WMP+Rx), and 100 participants to WMP alone. The WMP was the Cleveland Clinic Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute's employer-based integrated medical WMP implemented through monthly multidisciplinary shared medical appointments. Participants in the WMP+Rx group initiated treatment with 1 of 5 US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for chronic weight management (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide, 3.0 mg) according to standard clinical practice. The primary end point was the percentage change in body weight from baseline to month 12. The 200 participants were predominately (177 of 200 [88.5%]) women, had a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (10.3) years, and a mean (SD) baseline weight of 105.0 (19.0) kg. For the primary intention-to-treat estimand, the estimated mean (SE) weight loss was -7.7% (0.7%) for the WMP+Rx group vs -4.2% (0.7%) for the WMP group, with an estimated treatment difference of -3.5% (95% CI, -5.5% to -1.5%) (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). The estimated percentage of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss was 62.5% for WMP+Rx vs 44.8% for WMP (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02). The rate of attendance at shared medical appointments was higher for the WMP+Rx group than for the WMP group. No meaningful differences in patient-reported work productivity or limitation measures were observed. Clinically meaningful superior mean weight loss was achieved when access to AOMs was provided in the real-world setting of an employer-based WMP, compared with the WMP alone. Such results may inform employer decisions regarding AOM coverage and guide best practices for comprehensive, interdisciplinary employer-based WMPs. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03799198.",

Presenteeism, the practice of working at reduced potential, is more harmful than absenteeism. Present workers most often experience musculoskeletal pain that is not mitigated by general exercise or stretching. We aimed to assess whether a regimen of pain neuroscience education (PNE) and exercise tailored to individual healthcare workers could reduce presenteeism and improve productivity. An independent investigator randomized 104&#xa0;medical professionals into two&#xa0;groups (intervention and control). The control group received general feedback after answering a questionnaire, while the intervention group received a 6-month plan of exercises and PNE created by a physical therapist with 10&#xa0;years of experience. Our primary outcome was the scores of the Japanese version of the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ) to investigate presenteeism; and our secondary outcomes were pain intensity, widespread pain index (WPI), and EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ5D-5L). In the intervention group, post intervention, we observed significant improvement in presenteeism, pain intensity, WPI, physical and psychological stress, and EQ5D-5L (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.05).

Patients were surveyed after the first restaging visit regarding the quality of the GoC discussion on a scale of 0-10 (0 = worst; 10 = best), with &#x2265; 8 indicating a high-quality GoC discussion. Visits were audiotaped, and total encounter time was measured. The median face-to-face time oncologists spent during a GoC discussion was 15 minutes (range, 10-20 minutes). Among the different hospital types, there was no significant difference in encounter time. There was no difference in the length of the encounter whether a high-quality GoC discussion took place or not (15 <i>v</i> 14 minutes; <i>P</i> = .9). If there was imaging evidence of cancer progression, the median encounter time was 18 minutes compared with 13 minutes for no progression (<i>P</i> = .03). In a multivariate model, oncologist productivity, patient age, and Medicare coverage affected duration of the encounter. Oncologists can complete high-quality GoC discussions in 15 minutes. These data refute the common misperception that discussing such matters with patients with advanced cancer requires significant time.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effect of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics on subjective and objective sleep metrics. Online databases were searched from 1980 to October 2019 for studies involving adults who consumed probiotics or paraprobiotics in controlled trials, during which, changes in subjective and/or objective sleep parameters were examined. A total of 14 studies (20 trials) were included in meta-analysis. Random effects meta-analyses indicated that probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation significantly reduced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (i.e., improved sleep quality) relative to baseline (-0.78-points, 95% confidence interval: 0.395-1.166; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). No significant effect was found for changes on other subjective sleep scales, nor objective parameters of sleep (efficiency/latency) measured using polysomnography or actigraphy. Subgroup analysis for PSQI data suggested that the magnitude of the effect was greater (although not statistically) in healthy participants than those with a medical condition, when treatment contained a single (rather than multiple) strain of probiotic bacteria, and when the duration of treatment was &#x2265;8 weeks. Probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation may have some efficacy in improving perceived sleep health, measured using the PSQI. While current evidence does not support a benefit of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics when measured by other subjective sleep scales, nor objective measures of sleep; more studies using well-controlled, within-subject experimental designs are needed.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a meta-analysis and a scientific mapping about the relationship between different types of well-being and job performance. We followed The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Moher et al., 2009), and conduct the search in Web of Science, SCOPUS, Ebscohost, Proquest, and Jstor databases. We identified 43 studies from 1994 to early 2020 that represent 45 independent samples, 34,221 participants, and 77 correlations between four types of well-being and six of job performance. Meta-analysis results show that are different forms of relations between types and there is not only one form to explain the happy-productive worker hypothesis. The scientific mapping shows that there are seven clusters of topics about well-being and job performance in the Web of Science base articles: (I) Burnout and axiety, (II) Stress and depression, (III) Individual resources, (IV) Work context, (V) Work engagement and commitment, (VI) Justice, and (VII) Human resources practices. We organize the topics from each cluster in the different groups of variables of the contextual model of individual work, well-being and performance (van Veldhoven &amp; Peccei, 2015) to explain their impact in well-being and job performance. We included the observations of our analysis and identified the future key directions for the field.",

    "abstract": "Current industrial production systems allow assembly of customised products which include additional elements distinguishing them from a reference model. This customisation can result in significant additional time constraints which compel workers to complete their tasks faster, which may pose problems for older workers. The objective of this laboratory study was to investigate the impact of restrictive or flexible pacing during assembly of customised products among groups of younger and older participants. The data gathered were used to analyse cycle-time, assembly performance, muscular load, and kinematic adaptations. The flexible pacing condition was found to improve production performance, increasing customised assembly cycle-time and reducing biomechanical load, for both young and older participants. However, as the task required fine manual dexterity, older participants were subjected to a higher biomechanical load, even in the flexible pacing scenario. These results should encourage assembly-line designers to allow flexible time constraints as much as possible and to be particularly attentive to the needs of older workers.",

The goal of this study was to to determine if high-intensity exercise rehabilitation combining resistance training and body-weight interval training, compared with a sleep hygiene control improved objective sleep outcomes in PD. Persons with PD (Hoehn &amp; Yahr stages 2-3; aged &#x2265;45&#x2009;years, not in a regular exercise program) were randomized to exercise (supervised 3 times a week for 16&#x2009;weeks; n = 27) or a sleep hygiene, no-exercise control (in-person discussion and monthly phone calls; n = 28). Participants underwent polysomnography at baseline and post-intervention. Change in sleep efficiency was the primary outcome, measured from baseline to post-intervention. Intervention effects were evaluated with general linear models with measurement of group &#xd7; time interaction.

    "abstract": "There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of rehabilitation in meeting the longer-term needs of stroke patients and their carers. To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an extended stroke rehabilitation service (EXTRAS). A pragmatic, observer-blind, parallel-group, multicentre randomised controlled trial with embedded health economic and process evaluations. Participants were randomised (1&#x2009;:&#x2009;1) to receive EXTRAS or usual care. Nineteen NHS study centres. Patients with a new stroke who received early supported discharge and their informal carers. Five EXTRAS reviews provided by an early supported discharge team member between 1 and 18 months post early supported discharge, usually over the telephone. Reviewers assessed rehabilitation needs, with goal-setting and action-planning. Control treatment was usual care post early supported discharge. The primary outcome was performance in extended activities of daily living (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale) at 24 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes at 12 and 24 months included patient mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), health status (Oxford Handicap Scale), experience of services and adverse events. For carers, secondary outcomes included carers' strain (Caregiver Strain Index) and experience of services. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using resource utilisation costs (adaptation of the Client Service Receipt Inventory) and quality-adjusted life-years. A total of 573 patients (EXTRAS, <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;285; usual care, <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;288) with 194 carers (EXTRAS, <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;103; usual care, <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;91) were randomised. Mean 24-month Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale scores were 40.0 (standard deviation 18.1) for EXTRAS (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;219) and 37.2 (standard deviation 18.5) for usual care (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;231), giving an adjusted mean difference of 1.8 (95% confidence interval -0.7 to 4.2). The mean intervention group Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores were not significantly different at 12 and 24 months. The intervention did not improve patient health status or carer strain. EXTRAS patients and carers reported greater satisfaction with some aspects of care. The mean cost of resource utilisation was lower in the intervention group: -&#xa3;311 (95% confidence interval -&#xa3;3292 to &#xa3;2787), with a 68% chance of EXTRAS being cost-saving. EXTRAS was associated with 0.07 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.12) additional quality-adjusted life-years. At current conventional thresholds of willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year, there is a 90% chance that EXTRAS is cost-effective. EXTRAS did not improve stroke survivors' performance in extended activities of daily living but did improve their overall satisfaction with services. Given the impact on costs and quality-adjusted life-years, there is a high chance that EXTRAS could be considered cost-effective. Further research is required to identify whether or not community-based interventions can improve performance of extended activities of daily living, and to understand the improvements in health-related quality of life and costs seen by provision of intermittent longer-term specialist review. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN45203373. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 24, No. 24. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. Early supported discharge enables stroke patients with mild or moderate disability to be discharged earlier than usual from hospital to continue rehabilitation at home. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that early supported discharge leads to increased independence for stroke survivors, and that early supported discharge is cost-effective. Early supported discharge is usually provided for up to 6 weeks and patients with ongoing physical, psychological or social needs are then referred to other services. In the UK, provision of longer-term rehabilitation is often limited. Lack of research evidence has meant that service development in this aspect of stroke care has lagged behind service development for acute care. This clinical trial evaluated an extended stroke rehabilitation service (EXTRAS) that started when early supported discharge ended. Stroke survivors and their carers were randomly assigned to receive EXTRAS or usual NHS care. EXTRAS involved five rehabilitation reviews conducted over 18 months by an early supported discharge team member, usually over the telephone. Each review consisted of an assessment of current needs, goal-setting and action-planning, and sought to improve patients&#x2019; abilities and confidence to undertake extended activities of daily living (mobility, kitchen and domestic tasks, and leisure activities). There were no specific assessments or actions for carers but it was important to evaluate the impact that the new service had on carers. Patients and carers were followed up for 2 years and information was collected about their activities, mood, quality of life and services received. EXTRAS did not improve stroke survivors&#x2019; performance in extended activities of daily living. However, patients who received EXTRAS reported less anxiety and less depression than those who received usual care, and patients and carers were more satisfied with some aspects of their care. EXTRAS did not improve carers&#x2019; quality of life or stress. Health economic analyses suggest that EXTRAS improved patients&#x2019; quality of life and may be good value for money. Further research is needed to identify other treatments to address the longer-term consequences of stroke.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is a chronic, disabling neurological disease characterized by moderate-to-severe headache pain with other symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. Triptans, while generally effective, are insufficiently efficacious in 30-40% of patients and poorly tolerated by or contraindicated in others. We assessed the impact of insufficient response to triptans on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and work productivity in patients currently receiving any prescribed triptan formulation as their only acute migraine medication. Data were from the 2017 Adelphi Migraine Disease Specific Programme, a cross-sectional survey of primary care physicians, neurologists, and headache specialists and their consulting patients with migraine in the USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK. Triptan insufficient responders (TIRs) achieved freedom from headache pain within 2&#x2009;h of acute treatment in &#x2264;3/5 migraine attacks; triptan responders (TRs) achieved pain freedom within 2&#x2009;h in &#x2265;4/5 attacks. Multivariable general linear model examined differences between TIRs and TRs in HRQoL and work productivity. Logistic regression identified factors associated with insufficient response to triptans. The study included 1413 triptan-treated patients (TIRs: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;483, 34.2%; TRs: n&#x2009;=&#x2009;930, 65.8%). TIRs were more likely to be female (76% vs. 70% for TIRs vs TRs, respectively; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 40.5&#x2009;years; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), and had more headache days/month (7.0 vs. 4.4; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). TIRs had significantly more disability, with higher Migraine Disability Scores (MIDAS; 13.2 vs. 7.7; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), lower Migraine-specific Quality of Life scores, indicating greater impact (Role Function Restrictive: 62.4 vs. 74.5; Role Function Preventive: 70.0 vs. 82.2; Emotional Function: 67.7 vs. 82.1; all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and lower EQ5D utility scores (0.84 vs. 0.91; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Work productivity and activity were impaired (absenteeism, 8.6% vs. 5.1% for TIRs vs. TRs; presenteeism, 34.3% vs. 21.0%; work impairment, 37.1% vs. 23.3%; overall activity impairment, 39.8% vs. 25.3%; all p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). HRQoL and work productivity were significantly impacted in TIRs versus TRs in this real-world analysis of patients with migraine acutely treated with triptans, highlighting the need for more effective treatments for patients with an insufficient triptan response. Further research is needed to establish causal relationships between insufficient response and these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Goals play an important role in the choices that individuals make. Yet, there is no clear approach of how to incorporate goals in discrete choice experiments. In this paper, we present such an approach and illustrate it in the context of lifestyle programs. Furthermore, we investigate how non-health vs. health goals affect individuals' choices via non-goal attributes. We used an unlabeled discrete choice experiment about lifestyle programs based on two experimental conditions in which either a non-health goal (i.e., looking better) or a health goal (i.e., increasing life expectancy) was presented to respondents as a fixed attribute level for the goal attribute. Respondents were randomly distributed over the experimental conditions. Eventually, we used data from 407 Dutch adults who reported to be overweight (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;212 for the non-health goal, and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;195 for the health goal). Random parameter logit model estimates show that the type of goal significantly (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) moderates the effect that the attribute diet has on lifestyle program choice, but that this is not the case for the attributes exercise per week and expected weight loss. A flexible diet is more important for individuals with a non-health goal than for individuals with a health goal. Therefore, we advise policy makers to use information on goal interactions for developing new policies and communication strategies to target population segments that have different goals. Furthermore, we recommend researchers to consider the impact of goals when designing discrete choice experiments.",

    "abstract": "To study factors that have an impact on the conduct of high-quality goals of care (GoC) discussions and productivity of oncologists among four different practice settings in patients with advanced cancer. Solid-tumor oncologists from community, academic, municipal, and rural hospitals were randomly assigned to receive a coaching model of communication skills to help them facilitate a GoC discussion with newly diagnosed patients with advanced cancer who had a less-than-2-year prognosis. Patients were surveyed after the first restaging visit regarding the quality of the GoC discussion on a scale of 0 to 10 (0, worst; 10, best) with a score of 8 or better indicating a high-quality GoC discussion. Productivity was measured by work revenue value units (wRVUs) per hour for the day each oncologist saw the study patient after imaging. The four sites differed significantly in the socioeconomic patient populations they served and in the characteristics of the oncologists who cared for the patients. Overall median productivity across the four sites was 3.6 wRVU/hour, with the highest observed in the community hospital (4.3 wRVU/hour) and the lowest in the rural setting (2.9 wRVU/hour; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in productivity observed when high-quality GOC discussion occurred versus when it did not (3.6 <i>v</i> 3.7 wRVU/hour; <i>P</i> = .86).

A systematic review was performed with close adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched for studies of healthcare organizations applying LH interventions within ambulatory care published between 2002 and 2018. Six databases and grey literature sources were used. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed each study. When consensus was difficult to reach, a third reviewer intervened. Finally, a summary of findings was generated. Out of 5627 studies, 40 were included. Regarding LOS for all patients, 19 out of 22 studies reported a decrease. LOS for discharged patients decreased in 11 out of 13 studies, whereas LOS for admitted patients was reduced in 6 out of 7 studies. Waiting time for patients before seeing a healthcare professional decreased in 24 out of 26 studies. Waiting time to treatment and waiting time for appointments were minimized in 4 and 2 studies, respectively. Patients who left without being seen by a doctor decreased in 9 out of 12 studies. Finally, patient and staff satisfaction were measured in 8 and 2 studies, respectively, with each reporting improvements. According to our findings, LH helped to reduce waiting time and LOS in ambulatory care, mainly owing to its focus on identifying and minimizing non-value added (NVA) activities. Nevertheless, evidence of the impact of LH on patient/staff satisfaction and the translation of the obtained benefits into savings is scarce among studies.",

    "abstract": "Employees dealing with job demands such as high workload and permeable work-life boundaries could benefit from bottom-up well-being strategies such as off-job crafting. We have developed a hybrid off-job crafting intervention to promote off-job crafting, a proactive pursuit to adjust one's off-job time activities to satisfy one's psychological needs. This hybrid intervention contains both on-site (two trainings) and online elements (smartphone app) to enhance employees' well-being and performance within different life domains. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with an intervention group and a waitlist control group. The study population will be Finnish knowledge workers. The intervention program focuses on six psychological needs (detachment, relaxation, autonomy, mastery, meaning, and affiliation) proposed by the DRAMMA model. The intervention will consist of the following components: 1) an on-site off-job crafting training, 2) an individual off-job crafting plan for the four-week intervention period, 3) Everydaily smartphone app usage, and 4) a training session for reflection. The study outcomes are assessed with online questionnaires once at baseline, weekly during the intervention period and twice after the intervention (two-week and six-week follow-up). Moreover, during the second training session, participants will participate in a process evaluation to shed light on the mechanisms that can affect the effectiveness of the intervention. We expect that the intervention will stimulate off-job crafting behaviors, which may in turn increase well-being and performance in both non-work and work domains during and after the intervention (compared to baseline and to the control group). The intervention may provide employees with additional resources to deal with various stressors in life. Furthermore, this off-job crafting intervention could also offer performance benefits for the employers such as increased organizational citizenship behaviors among employees.

    "abstract": "The happy-productive worker thesis (HPWT) assumes that happy employees perform better. Given the relevance of teams and work-units in organizations, our aim is to analyze the state of the art on happy-productive work-units (HPWU) through a systematic review and integrate existing research on different collective well-being constructs and collective performance. Research on HPWU (30 studies, 2001-2018) has developed through different constructs of well-being (hedonic: team satisfaction, group affect; and eudaimonic: team engagement) and diverse operationalizations of performance (self-rated team performance, leader-rated team performance, customers' satisfaction, and objective indicators), thus creating a disintegrated body of knowledge about HPWU. The theoretical frameworks to explain the HPWU relationship are attitude-behavior models, broaden-and-build theory, and the job-demands-resources model. Research models include a variety of antecedents, mediators, and moderating third variables. Most studies are cross-sectional, all propose a causal happy-productive relationship (not the reverse), and generally find positive significant relationships. Scarce but interesting time-lagged evidence supports a causal chain in which collective well-being leads to team performance (organizational citizenship behavior or team creativity), which then leads to objective work-unit performance. To conclude, we identify common issues and challenges across the studies on HPWU, and set out an agenda for future research.",

This systematic review investigated the impact of workplace nutrition and physical activity interventions, which include components aimed at workplace's physical environment and organizational structure, on employees' productivity, work performance and workability. A systematic review that included randomized controlled trials and or non-randomized controlled studies was conducted. Medline, EMBASE.com, Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched until September 2016. Productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism, work performance and workability were the primary outcomes of our interest, while sedentary behavior and changes in other health-related behaviors were considered as secondary outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full-texts for study eligibility, extracted the data and performed a quality assessment using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized trials and the Risk-of-Bias in non-randomized studies of interventions. Findings were narratively synthesized. Thirty-nine randomized control trials and non-randomized controlled studies were included. Nearly 28% of the included studies were of high quality, while 56% were of medium quality. The studies covered a broad range of multi-level and environmental-level interventions. Fourteen workplace nutrition and physical activity intervention studies yielded statistically significant changes on absenteeism (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7), work performance (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), workability (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), productivity (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and on both workability and productivity (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Two studies showed effects on absenteeism only between subgroups. The scientific evidence shows that it is possible to influence work-related outcomes, especially absenteeism, positively through health promotion efforts that include components aimed at the workplace's physical work environment and organizational structure. In order to draw further conclusions regarding work-related outcomes in controlled high-quality studies, long-term follow-up using objective outcomes and/or quality assured questionnaires are required.

    "abstract": "One model of care that has not been tested for chronic low back pain (LBP) is patient-led goal setting. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and healthcare use of a patient-led goal setting approach (intervention) with simple advice to exercise (control) over 12 months. An assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial. Intervention was education combined with patient-led goal setting compared with a control group receiving a standardised exercise programme. The primary outcomes were back pain disability and pain intensity. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and stress. Outcomes and healthcare use were assessed immediately post-treatment (2 months) and after 4 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. Seventy-five patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=37) or the control (n=38) group. Using linear mixed model analyses, adjusted mean changes in primary outcomes of disability and pain intensity were greater in the intervention group than in the control group (disability post-treatment: p&lt;0.05). These differences were clinically meaningful. Mean differences in all secondary measures were greater in the intervention group than in the control group (p&lt;0.05). There was no difference in healthcare use between groups over 12 months. A patient-led goal setting intervention was significantly more effective than advice to exercise for improving outcomes in disability, pain intensity, quality of life, self-efficacy and kinesiophobia in chronic LBP. These improvements were maintained at 12 months. Smaller effects were seen in measures of depression, anxiety and stress. ACTRN12614000830695.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination takes a considerable toll on people's lives, the economy and society at large. Procrastination is often a consequence of people's propensity to prioritize their immediate experiences over the long-term consequences of their actions. This suggests that aligning immediate rewards with long-term values could be a promising way to help people make more future-minded decisions and overcome procrastination. Here we develop an approach to decision support that leverages artificial intelligence and game elements to restructure challenging sequential decision problems in such a way that it becomes easier for people to take the right course of action. A series of four increasingly realistic experiments suggests that this approach can enable people to make better decisions faster, procrastinate less, complete their work on time and waste less time on unimportant tasks. These findings suggest that our method is a promising step towards developing cognitive prostheses that help people achieve their goals.",

    "title": "Assigning Medical Students Learning Goals: Do They Do It, and What Happens When They Don't?",
    "abstract": "<i>Theory:</i> Medical curricula now include more time for trainees to manage their studying independently, yet evidence suggests that time is not well spent without guidance. Social-cognitivist models of self-regulated learning suggest value when guiding learners to set goals related to their performance processes (actions producing outcomes) versus their performance outcomes (products of performance). <i>Hypotheses:</i> We expected participants oriented to set process goals would demonstrate better suturing skill retention compared with participants oriented to set outcome goals. <i>Method:</i> We randomly assigned 41 medical students to two groups: outcome oriented or process oriented. They self-scored their performance using a visual analog scale on every third trial during 25 training trials, and during 10 retention trials 2 weeks later. Two raters assessed participants' suturing performances (process) and final products (outcome). After finding weak support for our hypothesis, we calculated a \"self-monitoring calibration coefficient\" as the Pearson's correlation between the raters' average score and each participant's self-scores. We used a mixed-effects analysis of variance to compare participants' performance scores as well as <i>t</i> tests and an analysis of variance to compare their self-monitoring calibration coefficients. <i>Results:</i> Analysis of skill retention data revealed a significant Group&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;Trial interaction, suggesting a benefit for the process group only for the 10th retention trial (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03). During training, the process group had significantly better (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02) self-monitoring calibration (<i>r</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.71&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;.29) than the outcome group (<i>r</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.38&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;.55). In retention, participants in both groups were significantly better calibrated (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04) with rater's scores of performance processes (<i>r</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.39&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;.60) versus performance outcomes (<i>r</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.11&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;.63). <i>Conclusions:</i> Our findings provide limited evidence for our original hypothesis. Perhaps more important, however, our self-monitoring calibration data highlighted inconsistencies between our interventions and our participants' apparent preferences. Not all participants adopted their assigned goal setting orientation, showing that researchers and educators must consider the extent to which trainees adopt imposed instructions in any educational intervention.",

    "abstract": "We provide a meta-analytic examination of the regulatory strategies that employees adopt to cope with different types of stressors in the workplace and how these strategies are linked to work and personal outcomes. Drawing from regulatory focus theory, we introduce a new taxonomy of promotion- and prevention-focused coping that complements the traditional taxonomy of problem- and emotion-focused coping in the transactional theory of stress. In addition, we propose that challenge stressors tend to evoke promotion-focused coping, whereas hindrance stressors tend to evoke prevention-focused coping. As a pair of important coping mechanisms in the work stress process, promotion-focused coping is positively related to employees' job performance, job attitudes, and personal well-being, whereas prevention-focused coping is negatively related to these outcomes. We conducted an original meta-analysis of coping strategies in the workplace and tested the hypotheses with 550 effect sizes drawn from 156 samples that involved a total of 75,344 employees. We also tested the tenability of the proposed stressor-coping-outcome processes using meta-analytic path models and further examined the robustness of these models using full-information bootstrapping technique. The results converge to show that promotion- and prevention-focused coping serve as important intervening mechanisms that account for the relationships between work stressors and individual outcomes.

    "abstract": "The educational alliance is argued to be at the heart of supervision in medical education. This review aims to map the research field and develop a conceptualisation of the nature of such educational alliances within postgraduate supervision for general practitioners. An integrative review of the international literature on supervision from 2011 to 2018 was undertaken, and papers assessed for relevance and quality. Data analysis incorporated framework analysis techniques. Bordin's working alliance-based model of supervision was used as a springboard for synthesis, as well as allowing for the emergence of new ideas, theories and concepts from the literature. A total of 49 full texts were included for analysis. There was evidence of the importance of trust, agreement and bond in accordance with Bordin's model. The results also highlighted the importance of greater clarity on supervisory goals, and the tasks to support these goals, to effectively address competing priorities and roles within supervision. Non-hierarchical relationships were advocated, although supervisors must remain impartial in their assessment and monitoring roles. The influence of the wider practice community and situated learning through legitimate peripheral participation are documented. A model of General practice (GP) supervision is proposed that integrates the findings. GP supervision requires a greater emphasis than is suggested by the working alliance model, both on the clarity of expectations and the appreciation of the multiple roles and competing priorities of both trainee and supervisor. Furthermore, as GP supervision develops within the rising workload of contemporary general practice, the role of the wider community of practice may become more prominent. We have adapted the working alliance model for postgraduate General practice (GP) supervision, emphasising the explicit sharing of expectations relating to goals, tasks and roles to facilitate negotiation and agreement.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review was to explore the notion of alcohol-related presenteeism; that is, whether evidence in the research literature supports an association between employee alcohol consumption and impaired work performance. Systematic review of observational studies. MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, Embase and Swemed+ were searched through October 2018. Reference lists in included studies were hand searched for potential relevant studies. We included observational studies, published 1990 or later as full-text empirical articles in peer-reviewed journals in English or a Scandinavian language, containing one or more statistical tests regarding a relationship between a measure of alcohol consumption and a measure of work performance. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Tested associations between alcohol consumption and work performance within the included studies were quality assessed and analysed with frequency tables, cross-tabulations and &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> tests of independence. Twenty-six studies were included, containing 132 tested associations. The vast majority of associations (77%) indicated that higher levels of alcohol consumption were associated with higher levels of impaired work performance, and these positive associations were considerably more likely than negative associations to be statistically significant (OR=14.00, <i>phi=</i>0.37, p&lt;0.001). Alcohol exposure measured by hangover episodes and composite instruments were over-represented among significant positive associations of moderate and high quality (15 of 17 associations). Overall, 61% of the associations were characterised by low quality. Evidence does provide some support for the notion of alcohol-related presenteeism. However, due to low research quality and lack of longitudinal designs, evidence should be characterised as somewhat inconclusive. More robust and less heterogeneous research is warranted. This review, however, does provide support for targeting alcohol consumption within the frame of workplace interventions aimed at improving employee health and productivity. CRD42017059620.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is a chief complaint among postmenopausal women, and insomnia impairs daytime functioning and reduces quality of life. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia improves daytime function in this population. This study evaluated whether CBTI improves daytime fatigue, energy, self-reported sleepiness, work productivity, and quality of life in postmenopausal women with insomnia, and whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. Single-site, randomized control trial. One hundred fifty postmenopausal women (56.44 &#xb1; 5.64 years) with perimenopausal or postmenopausal onset or exacerbation of chronic insomnia were randomized to 3 treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. CBTI and SRT produced moderate-to-large improvements in fatigue, energy, sleepiness, and work function at posttreatment and 6 months later. The CBTI group reported better quality of life as indicated by substantial improvements in emotional wellbeing and resiliency to physical and emotional problems, whereas the SRT and SHE groups only showed improvements in resiliency to physical problems. Pain complaints decreased as sleep improved but were not associated with specific treatment conditions. Similarly, insomnia remitters reported fewer daytime and nighttime hot flashes, although reductions were not associated with any specific treatment. CBTI and SRT are efficacious options for postmenopausal women with chronic insomnia. Both interventions improve daytime function, quality of life, and work performance, although CBTI produces superior results including the added benefit of improved emotional health.

This prospective study evaluates whether implementation of scenario/video-created workshops in integrated IPC and TE (IIT) program provides additional benefits for IPC-TE skills of nursing trainees. Mock simulation with two IIT scenarios was held as preintervention IPC-TE assessment. Basic and advanced workshops were arranged for teams of intervention groups for creation of discipline-specific scenario and video. Thirty-six nursing trainees were randomized into teams of five members (three nursing students, one standardized medical student, and one standardized trainees of other profession) in either intervention (scenario plus video and scenario) or control groups. After intervention, all groups received the formal simulation-based assessment using another two IIT scenario. In addition to instructors-based assessment of team' performance in mock and formal IIT simulation using interprofessional team collaboration scale (AITCS), self-assessment of attitudes and program-value score were completed by each trainee, using attitudes toward interprofessional health care teams scale (ATIHCTS) at all stages. Nursing trainees in intervention group gave high satisfaction score to this IIT intervention. In comparison with control group, greater increase in instructor-assessed team performance in the \"partnership,\" \"cooperation,\" and \"shared decision making\" domains of AITCS and the self-assessed \"quality of care delivery\" and TE domains of ATIHCTS were noted in the intervention groups. The overall improvement was greater in the scenario plus video group than those in the scenario group. Further, these improvements among nursing trainees persisted until follow-up stage at 4-weeks later. For nursing trainees, our study suggested that implementation of a scenario creation-based training resulted in additional improvement in trainee' IPC and TE behaviors and attitudes. Additionally, making video of newly created nurse-specific scenario enhances partnership and cooperation among nursing trainees and their interprofessional team members.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, but also has socioeconomic relevance by affecting the health and productivity of workers. We tested the effect of regular telemonitoring-supported physical activity on metabolic syndrome severity and work ability in company employees. This was a prospective, randomised, parallel-group, and assessor-blind study done in workers in the main Volkswagen factory (Wolfsburg, Germany). Volunteers with diagnosed metabolic syndrome according to American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to a 6-month lifestyle intervention focusing on regular exercise (exercise group), or to a waiting-list control group, using a computer-based assignment list with variable block length. Participants in the exercise group received individual recommendations for exercise at face-to-face meetings and via a smartphone application, with the aim of doing 150 min physical activity per week. Activities were supervised and adapted using activity-monitor data, which were transferred to a central database. Participants in the control group continued their current lifestyle and were informed about the possibility to receive the supervised intervention after study completion. The primary outcome was the change in metabolic syndrome severity (metabolic syndrome Z score) after 6 months in the intention-to treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03293264, and is closed to new participants. 543 individuals were screened between Oct 10, 2017, and Feb 27, 2018, of whom 314 (mean age 48 years [SD 8]) were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n=160; exercise group) or to a waiting list (n=154; control group). The mean metabolic syndrome Z score for the exercise group was significantly reduced after the 6-month intervention period (0&#xb7;93 [SD 0&#xb7;63] before and 0&#xb7;63 [0&#xb7;64] after the intervention) compared with the control group (0&#xb7;95 [0&#xb7;55] and 0&#xb7;90 [0&#xb7;61]; difference between groups -0&#xb7;26 [95% CI -0&#xb7;35 to -0&#xb7;16], p&lt;0&#xb7;0001). We documented 11 adverse events in the exercise group, with only one event (a twisted ankle) regarded as directly caused by the intervention. A 6-month exercise-focused intervention using telemonitoring systems reduced metabolic syndrome severity. This form of intervention shows significant potential to reduce disease risk, while also improving mental health, work ability, and productivity-related outcomes for employees at high risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease.

    "abstract": "Clinical medication reviews (CMRs) are increasingly performed in older persons with multimorbidity and polypharmacy to reduce drug-related problems (DRPs). However, there is limited evidence that a CMR can improve clinical outcomes. Little attention has been paid to patients' preferences and needs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a patient-centred CMR, focused on personal goals, on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and on number of health problems. This study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) performed in 35 community pharmacies and cooperating general practices in the Netherlands. Community-dwelling older persons (&#x2265;70 years) with polypharmacy (&#x2265;7 long-term medications) were randomly assigned to usual care or to receive a CMR. Randomisation was performed at the patient level per pharmacy using block randomisation. The primary outcomes were HR-QoL (assessed with EuroQol [EQ]-5D-5L and EQ-Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) and number of health problems (such as pain or dizziness), after 3 and 6 months. Health problems were measured with a self-developed written questionnaire as the total number of health problems and number of health problems with a moderate to severe impact on daily life. Between April 2016 and February 2017, we recruited 629 participants (54% females, median age 79 years) and randomly assigned them to receive the intervention (n = 315) or usual care (n = 314). Over 6 months, in the intervention group, HR-QoL measured with EQ-VAS increased by 3.4 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 5.8; p = 0.006), and the number of health problems with impact on daily life decreased by 12% (difference at 6 months -0.34; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.044; p = 0.024) as compared with the control group. There was no significant difference between the intervention group and control group for HR-QoL measured with EQ-5D-5L (difference at 6 months = -0.0022; 95% CI -0.024 to 0.020; p = 0.85) or total number of health problems (difference at 6 months = -0.30; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.054; p = 0.099). The main study limitations include the risk of bias due to the lack of blinding and difficulties in demonstrating which part of this complex intervention (for example, goal setting, extra attention to patients, reducing health problems, drug changes) contributed to the effects that we observed. In this study, we observed that a CMR focused on personal goals improved older patients' lives and wellbeing by increasing quality of life measured with EQ-VAS and decreasing the number of health problems with impact on daily life, although it did not significantly affect quality of life measured with the EQ-5D. Including the patient's personal goals and preferences in a medication review may help to establish these effects on outcomes that are relevant to older patients' lives.

We evaluated the effectiveness of Health TAPESTRY in attaining goals of older adults (e.g., physical activity, productivity, social connection, medical status) and other outcomes. We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial between January and October 2015 in a primary care practice in Hamilton, Ontario. Older adults were randomized (1:1) to Health TAPESTRY (<i>n</i> = 158) or control (<i>n</i> = 154). Trained community volunteers gathered information on people's goals, needs and risks in their homes, using electronic forms. Interprofessional primary care teams reviewed summaries and addressed issues. Participants reported goal attainment (primary outcome), self-efficacy, quality of life, optimal aging, social support, empowerment, physical activity, falls, and access to and comprehensiveness of the health system. We determined use of health care resources through chart audit. There were no differences between groups in goal attainment or many other patient-reported outcome and experience assessments at 6 months.

The odds of having 1 or more hospital admission were lower for the intervention group (odds ratio [OR] 0.44 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.95]). Health TAPESTRY did not improve the primary outcome of goal attainment but showed signals of shifting care from reactive to active preventive care.

At 3&#xa0;months, there were statistically significant large positive effects for participant-rated goal attainment (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.97; 95% CI, 0.75-1.19), corroborated by informant ratings (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.11; 95% CI, 0.89-1.34). These effects were maintained at 9&#xa0;months for both participant (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.94; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17) and informant (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.2) ratings. The observed gains related to goals directly targeted in the therapy. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. CR enables people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy.",

    "abstract": "Self-regulated learning is optimized when instructional supports are provided. We evaluated three supports for self-regulated simulation-based training: practice schedules, normative comparisons, and learning goals. Participants practiced 5 endoscopy tasks on a physical simulator, then completed 4 repetitions on a virtual reality simulator. Study A compared two practice schedules: sequential (master each task in assigned order) versus unstructured (trainee-defined). Study B compared normative comparisons framed as success (10% of trainees were successful) versus failure (90% of trainees were unsuccessful). Study C compared a time-only goal (go 1&#xa0;min faster) versus time&#x2009;+&#x2009;quality goal (go 1&#xa0;min faster with better visualization and scope manipulation). Participants (18 surgery interns, 17 research fellows, 5 medical/college students) were randomly assigned to groups. In Study A, the sequential group had higher task completion (10/19 vs. 1/21; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), longer persistence attempting an ultimately incomplete task (20.0 vs. 15.9&#xa0;min; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.03), and higher efficiency (43% vs. 27%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02), but task time was similar between groups (20.0 vs. 22.6&#xa0;min; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.23). In Study B, the success orientation group had higher task completion (10/16 vs. 1/24; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and longer persistence (21.2 vs. 14.6&#xa0;min; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001), but efficiency was similar (33% vs. 35%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.84).

    "abstract": "We estimated the potential global economic productivity loss resulting from vision impairment (VI) and blindness as a result of uncorrected myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in&#xa0;2015. Understanding the economic burden of VI associated with myopia is critical to addressing myopia as an increasingly prevalent public health problem. We estimated the number of people with myopia and MMD corresponding to critical visual acuity thresholds. Spectacle correction coverage was analyzed against country-level variables from the year of data collection; variation in spectacle correction was described best by a model based on a human development index, with adjustments for urbanization and age. Spectacle correction and myopia data were combined to estimate the number of people with each level of VI resulting from uncorrected myopia. We then applied disability weights, labor force participation rates, employment rates, and gross domestic product per capita to estimate the potential productivity lost among individuals with each level and type of VI resulting from myopia in 2015 in United States dollars (US$). An estimate of care-associated productivity loss also was included. People with myopia are less likely to have adequate optical correction if they are older and live in a rural area of a less developed country. The global potential productivity loss associated with the burden of VI in 2015 was estimated at US$244 billion (95% confidence interval [CI], US$49 billion-US$697 billion) from uncorrected myopia and US$6 billion (95% CI, US$2 billion-US$17 billion) from MMD. Our estimates suggest that the Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Asia Global Burden of Disease regions bear the greatest potential burden as a proportion of their economic activity, whereas East Asia bears the greatest potential burden in absolute terms. Even under conservative assumptions, the potential productivity loss associated with VI and blindness resulting from uncorrected myopia is substantially greater than the cost of correcting myopia.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analytic review responds to promises in the research literature and public domain about the benefits of workplace mindfulness training. It synthesizes randomized controlled trial evidence from workplace-delivered training for changes in mindfulness, stress, mental health, well-being, and work performance outcomes. Going beyond extant reviews, this article explores the influence of variability in workforce and intervention characteristics for reducing perceived stress. Meta-effect estimates (Hedge's g) were computed using data from 23 studies. Results indicate beneficial effects following training for mindfulness (g = 0.45, p &lt; .001) and stress (g = 0.56, p &lt; .001), anxiety (g = 0.62, p &lt; .001) and psychological distress (g = 0.69, p &lt; .001), and for well-being (g = 0.46, p = .002) and sleep (g = 0.26, p = .003). No conclusions could be drawn from pooled data for burnout due to ambivalence in results, for depression due to publication bias, or for work performance due to insufficient data. The potential for integrating the construct of mindfulness within job demands-resources, coping, and prevention theories of work stress is considered in relation to the results. Limitations to study designs and reporting are addressed, and recommendations to advance research in this field are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "This review examined the impact of environmental, behavioral, and combined interventions to reduce occupational sedentary behaviour on work performance and productivity outcomes. Productivity outcomes were defined as variables assessing work-related tasks (e.g., typing, mouse), whereas performance outcomes were categorized as any variables assessing cognition that did not mimic work-related tasks. Nine databases were searched for articles published up to January 2018. Sixty-three studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria: 45 examined a productivity outcome (i.e., typing, mouse, work-related tasks, and absenteeism), 38 examined a performance outcome (i.e., memory, reading comprehension, mathematics, executive function, creativity, psychomotor function, and psychobiological factors), and 30 examined a self-reported productivity/performance outcome (i.e., presenteeism or other self-reported outcome). Overall, standing interventions do not appear to impact productivity/performance outcomes, whereas walking and cycling interventions demonstrate mixed null/negative associations for productivity outcomes. Hence, standing interventions to reduce occupational sedentary behaviour could be implemented without negatively impacting productivity/performance outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Organizations are turning toward behavioral interventions with the aim of improving employee well-being and job performance. Mindfulness training has been suggested as one type of intervention that can achieve these goals, but few active treatment randomized controlled trials have been conducted. We conducted a randomized controlled trial among employees of a midwestern marketing firm (n = 60) that compared the effects of 6-week mindfulness training program with that of a half-day mindfulness training seminar comparison program on employee well-being outcomes. Although both groups improved comparably on job productivity, the 6-week mindfulness training group had significantly greater improvement in attentional focus at work and decreases in work-life conflict, as well as a marginal improvement in job satisfaction compared with the half-day seminar comparison group. These findings suggest that although small doses of mindfulness training may be sufficient to foster increased perceptions of job productivity, longer term mindfulness training programs are needed to improve focus, job satisfaction, and a positive relationship to work.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a theoretically led workbook intervention designed to support patients with cancer returning to work. Parallel-group randomised controlled trial with embedded qualitative interviews. Oncology clinics within four English National Health Service Trusts. Patients who had received a diagnosis of breast, gynaecological, prostate or colorectal cancer and who had been receiving treatment for a minimum of two weeks. A self-guided WorkPlan workbook designed to support patients with cancer to return to work with fortnightly telephone support calls to discuss progress. The control group received treatment as usual and was offered the workbook at the end of their 12-month follow-up. We assessed aspects of feasibility including eligibility, recruitment, data collection, attrition, feasibility of the methodology, acceptability of the intervention and potential to calculate cost-effectiveness. The recruitment rate of eligible patients was 44%; 68 participants consented and 58 (85%) completed baseline measures. Randomisation procedures were acceptable, data collection methods (including cost-effectiveness data) were feasible and the intervention was acceptable to participants. Retention rates at 6-month and 12-month follow-up were 72% and 69%, respectively. At 6-month follow-up, 30% of the usual care group had returned to full-time or part-time work (including phased return to work) compared with 43% of the intervention group. At 12&#x2009;months, the percentages were 47% (usual care) and 68% (intervention). The findings confirm the feasibility of a definitive trial, although further consideration needs to be given to increasing the participation rates among men and black and ethnic minority patients diagnosed with cancer.

    "abstract": "The SAFE strategy (surgery for trichiasis, antibiotics for active infection, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement) is the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended guideline for the elimination of blindness by trachoma by the year 2020. While evaluations on the implementation of the SAFE strategy have been done, systematic reviews on the factors that have shaped implementation are lacking. This review sought to identify these factors. We searched PUBMED, Google Scholar, CINAHL and Cochrane Collaboration to identify studies that had implemented SAFE interventions. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided development of the data extraction guide and data analysis. One hundred and thirty-seven studies were identified and only 10 papers fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Characteristics of the innovation - such as adaptation of the SAFE interventions to suit the setting and observability of positive health outcomes from pilots - increased local adoption. Characteristics of outer setting - which included strong multisectoral collaboration - were found to enhance implementation through the provision of resources necessary for programme activities. When community needs and resources were unaccounted for there was poor compatibility with local settings. Characteristics of the inner setting - such as poor staffing, high labour turnovers and lack of ongoing training - affected health workers' implementation behaviour. Implementation climate within provider organisations was shaped by availability of resources. Characteristics of individuals - which included low knowledge levels - affected the acceptability of SAFE programmes; however, early adopters could be used as change agents. Finally, the use of engagement strategies tailored towards promoting community participation and stakeholder involvement during the implementation process facilitated adoption process. We found CFIR to be a robust framework capable of identifying different implementation determinants in low resource settings. However, there is a need for more research on the organisational, provider and implementation process related factors for trachoma as most studies focused on the outer setting.",

    "abstract": "Clinical Networks are complex interventions that enable healthcare professionals from various disciplines to work in a coordinated manner in the context of multiple care settings, to provide a high quality response to a specific disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate if clinical networks are able to improve effectiveness, efficiency, patients' satisfaction and professionals' behavior in the health care settings, namely the \"quadruple aim\" quality goals. A systematic review of documents published until February 28, 2018, in Medline, Embase and CINAHL was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach. A specific research strategy was created to identify studies evaluating effectiveness, efficiency, patient satisfaction and professionals well-being obtained through clinical networks implementation. 14249 studies were identified; 12 of these were eligible to the evaluation of \"Quadruple Aim\" outcomes. 9 studies focused on patients' outcomes improvement and 4 on network efficiency. Professionals' and patients' experience were not considered in any study. There are some evidences that clinical network can improve patients' outcomes and health funds allocation in a small number of moderate-low quality studies. Further rigorous studies are needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate patients' and professionals' experience, taking into account also networks' structural features that could influence outcomes achievement.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Using an employer's perspective, this study aimed to compare the immediate and longer-term impact of workplace ergonomics and neck-specific exercise versus ergonomics and health promotion information on health-related productivity among a general population of office workers and those with neck pain. Methods A prospective one-year cluster randomized trial was conducted. Participants received an individualized workstation ergonomics intervention, combined with 12 weeks of either workplace neck-specific exercises or health promotion information. Health-related productivity at baseline, post-intervention and 12-months was measured with the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using multilevel mixed models. Results We recruited 763 office workers from 14 organizations and allocated them to 100 clusters. For the general population of office workers, monetized productivity loss at 12 months [AU$1464 (standard deviation [SD] 1318) versus AU$1563 (SD=1039); P=0.023]; and presenteeism at 12 months [2.0 (SD 1.2) versus 2.4 (SD 1.4); P=0.007] was lower in the exercise group compared to those in the health promotion information group. For office workers with neck pain, exercise participants had lower sickness absenteeism at 12 months compared to health promotion information participants [0.7 days (SD 1.0) versus 1.4 days (SD 3.1); P-=0.012], despite a short-term increase in sickness absenteeism post-intervention compared to baseline for the exercise group [1.2 days (SD 2.2) versus 0.6 days (SD 0.9); P&lt;0.001]. Conclusion A workplace intervention combining ergonomics and neck-specific exercise offers possible benefits for sickness presenteeism and health-related productivity loss among a general population of office workers and sickness absenteeism for office workers with neck pain in the longer-term.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate differences in energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), productivity, fatigue, and pain while performing desk work while sitting (SIT), standing (STAND), and standing on a balance board (BOARD). Thirty healthy adults (60% female, age = 39.7 &#xb1; 11.8 yr, body mass index = 26.7 &#xb1; 5.0 kg&#xb7;m) employed in sedentary-based jobs volunteered for this randomized crossover trial. Participants performed typing work in three different positions: SIT, STAND, and BOARD, each condition lasting 30 min. Oxygen consumption (V&#x2d9;O2) was measured via indirect calorimetry, and EE was calculated using respiratory quotient and corresponding caloric equivalent values. Productivity was quantified by measuring words typed per minute, accuracy, and typing mistakes. Overall feelings of fatigue and pain were self-reported three times during each position using validated 10-cm visual analog scales. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess differences in outcome variables across conditions. V&#x2d9;O2 was significantly different among all conditions regardless of current standing desk use (SIT = 3.35 &#xb1; 0.53, STAND = 3.77 &#xb1; 0.48, BOARD = 3.92 &#xb1; 0.54 mL&#xb7;kg&#xb7;min, P &lt; 0.001).

Compared with sitting (67 &#xb1; 9 bpm), HR was higher in STAND (76 &#xb1; 11 bpm) and BOARD (76 &#xb1; 11 bpm, P &lt; 0.001). Measures of productivity were not different across conditions (P &gt; 0.05). Fatigue progressively increased over each 30-min condition, whereas pain in SIT and BOARD increased from minute 10 to minute 20 and then leveled off between minutes 20 and 30. For STAND, pain continued to increase over time. Compared with sitting, a balance board may be effective for increasing EE without interfering with productivity in an occupational setting.",

    "abstract": "To overcome self-control difficulties, people can commit to their health goals by voluntarily accepting deadlines with consequences. In a commitment lottery, the winners are drawn from all participants, but can only claim their prize if they also attained their gym-attendance goals. In a 52-week, three-arm trial across six company gyms, we tested if commitment lotteries with behavioral economic underpinnings would promote physical activity among overweight adults. In previous work, we presented an effective 26-week intervention. In the present paper we analyzed maintenance of goal attainment at 52-week follow-up and the development of weight over time. We compared weight and goal attainment (gym attendance&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;2 per week) between three arms that-in the intervention period- consisted of (I) weekly short-term lotteries for 13&#xa0;weeks; (II) the same short-term lotteries in combination with an additional long-term lottery after 26&#xa0;weeks; and (III) a control arm without lottery-deadlines. After a successful 26-week intervention, goal attainment declined between weeks 27 and 52 in the long-term lottery arm, but remained higher than in the control group. Goal attainment did not differ between the short-term lottery arm and control arm. Weight declined slightly in all arms in the first 13&#xa0;weeks of the trial and remained stable from there on. Commitment lotteries can support regular gym attendance up to 52&#xa0;weeks, but more research is needed to achieve higher levels of maintenance and weight loss.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this study was to explore the mechanisms and conditions whereby Tension-Type Headache (TTH) presenteeism relates to health-related loss of productivity as a result of both reduced physical and mental health. To this end, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to conduct a secondary data analysis of a randomized clinical trial involving 78 Tension-type Headache (TTH) patients. The results showed that TTH presenteeism did not directly relate to health-related loss of productivity, either due to physical, or mental health problems. However, through anxiety-state, TTH presenteeism decreased patients' productivity, as consequence of reduced physical and mental health. Moreover, by increasing the severity of the Tension-Type Headache, TTH presenteeism indirectly decreased patients' productivity as consequence of reduced physical health (but not mental health). Finally, our results show that such indirect effects only occur when the cause of TTH is non-mechanical (e.g., hormonal causes, etc.). Our work provides an integrative model that can inform organizational behaviorists and health professionals (e.g., physiotherapists). Implications for organizational health are discussed.",

Similarly, SLE patients have an increased rate of work loss and work limitations. The aim of our paper was to systematically assess the relationship between fatigue and work disability in SLE. We performed a systematic review using the terms \"fatigue\" and \"employment\", \"work disability\", \"work impairment\", \"presenteeism\" and \"absenteeism.\" 19 studies were identified. Fatigue was involved in the development of work loss. In employed patients, fatigue led to impairment of work productivity and presenteeism with a parallel increase of both direct and indirect health costs. Fatigue also affected parenting and household productivity. An adequate control of fatigue could improve physical and work performance in SLE patients thus reducing rates of work loss.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is increasingly acknowledged as having a substantial socioeconomic impact associated with impaired work productivity, although available information remains fragmented. This systematic review summarizes recently available information to provide a quantitative estimate of the burden of AR on work productivity including lost work time (ie, absenteeism) and reduced performance while working (ie, presenteeism). A Medline search retrieved original studies from 2005 to 2015 pertaining to the impact of AR on work productivity. A pooled analysis of results was carried out with studies reporting data collected through the validated Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. The search identified 19 observational surveys and 9 interventional studies. Six studies reported economic evaluations. Pooled analysis of WPAI-based studies found an estimated 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4; 4.8%) missed work time and 35.9% (95% CI, 29.7; 42.1%) had impairment in at-work performance due to AR. Economic evaluations indicated that indirect costs associated with lost work productivity are the principal contributor to the total AR costs and result mainly from impaired presenteeism. The severity of AR symptoms was the most consistent disease-related factor associated with a greater impact of AR on work productivity, although ocular symptoms and sleep disturbances may independently affect work productivity. Overall, the pharmacologic treatment of AR showed a beneficial effect on work productivity. This systematic review provides summary estimates of the magnitude of work productivity impairment due to AR and identifies its main determinant factors.

    "abstract": "Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, but most ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients do not obtain enough. ACTIVE REWARD (A Clinical Trial Investigating Effects of a Randomized Evaluation of Wearable Activity Trackers with Financial Rewards) was a 24-week home-based, remotely monitored, randomized trial with a 16-week intervention (8-week ramp-up incentive phase and 8-week maintenance incentive phase) and an 8-week follow-up. Patients used wearable devices to track step counts and establish a baseline. Patients in control received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm received personalized step goals and daily feedback for all 24&#xa0;weeks. In the ramp-up incentive phase, daily step goals increased weekly by 15% from baseline with a maximum of 10&#xa0;000 steps and then remained fixed. Each week, $14 was allocated to a virtual account; $2 could be lost per day for not achieving step goals. The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. Ischemic heart disease patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years and 70% were male. Compared with control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp-up (1388 versus 385; adjusted difference, 1061 [95% confidence interval, 386-1736]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), maintenance (1501 versus 264; adjusted difference, 1368 [95% confidence interval, 571-2164]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and follow-up (1066 versus 92; adjusted difference, 1154 [95% confidence interval, 282-2027]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Loss-framed financial incentives with personalized goal setting significantly increased physical activity among ischemic heart disease patients using wearable devices during the 16-week intervention, and effects were sustained during the 8-week follow-up.

    "title": "Enacting rituals to improve self-control.",
    "abstract": "Rituals are predefined sequences of actions characterized by rigidity and repetition. We propose that enacting ritualized actions can enhance subjective feelings of self-discipline, such that rituals can be harnessed to improve behavioral self-control. We test this hypothesis in 6 experiments. A field experiment showed that engaging in a pre-eating ritual over a 5-day period helped participants reduce calorie intake (Experiment 1). Pairing a ritual with healthy eating behavior increased the likelihood of choosing healthy food in a subsequent decision (Experiment 2), and enacting a ritual before a food choice (i.e., without being integrated into the consumption process) promoted the choice of healthy food over unhealthy food (Experiments 3a and 3b). The positive effect of rituals on self-control held even when a set of ritualized gestures were not explicitly labeled as a ritual, and in other domains of behavioral self-control (i.e., prosocial decision-making; Experiments 4 and 5). Furthermore, Experiments 3a, 3b, 4, and 5 provided evidence for the psychological process underlying the effectiveness of rituals: heightened feelings of self-discipline. Finally, Experiment 5 showed that the absence of a self-control conflict eliminated the effect of rituals on behavior, demonstrating that rituals affect behavioral self-control specifically because they alter responses to self-control conflicts. We conclude by briefly describing the results of a number of additional experiments examining rituals in other self-control domains. Our body of evidence suggests that rituals can have beneficial consequences for self-control. (PsycINFO Database Record",

    "abstract": "Sleep alterations associated with adulthood ADHD are poorly understood. Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of sleep studies in adults with ADHD. Based on a pre-registered protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42017065407), we searched Pubmed, Ovid and Web of Knowledge databases through August 3rd, 2017, with no language or publication type restrictions, and contacted study authors for unpublished data/information. From a pool of 8812 references, we retained 13 studies. Random-effects models were performed and study quality was rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Compared to adults without ADHD, those with ADHD significantly differed in seven out of nine subjective parameters (Standardized Mean Difference, SMD, ranging from 0.56 to 1.55) and two out of five actigraphic parameters [SMD (95% CI): sleep onset latency: 0.80 (0.46-1.14); sleep efficiency: -0.68 (-1.03, -0.34)]. No significant differences were detected for polysomnographic parameters. We conclude that, whereas subjectively reported sleep problems are significantly associated with ADHD in adults and should be systematically screened during the clinical interview, additional research is needed to understand if they are underpinned by objective sleep alterations.",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing need to improve access to evidence-based practice for people with psychosis. The primary aim of this study was to assess clinical feasibility of a manualised, evidence-based CBT intervention (GOALS) targeting a personalised recovery goal, delivered by the frontline workforce, following brief training. Secondly, we aimed to conduct preliminary statistical analyses of key outcomes and costs. The GOALS study is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN 73188383). 75 participants with current psychosis were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual alone or with GOALS therapy. Brief training enabled frontline staff to deliver the therapy according to protocol and 74% of therapy participants partially or fully achieved their goals. There were significant improvements with a moderate effect size of 0.56 on goal attainment. However, preliminary statistical analyses found no significant differences between groups on our primary outcome of activity levels or other secondary outcomes Health economic analysis found that point estimates of costs, controlling for baseline costs, implied savings (even including intervention costs), but the difference was not statistically significant. The study was designed as a feasibility RCT, and therefore the results of secondary estimates of efficacy effects should be treated with caution. This approach holds promise in supporting people with psychosis to reach personal recovery goals, cost effectively.",

A group-randomized multisite controlled experimental study with longitudinal follow-up. An information technology firm. Employees randomized to the intervention (n = 348) and control condition (n = 345). An intervention, \"Start. Transform. Achieve. Results.\" to enhance employees' control over their work time, to increase supervisors' support for this change, and to increase employees' and supervisors' focus on results. We estimated the effect of the intervention on 9 self-reported employee performance measures using a difference-in-differences approach with generalized linear mixed models. Performance measures included actual and expected hours worked, absenteeism, and presenteeism. This study found little evidence that an intervention targeting work-family conflict affected employee performance. The only significant effect of the intervention was an approximately 1-hour reduction in expected work hours. After Bonferroni correction, the intervention effect is marginally insignificant at 6 months and marginally significant at 12 and 18 months. The intervention reduced expected working time by 1 hour per week; effects on most other employee self-reported performance measures were statistically insignificant. When coupled with the other positive wellness and firm outcomes, this intervention may be useful for improving employee perceptions of increased access to personal time or personal wellness without sacrificing performance. The null effects on performance provide countervailing evidence to recent negative press on work-family and flex work initiatives.",

The workshops involved six meetings based on behavioral and cognitive techniques, paradox intervention, and psychoeducation. 175 students participated voluntarily. Their procrastination levels were measured in a pretest, post-test, and a 3-month follow-up. After the first interview, the participants were randomly divided into three groups (Intervention A, Intervention B, and a control group with no intervention). There was a significant improvement after the intervention. After 3 months, the average score was still significantly lower than in the pretest, whereas the score of the control group remained unchanged. The participants in Workshop A scored significantly lower in the post-test than the ones in Workshop B. After 3 months, the participants in Workshop B scored significantly lower in the follow up. So both interventions resulted to be effective in reducing procrastination sustainably.",

    "title": "Extra-virgin olive oil and additional cardiovascular outcomes in the PREDIMED Trial: An outcome-wide perspective.",
    "abstract": "Olive oil, increasingly consumed in the U.S., has been inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, previous studies did not assess a broad spectrum of CVD outcomes, incorporated repeated annual dietary assessments, or distinguished between polyphenol-rich EVOO and common olive oil (COO), which lacks these compounds. We assessed 7102 high-risk participants from the PREDIMED trial (57.5% women; aged 55-80 years), all free of CVD at baseline. Olive oil consumption was assessed annually, and cumulative average intakes of EVOO and COO were calculated. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or cardiovascular death, whichever occurred first. Individual outcomes were also evaluated. Time-dependent Cox models were adjusted for major confounders, including trial intervention arm. Over a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 621 participants experienced at least one CVD event. Participants in the highest tertile of cumulative EVOO intake (mean: 49.2 g/d) had a 25% lower risk of the composite outcome (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60-0.94), with significant reductions in several individual CVD outcomes. In the decile analysis, the highest (mean: 60.9 g/d) versus lowest decile had a 48% lower risk (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.79). COO consumption was not significantly associated with CVD risk when mutually adjusted for EVOO (HR<sub>per 10 g/d</sub>: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-1.00). High consumption of EVOO is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of an outcome-wide composite of CVD events among high-risk individuals. In contrast, COO, which lacks polyphenols, showed weaker associations, highlighting the importance of differentiating olive oil types in CVD prevention strategies. This trial was registered in the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN 35739639): https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN35739639.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) on gut microbiota in individuals with obesity. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across four electronic databases-PubMed, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science-up to June 2025. Outcomes included changes in gut microbial diversity and the relative abundance of key taxa. Subgroup analyses were performed based on body mass index (BMI), age, and intervention duration. A total of 14 studies were included. Random-effects meta-analysis revealed that VLCKD interventions significantly improved gut microbial <i>&#x3b1;</i>-diversity, as indicated by increased Shannon index (<i>SMD</i>: 0.54, <i>95% CI</i>: 0.03 to 1.04, <i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0378) and Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) index (<i>SMD</i>: 0.77, <i>95% CI</i>: 0.36 to 1.18, <i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0002). In addition, VLCKD significantly increased the abundance of Akkermansia (<i>SMD</i>: 1.76, <i>95% CI</i>: 0.48 to 3.03, <i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0069) and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio (<i>SMD</i>: 1.01, <i>95% CI</i>: 0.67 to 1.34, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001), while significantly reducing the probiotic genus Bifidobacterium (<i>SMD</i>: -1.23, <i>95% CI</i>: -1.81 to -0.64, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analyses indicated that the increase in Shannon index was more pronounced in participants with BMI&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;30 kg/m&#xb2; and age &gt;30 years. Akkermansia showed a greater increase in those with BMI 30-35 kg/m&#xb2;, age &gt;40 years, and intervention duration &#x2264;6 weeks. Conversely, Bifidobacterium abundance declined significantly in individuals with BMI 30-35 kg/m&#xb2;, age &gt;40 years, and within an intervention period &#x2264;12 weeks. VLCKD appears to be a promising dietary intervention for modulating gut microbiota in individuals with obesity. However, its bidirectional effects on microbial ecology warrant caution. Future studies should further investigate its long-term safety and explore personalized strategies for microbiota-targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between occupational physical activity (OPA) and depression remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the association between OPA and depression risk, including dose-response relationships. A systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases was conducted and update through May 25th 2025. Observational studies investigating the relationship between OPA and depression risk were included. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled relative risks (RRs), and both linear and nonlinear dose-response analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Eleven studies with 183,555 participants in total were included. The pooled RR that compared highest versus lowest OPA levels was 1.25 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.40), indicating increased depression risk with higher OPA. Linear dose-response analysis showed that each 1-hour increment in OPA was associated with a 5% elevated depression risk (RR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations among males (RR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.93) and in Asian populations (RR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.23). Studies using depression-specific assessment tools (e.g., the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) have shown stronger associations with depression than those using general mental health questionnaires. This meta-analysis provides evidence that higher levels of OPA are associated with increased depression risk, challenging the assumption that all forms of physical activity benefit mental health. These findings highlight the importance of considering the context of physical activity and suggest the need for workplace interventions that address the unique characteristics of OPA.",

    "abstract": "Stress is not only a transdiagnostic risk factor for depressive and anxiety disorders but is also closely associated with disease relapse and treatment compliance in psychiatric care. The lack of access to nature in closed psychiatric wards may exacerbate patients' perceived stress, while virtual reality (VR)-based immersive nature technology offers an innovative solution. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a short-term, low-dose VR nature immersion protocol (10&#xa0;min per day for 3 consecutive days) on hospitalized psychiatric patients in China. This study employed a randomized controlled trial design, enrolling 60 inpatients diagnosed with depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Seven participants withdrew, leaving 27 in the VR nature group and 26 in the VR city control group. Intervention effects were measured using multidimensional indicators, including psychological scales, physiological indicators, and immediate emotion. The VR nature group exhibited significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety, along with significantly increased connectedness to nature. Physiological data indicated that the VR nature group had significantly lower heart rates compared to the control group. After a single VR session, the VR nature group demonstrated a significant improvement in positive emotions and a marked reduction in negative emotions. This research provides evidence that short-term VR nature immersion effectively alleviates stress and emotional in hospitalized psychiatric patients. The consistent results across psychological, physiological, and immediate emotional indicators validate its efficacy. The proposed lightweight protocol is both clinically feasible and safe, offering a new pathway for stress intervention in closed psychiatric wards.",

There were no significant differences between the turmeric formulation and placebo in muscle soreness area under the curve from pre-exercise to 72&#x2009;hours post-exercise and at all timepoints, except for a trend observed in males 72&#x2009;hours after exercise (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;-4.8 [2.7] mm, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0776). Muscle soreness recovery (difference between soreness at 72&#x2009;hours and maximal post-exercise soreness) was significantly greater with the turmeric formulation compared to placebo (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;-10.7% [4.3%], <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0184 for the male participants, and -7.9% [3.6%], <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0346 for the total sample). Furthermore, in males, the decrease from pre-exercise to 24&#x2009;hours after exercise in isokinetic peak torque was significantly lower with the turmeric formulation (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.0 [4.9] Nm, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0275), as was the decrease in isokinetic max rep work (adjusted mean [SE] for difference from placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.6 [4.9] J, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0195), while vertical jump peak power at 24&#x2009;hours after exercise was higher (median [interquartile range] with the turmeric formulation vs. placebo&#x2009;=&#x2009;931.1 [825.9; 1001.1] W vs. 916.5 [824.8; 989.5] W, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0445). Supplementation with the turmeric formulation can accelerate exercise-induced muscle soreness recovery and could attenuate muscular function loss and improve performance after unaccustomed exercise in young, moderately active, male adults.",

    "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increase cardiovascular disease risk. Postpartum interventions can motivate lifestyle changes but are not universally effective. Our objective was to determine how behavioral phenotypes are associated with response to a digital health intervention designed to increase physical activity among 122 postpartum individuals with HDP. We conducted a secondary analysis of the STEP UP Mom trial, comparing a wearable step tracker with team-based gamification to a wearable step tracker alone over 12 weeks. Baseline behavioral characteristics were obtained using validated surveys. We applied the k-means clustering method to identify clusters. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate mean step count difference between arms from baseline across follow-up within each cluster. We identified two distinct, non-overlapping clusters. Cluster 1 had higher baseline steps and greater psychosocial distress, without significant difference in change in step count in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Cluster 2 had lower baseline steps and less psychosocial distress and walked 1,335 significantly more steps per day in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Sustained engagement with the study intervention did not differ between clusters. Behavioral phenotypes may help identify postpartum individuals who may benefit from tailored interventions in future studies to improve lifestyle changes.",

    "abstract": "&#x3b2;-alanine is a well-established ergogenic aid that enhances muscle carnosine levels and buffering capacity during high-intensity efforts. However, its role in improving strength and power performance remains inconsistent across the literature. This systematic review investigates whether dosing strategy, rather than duration alone, is the critical determinant of efficacy in resistance-trained populations. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to 28 May 2025, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included based on the PICO framework, targeting trained individuals receiving &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation with defined dosing protocols and strength- or power-based outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Nine studies comprising 197 participants were reviewed. Daily &#x3b2;-alanine doses between 4&#x2009;g and 6.4&#x2009;g, especially when divided into multiple smaller servings such as 0.8&#x2009;g taken several times a day, were more likely to enhance maximal strength and power-related outcomes. In contrast, studies that used high total doses but relied on sustained-release formats, single large servings, or training protocols with limited metabolic stress such as low volume or long rest intervals often failed to show improvements in performance. These findings suggest that cumulative dose and delivery method may play a more critical role than duration alone in promoting strength and power adaptations. To optimize strength and power outcomes, &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation should emphasize fragmented dosing protocols of 4-6.4&#x2009;g/day sustained over 5-8&#x2009;weeks, particularly when implemented during training phases characterized by high metabolic stress - such as repeated submaximal efforts, short rest intervals, or high-volume hypertrophy sessions that elevate intramuscular acidity. These findings offer refined guidelines for coaches, athletes, and sport nutrition practitioners, and highlight the need for more individualized and mechanistically informed supplementation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Loneliness in older adults is a critical public health issue with dynamic changes over time. Understanding its longitudinal patterns is vital for identifying high-risk individuals and developing timely interventions. This review synthesizes evidence on loneliness trajectories, their predictors, and associated health outcomes in older populations. A systematic search across nine databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang) was conducted from inception to December 1, 2024, updated on August 18, 2025, focusing on longitudinal studies of adults aged &#x2265;60 years. Quality was assessed using JBI tools, and a narrative synthesis was performed due to methodological heterogeneity. Of the 2985 screened records, 16 studies met the predefined inclusion criteria. Fifteen of these studies were rated as moderate or high quality. Despite heterogeneity in analytical approaches, four loneliness trajectory patterns were identified: stable-low, stable-high, ascending, and descending. The stable-high and ascending trajectories were consistently associated with adverse health outcomes, including accelerated cognitive decline and greater severity of depressive symptoms. Key predictors of high-risk loneliness trajectories included social isolation, functional impairment, and exposure to major life stressors. Loneliness among older adults follows heterogeneous trajectories, with the stable-high and ascending patterns indicating the highest risk for adverse health outcomes. These findings underscore the need for early screening of key risk factors and the implementation of trajectory-tailored interventions. Future research should prioritize standardized loneliness measurement tools and integrated analytical approaches to enhance the comparability of findings and their translation into clinical practice.",

However, most previous studies were conducted under fasted conditions, which may not accurately reflect the typical practices of athletes who generally consume food before intense exercise or competition. This study examined the effects of CHO, CAF, and CHO+CAF mouth rinses on physiological and perceptual responses during high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) following a pre-exercise meal. Twelve recreationally active males (age: 23.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.2&#x2009;years) completed four HIIE trials involving 8 bouts of 1-min cycling at 85% of peak power output (PPO), separated by 1-min active recovery at 20% of PPO.

    "abstract": "Recent studies indicate a protective role of vitamin D supplementation against sports performance-induced dysregulation of body homeostasis. However, the effects of a single high dose of vitamin D on changes in bone formation and resorption markers due to ultramarathon running have yet to be explored. This study aimed to analyze the effect of a single high-dose vitamin D supplementation on serum levels of bone turnover markers after a mountain ultramarathon run. In this clinical trial (reg. number NCT03417700), 35 semiprofessional male ultramarathon runners were assigned into two groups: supplemented group, administered a single high dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol, 150,000 IU) in vegetable oil 24&#x2009;h before the start of the run (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), and placebo group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;19), administered placebo solution 24&#x2009;h before the start of the run. Blood samples were collected for analysis at three timepoints: 24&#x2009;h before, immediately after, and 24&#x2009;h after the run. Serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> level significantly increased (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05.) after the ultramarathon in both groups. The increase was more pronounced in the supplemented population, especially 24&#x2009;h after the run (147.01% vs 84.71%). According to post-hoc and other analyses, the levels of N-terminal propeptides of type I collagen, a PINP marker, were increased immediately after the run. The increase was significantly higher in the supplemented group than in the control group. CTX, PTH, sclerostin, and procalcitonin levels were significantly higher 24&#x2009;h after the run in the control group. The observed attenuation of post-exercise bone resorption and enhancement of bone formation suggest that vitamin D supplementation may modulate bone metabolism in response to extreme physical exertion, potentially through effects on calcium - PTH homeostasis.",

However, direct evidence demonstrating its superiority over traditional refueling guidelines has been lacking. This exploratory study compared a CGM-informed protocol with a traditional interval-based (TRAD) carbohydrate refueling protocol on endurance exercise responses. Twelve healthy, non-diabetic males (age&#x2009;=&#x2009;32.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.3&#x2009;years) participated in two trials involving 75&#x2009;minutes of continuous cycling at 50% peak power output, with the two carbohydrate refueling protocols implemented in a randomized, crossover order. In the TRAD protocol, participants received standard carbohydrate solutions at regular 15-min intervals, while replenishment timing in the CGM-informed protocol was guided by real-time glucose trends, particularly during declines. No significant differences were observed in heart rate, blood lactate, or perceived exertion between conditions (all p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). However, CGM-informed protocol displayed a lower coefficient of variation of glucose levels (8.82&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.68%) than the TRAD protocol (11.95&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.41%, Cohen's d &#x2009;=&#x2009;0.76, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013), indicating a steadier blood glucose trend.

    "abstract": "Frailty is defined as a biological syndrome characterized by a decreased reserve and resistance to stressors. Frailty is closely related to lifestyle, and improving lifestyle can effectively reduce the incidence of frailty and related adverse events. Multi-component interventions were an effective mean of improving lifestyle, which has been validated in studies of other populations. This review aimed to explore the effects of multi-component interventions on the lifestyle in pre-frail or frail older adults. Six databases were systematically searched as of 19 November 2024. Only randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. The mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) were calculated to determine the pooled intervention effects. Methodological quality and evidence were assessed using the RoB2 tool and GRADE online tool. Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The results showed that the multi-component interventions had positive effects on physical activity (SMD = 0.65, 95 %CI [0.36, 0.95]), social activity (SMD = 0.21, 95 %CI [0.04, 0.37]) and dietary nutrition (SMD = 0.78, 95 %CI [0.11, 1.44]), may reduce sedentary behavior (MD = -31.12, 95 %CI [-58.38, -3.85]). In summary, this review analyzed existing literature and the results showed that multi-component interventions have significant benefits on the lifestyle in pre-frail or frail older adults. As the current evidence was limited, more researches were needed in the future to further enrich the evidence in the field of multi-component interventions for pre-frail or frail older adults.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the optimal dose range of physical exercise for improving executive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to compare the dose-dependent cognitive response profiles across different exercise modalities. A systematic literature search was conducted across five databases-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science-up to June 20, 2025, with no language restrictions. All analyses were performed in R (version 4.4.2). A Bayesian framework was used to model continuous dose-response curves and to evaluate the relative effects of aerobic training, integrated physical training, and resistance exercise within a network structure. Exercise interventions demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with executive function, with the strongest effect observed at approximately 1000 MET-min/week. Among exercise types, continuous aerobic training showed significant improvement at 670 MET-min/week, indicating a relatively low-dose threshold for benefit. In contrast, integrated physical training programs required higher doses (around 1200 MET-min/week) to reach peak effect, suggesting greater intensity dependence. Resistance training did not yield consistent or statistically significant outcomes across the tested dose levels. This study establishes a quantitative framework that integrates dose modeling with intervention structure to guide exercise-based cognitive strategies for AD. The findings emphasize the need to match exercise volume to modality demands and individual capacity, supporting the development of precision-oriented, non-pharmacological interventions. The identified optimal range (670-1200 MET-min/week) aligns with WHO recommendations for older adults, reinforcing both feasibility and translational potential.",

In this RCT study, 26 male powerlifters (24.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.5&#x2009;y; 92.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;13.6&#x2009;kg) were assigned to a rapid weight loss (RWL; <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) or control group (CON; <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;13). RWL participants followed a 4-day protocol including caloric restriction (-10%), low carbohydrate intake (&#x2009;&lt;50&#x2009;g/day), low sodium, and fluid manipulation, targeting a 5% body mass reduction. The CON group maintained habitual diet and hydration. Maximal strength was assessed via simulated powerlifting competition conducted before (C1) and after (C2) the intervention. Performance variables included squat (SQ), bench press (BP), deadlift (DL), and total load (TOTAL), along with IPF GL (International Powerlifting Federation GoodLift points) and IPF GL BP (International Powerlifting Federation GoodLift for Bench Press) scores. Body composition and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were also evaluated. The RWL group achieved a mean body mass reduction of 4.81%, with significant decreases in fat mass (-15.7%), fat-free mass (-2.36%), and body water (-2.41%) compared to CON (all <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Despite these changes, no significant differences in maximal strength (SQ, BP, DL, TOTAL) were observed between C1 and C2 or between groups. However, the RWL group showed a significant post-intervention increase in IPF GL (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015) and IPF GL BP scores (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017). RPE values showed no consistent or practically relevant changes. In the group that underwent a rapid weight loss of approximately 5%, followed by a short-term recovery period, maximal strength performance was maintained. This indicates that it is possible to reduce body mass without compromising absolute strength levels in competitive powerlifters. At the same time, RWL group achieved higher IPF GL and IPF GL BP values.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the most effective exercise modalities and optimal dose ranges for improving cognitive function in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a systematic search of five databases up to June 1, 2025, and included 33 RCTs involving 1,256 PD patients. Exercise doses were standardized using MET&#xb7;min/week. A Bayesian dose-response network meta-analysis was performed in R to model nonlinear cognitive effects across nine exercise modalities. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework. The pooled analysis revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between exercise dose and cognitive outcomes, with the greatest benefit observed around 890 MET&#xb7;min/week. The optimal range for cognitive improvement was identified between 500 and 1000 MET&#xb7;min/week, beyond which the effects plateaued or declined, particularly above 1200 MET&#xb7;min/week. Among the evaluated modalities, only multicomponent training and mind-body exercise demonstrated consistent and significant cognitive improvements at moderate doses. While virtual reality and aerobic walking showed beneficial effects at specific dose points, their overall efficacy was less stable. No consistent effects were observed for cycling, dance, or resistance training within the primary dose range. This study is the first to construct a comprehensive dose-modality response model for cognitive enhancement in PD, providing empirical evidence for the optimal dose range and preferred exercise strategies. The findings offer a robust basis for developing tailored, precision-based non-pharmacological interventions for individuals with PD, with potential applicability to broader populations affected by neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "title": "How reliable is the labeling of a commercial phytosteroid product? A 12-week randomized double-blind training study.",
    "abstract": "Phytosteroids like 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and diosgenin (DSG) have shown promising anabolic and performance-enhancing effects in in vitro, animal, and human studies. Combining phytosteroids is common in supplements, with early in vitro research suggesting additive effects via distinct signaling pathways. However, human studies on the combined effects of 20E and DSG are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the anabolic and performance-enhancing potential of a commercially available 20E and DSG supplement. Twenty-eight resistance-trained young men were recruited for this study. Participants were randomized into two groups: a 20E and DSG (EcDi) group, and a placebo (Plac) group. Both groups performed free-weight resistance training three times per week for 12&#x2009;weeks. The EcDi group received a commercially available phytosteroid product three times a day (as recommended on the label), while the Plac group received a placebo product. Assessments were conducted at four time points (T0, T1 [4&#x2009;weeks], T2 [8&#x2009;weeks], T3 [12&#x2009;weeks]) and included measurements of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) for the squat (SQ) and bench press (BP) exercises, as well as body weight (BW), fat-free mass (FFM), muscle mass (MM), fat mass (FM), and muscle thickness of the pectoralis major (PM) and the proximal, middle and distal regions of the anterior (i.e. <i>M. rectus femoris</i> and <i>M. vastus intermedius</i>) and lateral quadriceps femoris (i.e. <i>M. vastus lateralis</i> and <i>M. vastus intermedius</i>). Liver and kidney function, along with endocrine parameters, were measured via blood samples pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, the concentration of 20E and DSG in the product was measured by LC-MS/MS, and its biological activity was evaluated using C2C12 cells after the intervention. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM). Twenty-four participants completed the study successfully. Significant improvements in 1-RM SQ and BP were observed across both groups, indicating a time but no specific group effect. Similarly, significant time effects without group effects were found for FFM, MM, FM and muscle thickness (anterior quadriceps femoris at 30%, lateral quadriceps femoris at 50% and PM). Subsequent analyses of the supplement revealed that less than 1% of the claimed 20E concentration and 10.4% of the claimed DSG concentration were present in the capsules. In addition, no biological activity or hypertrophic effects were detected in the C2C12 cells. This study demonstrated that the prescribed resistance training protocol resulted in significant anabolic and performance-enhancing effects that did not differ between groups. The lack of group-specific differences suggests that the tested phytosteroid supplement did not provide additional benefits. The significant discrepancy between the claimed and actual 20E and DSG concentration resulted in the lack of biological activity in C2C12 cells and likely contributed to the absence of measurable group-specific effects. To enhance the reliability of future phytosteroid research, we strongly recommend: (1) verification of active compound concentrations in supplements, its actual content and absence of potential contamination with prohibited substances, (2) confirmation of their biological activity using <i>in vitro</i> models. Implementing these measures will help to minimize inconsistencies and enhance the reliability of future studies on phytosteroids.",

This study evaluates the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), a non-invasive treatment, for patients with IC. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four major databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science) was conducted through March 2025. Eight studies met inclusion criteria for the analysis, which was performed using Review Manager 5.4 with evidence strength assessed by the GRADE system. The analysis included eight studies with a total of 332 patients (mean age &gt;50 years, 67.5% male). Compared to placebo, ESWT demonstrated significant improvements in functional outcomes.

Quality of life was also enhanced, reflected by higher scores on the EQ-5D-3L survey (MD=0.08, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and improvements across SF-36 domains including Physical Function, General Health, Vitality, and Social Functioning. However, ESWT did not produce a significant change in the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) (MD=-0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.05). ESWT is associated with improved walking distance and quality of life in patients with IC. These findings require cautious interpretation due to the limited number of studies and small sample sizes.

    "abstract": "Various weight management practices may have different impacts on weight loss at different time points. The aim of this study was to compare the temporal effectiveness of intermittent fasting (IF) versus calorie-restricted diet (CRD), both combined with exercise, for weight management in overweight and obese adults. Ninety-six overweight/obese adults were voluntarily assigned to either a 5:2 IF combined with moderate exercise (IF group, n = 50) or a CRD combined with moderate exercise (CRD group, n = 46). The intervention timeline included a 4-wk weight loss phase, a 4-wk weight maintenance phase, and follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 mo. Changes in body weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic parameters were compared at different time points. After the 4-wk weight loss period, weight loss in the IF and CRD groups was -4.87 &#xb1; 2.32 kg and -2.82 &#xb1; 1.99 kg, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between groups (P &lt; 0.001). During the 4-wk weight maintenance period, both reduction in body weight and improvements in body composition parameters were observed in both groups (P &lt; 0.05). At 6- and 12-mo follow-ups, participants in both groups regained weight to varying degrees, with more fat mass regain in the CRD group. Our results demonstrate that both IF and CRD, combined with exercise, are effective short-term (4-wk) weight loss strategies. However, long-term follow-ups (6 and 12 mo) revealed that the IF approach may be superior for weight maintenance and show better prevention of weight regain compared with CRD.",

An increasing body of interest has recently focused on the Nutri-Score label; therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to assess its effectiveness in enhancing nutrition literacy, consumers' food choices, adherence to healthy patterns, and health status. Results reveal most studies are conducted in experimental settings with no evidence of nutrition literacy impact and nonsignificant or little effect sizes on eating patterns and health status improvement, particularly in real-life studies. Despite its underpinning algorithm being strongly associated with mortality risk, differences promoted by NutriScore in shopping basket nutrient composition appear limited to saturated fats and sodium with very small effect sizes; moreover, C, D, and E categories seem ineffective in changing consumers' purchases. These findings suggest that expectations for Nutri-Score might be scaled down and require careful consideration for future development in this area.",

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based treatment involving eye movements while retrieving memories. We evaluated if EMD participants had less stress reactivity than retrieval-only participants after personal trauma scripts. We also investigated changes in daily cortisol levels related to treatment outcomes. PTSD participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;91) were randomly assigned to EMD (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;47) or retrieval-only conditions (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;44). Baseline and post-treatment data were collected and measured using Heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate (HR), pre-ejection period (PEP), and cortisol levels (AUC; the area under the curve, and CAR; the cortisol awakening response). We conducted a linear mixed model to analyze the main outcomes. No difference between EMD and retrieval-only in the reduction of stress reactivity and acceleration of recovery over time. Both groups showed that HR and PEP reactivity to the trauma script decreased significantly after treatment. In contrast, only EMD group experienced an acceleration of HR recovery in response to trauma scripts following treatment. Cortisol measures showed an inconsistent pattern, with a higher CAR in retrieval-only after treatment compared to EMD. However, no significant difference was found between groups in terms of AUC levels after treatment. The precision of measuring and analyzing saliva samples is highly dependent on the participant's adherence to the schedule. No specific benefits for eye movements was found in the current study. Both EMDR and retrieval-only can reduce stress reactivity in treating PTSD. [www. gov], identifier [ISRCTN55239132].",

    "title": "Exploring the non-targeted metabolomic landscape in endurance-trained runners following 10 weeks of different dietary patterns and concomitant training.",
    "abstract": "Established guidelines recommend carbohydrate-rich diets to optimize performance in endurance sports. However, alternative dietary strategies, such as the low-arbohydrate and high-fat (LCHF) diet, have gained increasing attention due to their potential to influence metabolic flexibility and endurance performance outcomes. In this study, we aim to investigate the combined effects of a LCHF diet, along with low glycemic index (LOW-GI) and high glycemic index (HIGH-GI) diets, in conjunction with regular endurance exercise, on the metabolomic profiles of recreational runners. The classification into LOW-GI and HIGH-GI groups is based on the premise that metabolic regulation, particularly insulin response and glucose metabolism, differs significantly between the consumption of high-glycemic and low-glycemic foods. The participants (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;49, 28&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4&#x2009;years, BMI: 24.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.8&#x2009;kg/m2, VO2 peak: 56&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8&#x2009;ml/min/kg) were randomly allocated to a LOW-GI (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), a HIGH-GI (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;16) or a LCHF (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) diet for 10&#xa0;weeks and the same endurance training intervention. Fasting plasma samples were collected both pre- and post-intervention and were prepared for non-targeted metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. The LCHF diet had a considerable impact on plasma lipids, whereas the respective effects in the LOW-GI and HIGH-GI groups were less pronounced. Specifically, 179 up- or down-regulated metabolites were identified in the LCHF group, 111 in the LOW-GI group, and 139 in the HIGH-GI group. Phospholipids and sphingolipids were found to be the most prominent metabolites in the samples. Furthermore, the regulation of glycerolipids, carnitine, amino acids, and carbon acids exhibited differential patterns across the groups. There is evidence to suggest that the LCHF diet enhances fat metabolism, as indicated by increased levels of carnitine and ketone bodies, as well as a downregulation of amino acids. Conversely, the presence of specific carbon acids might diminish carbohydrate metabolism and impair endurance performance. In contrast, the LOW-GI group may have demonstrated augmented metabolic flexibility due to the upregulations of both carnitines and carbon acids in the samples. The elevated glycerolipids content in the HIGH-GI group suggests a potential reduction in fatty acid oxidation due to hyperinsulinemia.",

    "abstract": "The milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is a structural membrane that covers the globules of triglycerides dispersed in an emulsion of milk. In previous human studies, MFGM ingestion combined with light aerobic exercise training improved agility in elderly individuals. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 4&#x2009;weeks of daily ingestion of MFGM combined with power training improves instantaneous physical strength - muscle strength, agility, and muscle power compared with placebo (whey protein isolate) in healthy young adults. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. Ninety-eight healthy young adults aged 20-49 completed the study intervention, and they received either an MFGM powder containing 1.7&#x2009;g of fat and 160&#x2009;mg of sphingomyelin or an isocaloric placebo powder daily throughout 4&#x2009;weeks (3 times/week) of power training. Physical strength tests and body composition measurements were conducted before and after the four-week intervention. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline values as a covariate was carried out to test differences in post intervention values between groups. Ingestion of MFGM significantly improved peak torque (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) and average power (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019) of isokinetic knee extensors, leg press 1 repetition maximum (RM) (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) and sit-ups reps (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030), but not indicators of agility, compared with placebo after the 4-week intervention.

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging non-pharmacological tool for reducing stress and anxiety among ICU patients. However, current evidence is limited by small sample sizes, variability in intervention design, and the absence of standardised protocols. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of VR interventions in reducing stress and anxiety. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Medline databases for relevant full-text original English studies published between 2018 and 2024, examining VR interventions to mitigate stress and anxiety in adult (&#x2265;18&#xa0;years) ICU patients. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tools. The main outcome was stress and anxiety. We synthesised the data via systematic review methods and pooled Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A) scores using random-effects meta-analyses. Of 791 studies screened, seven studies (286 participants; 174 post-attrition) were included; four studies had quantitative data suitable for meta-analysis. VR sessions ranged between 5 and 20&#xa0;min, with diverse content and delivery. VAS-A score decreased by 9.22 points (95&#xa0;%CI: -14.84 to -3.61;). Most participants found the VR goggles comfortable (89.3&#xa0;%; 95&#xa0;%CI: 80.5-94.3&#xa0;%;), enjoyed the content (77.2&#xa0;%; 95&#xa0;%CI: 59.6-88.5&#xa0;%), and felt immersed (71.4&#xa0;%; 95&#xa0;%CI: 43.4-89.1&#xa0;%). Acceptability was high, and adverse effects were minimal. VR is feasible, well-accepted, and a safe non-pharmacological alternative to reduce stress and anxiety in ICU patients. However, larger trials with standardised protocols are needed to confirm effectiveness and inform clinical implementation.",

    "title": "Nutritional strategies for minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms during endurance exercise: systematic review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a critical role in achieving peak athletic performance either during training or in competitions. Despite its significance, the GI tract's role in the training process of athletes is often neglected, resulting in frequent GI symptoms. These disturbances are particularly prevalent in endurance sports, where GI function is commonly compromised, leading to adverse effects on performance. In this review, we examine potential nutritional causes of the GI symptoms and provide possible solutions to mitigate them, aiming to enhance athletes' overall performance and well-being. PRISMA methodology was used to search through PubMed Database from January 2023 to March 2023. The selected studies were comprised of randomized controlled trials, crossover trials and case studies. Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The studies were categorized into five distinct areas of research on GI symptoms in endurance exercise: gut training protocols, effects of different carbohydrate solutions and mixtures, low FODMAP diet, hydrogel CHO technology, and probiotic supplementation.Gut training protocols seem promising in improving GI symptoms over time. Optimizing carbohydrate intake during exercise according to current recommendations has been associated with lower incidence and severity of GI symptoms as well. The low FODMAP diet also shows potential to reduce GI symptoms, although its restrictive nature could negatively affect athletes in other ways. Hydrogel carbohydrate products, at present, do not demonstrate any benefits over standard carbohydrate products. Probiotic supplementation shows mixed evidence regarding its effectiveness in alleviating and reducing GI symptoms during endurance exercise. We have acknowledged that the onset of GI symptoms is very complex, and that onset is influenced by a huge variety of factors. It should be emphasized that the elimination of GI symptoms in each athlete must be approached individually and thoughtfully.",

Fourteen studies involving 346 participants met the inclusion criteria. <b>Results:</b> The primary analysis indicated that SS significantly impaired static balance compared to DS (effect size&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.05). No significant differences were observed for dynamic balance or centre of pressure (COP). Meta-regression identified stretching duration as a significant source of heterogeneity, with durations between 20 and 200&#x2009;s associated with better balance outcomes. A visual distribution of effect sizes further supported this optimal duration range for static balance enhancement. <b>Conclusion:</b> Dynamic stretching is more effective than static stretching for improving static balance in healthy adults. Stretching duration plays a critical role, and optimising both the type and timing of stretching interventions may enhance balance performance in athletic and clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of patient education interventions on fasting blood glucose (FBG) in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Electronic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Clinicaltrials.gov was conducted from inception to September 16, 2022. Randomized controlled trials which evaluated the effect of GDM-specific education on biochemical assessment of FBG during pregnancy or within 6&#x2009;weeks postpartum in patients with GDM were included. Meta-analysis was performed of studies reporting FBG using a fixed effects model to determine mean blood glucose difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. Fourteen randomized controlled trials enrolling 1885 patients were included. A total of 8 studies with 893 participants were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The mean effect size was significant: Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.53 (95% CI [-0.67, -0.34], z&#x2009;=&#x2009;-7.36; <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The overall risk of bias for included studies was low. A GDM-specific education intervention resulted in improved glucose control during pregnancy and up to 6&#x2009;weeks postpartum. Due to the number of studies a moderator analysis could not be conducted to determine the most effective educational intervention strategies. More studies are needed to determine efficacious interventions that are cost-effective and can be broadly implemented throughout health systems.",

    "abstract": "Pre-exercise carbohydrate intake is known to influence performance; however, data describing their effect on cardiorespiratory parameters is scarce. This study aimed to assess the effects of isotonic drink consumption on cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) parameters in elitemale youth basketball players. The athletes were randomized into a fasting (400&#x2009;ml mineral water) and an isotonic drink (400&#x2009;ml 7% isotonic solution) group respectively, and consumed the drinks 30&#x2009;minutes before the CPET.

    "title": "Acute effect of a multi-ingredient pre-workout supplement on pacing and kinetic expression during shorter and longer bouts of high intensity functional training.",
    "abstract": "High-intensity functional training (HIFT) varies daily workout programming, and trainees are often tasked with completing \"as many repetitions as possible\" (AMRAP) within a set time. Successful performance depends on fatigue management skills and maintaining a consistent expression of force and velocity when performing and transitioning between exercises over the duration of the workout. Multi-ingredient pre-workout (MIPS) supplement formulations often contain ingredients shown to facilitate energy availability and mitigate fatigue, and therefore, might positively affect HIFT performance. This study aimed to assess a multi-ingredient pre-workout supplement's acute effect on pacing and the expression of kinetics throughout a 5- and 15-minute HIFT-style AMRAP. Twelve men and 10 women (29.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.1&#x2009;years, 171&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7&#x2009;cm, 80.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;15.6&#x2009;kg) with HIFT experience (&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;years) completed four weekly visits, consuming either the supplement (S) or placebo (P) before a 5- or 15-minute AMRAP of rowing (9 or 7 Calories for men and women), six barbell thrusters (43.1&#x2009;kg and 29.5&#x2009;kg), and three jumps onto a box (0.61&#x2009;m and 0.51&#x2009;m). Video recordings of each workout were analyzed to quantify repetitions completed, volume load (kg), and pace (i.e. time spent on each workout component, repetition completion rate). The expression of kinetics and related factors were quantified during rowing via the ergometer microcomputer (Calories per stroke, power [W], and strokes per minute), during barbell thrusters by a 3D motion tracking system (barbell velocity [m &#xb7; sec<sup>-1</sup>] and power [W]), and by in-ground force plates during box jumps (peak and mean force [N], time-to-peak force [ms], rate of force development [RFD; N&#xb7;sec<sup>-1</sup>], and impulse [N&#xb7;sec]). The averages, standard deviation, and slope across rounds were calculated for all pacing and kinetic variables for separate 3-way (sex &#xd7; workout durations &#xd7; supplement conditions) repeated measures analysis of variance comparisons. Men and women completed a greater total volume load (~4.4%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and repetitions at a faster rate (~2.2%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043) during S compared to P and regardless of workout duration. These were best explained by participants completing a greater rowing volume load (~8.1%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) by averaging more powerful strokes (~7.0%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), more consistent transitions to rowing (~11.0%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020), and a trend for faster barbell thruster repetition completion rate (~2.3%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.077). Interestingly, participants varied more across rounds during S (~16.8-29.4%, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) in box jump force expression (peak force, mean force, time-to-peak force, and RFD). No other differences were seen between supplement conditions, only expected differences were seen between men and women and between workout durations. Although it did not affect repetitions completed, the multi-ingredient pre-workout supplement led to a greater volume load and faster overall repetition completion rate. These were primarily due to improvements surrounding rowing performance and evidence of an effect on thruster pacing and box jump force expression. The effects were similar in both sexes and workout durations. Athletes might consider this MIPS formulation to improve HIFT performance, particularly when a workout contains a component that requires sustained, continuous effort.",

    "abstract": "While it is well established that reducing ectopic fat can help prevent insulin resistance in individuals with overweight or obesity, it remains unclear whether diet alone, exercise alone, or their combination is most effective in reducing specific ectopic fat depots. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of diet-only, and combined diet-plus-exercise interventions versus exercise only on ectopic fat reduction, and weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity. Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for original articles, published until 1 March 2024 (no limitation on publication dates) that included diet only/or exercise and diet versus exercise alone on body weight, and ectopic fat in adults with overweight or obesity. Weighted mean differences (WMD) for body weight, liver fat, standardized mean differences (SMD) for visceral fat area (VFA), and intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined using random-effects models. Studies using noninvasive imaging techniques such as Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and hydrogen-based Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (H-MRs) for ectopic fat were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 17 studies, including 732 participants aged 24.27 to 70.5&#x2009;years (309 participants with metabolic diseases, and 423 without metabolic diseases) and 38 intervention groups, met the inclusion criteria. The combined intervention of exercise and diet significantly reduced body weight compared to exercise alone [WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.85&#x2009;kg, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001], with significant reductions observed in both adults with and without metabolic disease, and for interventions lasting more than 12&#x2009;weeks. However, the combined intervention did not significantly reduce liver fat, VFA, or IMTG compared to exercise alone. Diet-only interventions significantly reduced body weight compared to exercise alone [WMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.57&#x2009;kg, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010], but did not significantly affect liver fat, VFA, or IMTG. Meta-regression indicated that weight loss was a significant moderator of the effect of combined interventions on VFA (coefficient: -0.15; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.030), but not for other outcomes. Also, based on subgroup analysis by intervention duration, both exercise and calorie restriction interventions in long-term (more than 12&#x2009;weeks) have been successful in decreasing VFA in adults with overweight/or obesity. Combined exercise and dietary interventions are more effective than exercise alone in reducing body weight. While VFA was reduced following long-term interventions of exercise in combination with caloric restriction, our analyses showed no change in liver fat, or IMTG. Additional investigation is required to delve into the processes behind these findings and to pinpoint treatments that efficiently focus on reducing ectopic fat.",

    "abstract": "Fasting prior to percutaneous cardiac procedures is common, despite a lack of high-quality evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety of a nonfasting strategy. Online databases Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were searched. Quantitative analysis was performed using R software (Version 4.1.2) with meta package. Analyzed outcomes included nausea, vomiting, aspiration, intubation, hypoglycemia, hypotension, acute kidney injury, patient satisfaction score, and length of hospital stay. Eight randomized controlled trials were included with 3,382 patients. There was no significant difference between fasting and nonfasting for nausea/vomiting odds ratio (OR) 0.99 (95% CI, 0.68-1.45), hypoglycemia OR 1.28 (95% CI, 0.75-2.18), aspiration OR 0.72 (95% CI, 0.36-1.43), acute kidney injury OR 0.69 (95% CI, 0.38-1.23), and hypotension OR 1.57 (95% CI, 0.47-5.30). No patient in either group underwent endotracheal intubation. Additionally, there was no difference in patient satisfaction score and length of hospital stay with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.23 (95% CI, -0.62 to 1.07) and 0.0 (95% CI, -0.6 to 0.7) respectively. Sub-group analysis, however, showed increased odds of nausea/vomiting in the fasting group compared to nonfasting OR 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04-1.39) and decreased odds of acute kidney injury in fasting compared to nonfasting group OR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.28-0.89). In conclusion, this analysis shows no significant difference in most safety outcomes between a fasting and a nonfasting strategy with potential increase in nausea/vomiting and decrease in acute kidney injury with fasting.

    "title": "Increasing motivation and well-being among medical students using curricular self-experience group sessions-a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Medical students often face increased stress, reduced well-being, and decreased intrinsic motivation. Deci and Ryan's self-determination theory suggests that intrinsic motivation can be increased through autonomy, relatedness and competence. Intrinsic motivation and relaxation techniques have been shown to reduce stress. Therefore, this pilot study investigates whether promoting relatedness, autonomy and competence through participation in self-experience group therapy increases intrinsic motivation and reduces stress in medical students. A longitudinal randomized controlled trial was conducted with 139 medical students. The students were participants in a one-week psychiatry internship in the winter semester of 2023-4. They were randomly assigned to either a daily relaxation group or self-experience group therapy based on motivational interviewing. Data were collected from pre- and post-internship groups as well as several weeks later using the Self-Regulation Questionnaire for Learning, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Visual Analog Scale for Stress, and the WHO-5 Scale for Well-Being. Focus group interviews were conducted with students and therapists and were thematically analyzed. The students' performance was compared and analyzed. The students in both groups exhibited increased autonomous regulation with respect to learning at the end of the internship (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.29) and improved well-being (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.275) as evaluated via repeated-measures ANOVA.

The self-experience group sessions were well accepted by the students, who preferred these sessions to the relaxation group. No differences were detected at the end of the semester. The integration of self-experience therapy into student teaching is a suitable way of eliciting short-term feelings of relatedness and increasing students' motivation to learn while simultaneously reducing their experiences of stress over a one-week period.",

    "title": "What people with stress-related disorders experience as being supportive for recovery - a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.",
    "abstract": "Prolonged stress leading to sick leave is a serious health problem, and it is crucial to find ways to support recovery. The aim of this review was to synthesize the results from qualitative research about what people with stress-related disorders experience as supportive for recovery. The systematic review was designed as a qualitative meta-synthesis following the recommendations by Walsh and Downe. Our search across PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo identified 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria. These articles were subsequently assessed for quality and analysed. Three themes were identified that describe what people with stress-related disorders experience as supportive for recovery: &#xb4;Engaging and authentic atmospheres-an essentiality for recovery`, &#xb4;Pursuing an empowered and hopeful self`, and &#xb4;Embracing the continuous demanding quest for personal growth`. Recovery from stress-related disorders can be supported by giving each person the opportunity to grow and pursue an empowered and hopeful self. This requires time and support in an engaging and authentic atmosphere. Having the possibility for existential reflection, learning and exploring through various activities is important. Our findings show the importance of formal support that patiently stimulates existential reflection and learning in a non-demanding environment. Implementing activities in clinical practice that stimulate such a process, and which can be adapted to each person's needs and preferences could be beneficial.",

    "title": "Effect of short-term dietary intervention on fecal serotonin, gut microbiome-derived tryptophanase, and energy absorption in a randomized crossover trial: an exploratory analysis.",
    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the effects of short-term energy loads on changes in gut microbiome-derived tryptophanase and fecal serotonin levels and their association with variations in energy absorption. This randomized crossover energy-load intervention study included 15&#xa0;healthy participants subjected to three dietary conditions - overfeeding, control, and underfeeding - for eight days. The effects of the dietary conditions on energy absorption (digestible and metabolizable energy) were assessed using a bomb calorimeter. Fecal serotonin levels were assessed using LC-MS/MS, and the gut microbiota was analyzed using the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun analysis. Significant differences were observed in digestible energy (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), with higher values in the overfeeding than in the control (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032) conditions. Furthermore, significant differences were noted in metabolizable energy and gut transit time (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), both of which were higher in the overfeeding than in the control (metabolizable energy: <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001; gut transit time: <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) and underfeeding (metabolizable energy: <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; gut transit time: <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) conditions. Fecal serotonin levels differed significantly (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), with significantly lower levels in the overfeeding than in the control (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) and underfeeding (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) conditions. Tryptophanase exhibited significant differences (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0019), with lower gene abundance in the overfeeding than in the underfeeding (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) condition. Tryptophanase positively correlated with <i>Bacteroides</i> abundance under all conditions (correlation coefficient: 0.696-0.896). Intra-individual variability in fecal serotonin levels was significantly negatively associated with digestible energy (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009; -0.077, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019). The findings suggest that short-term energy loads dynamically alter fecal serotonin, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and tryptophanase levels. Moreover, changes in fecal serotonin levels might be indirectly associated with energy absorption.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of chronic supplementation with L-Citrulline (LC) vs. L-Citrulline DL-malate (CM) on resistance training (RT) performance. Thirty-three resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to ingest LC (8&#x2009;g), CM (12&#x2009;g), or Placebo (PL) daily, along with participation in a 6-week RT protocol. Muscular strength (1-repetition maximum [1RM] for hack squat [HS] and bench press [BP]), muscular endurance (repetitions to failure [RTF] for HS, leg extension [LE], BP, and incline press [IP]), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and blood biomarkers (lactate, urea, and nitric oxide metabolites [NO<sub>X</sub>]) were assessed before and after the intervention. This study was registered on irct.ir (IRCTID: IRCT20221128056642N1). Comparing mean &#x2206; scores revealed a significant difference between LC and PL (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and between CM and PL (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026) for total upper body (the sum of BP and IP) RTF, but only a trend for difference between LC and PL (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.070) for total lower body (the sum of HS and LE) RTF. A significant time effect for NO<sub>X</sub> was detected only for LC (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) and CM (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). In addition, a significant difference between CM and PL (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and a marginally significant difference between LC and PL (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.057) was detected regarding post-exercise NO<sub>X</sub> values at post-intervention. There were no other between-group differences for any outcome measure. Chronic citrulline supplementation seems to enhance upper body muscular endurance and post-exercise NO<sub>X</sub> response to RT, but there is no apparent difference between LC and CM in these aspects.",

    "title": "Impact of 16/8 time-restricted eating on body composition and lipolytic hormone regulation in female DanceSport dancers.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 16/8 time-restricted eating (TRE) program over 6&#x2009;weeks on body composition and lipolytic hormone levels in female DanceSport dancers. Importantly, participants were not subject to any calorie restrictions during the study period. A total of 20 female DanceSport dancers were recruited to participate in the randomized controlled trial. The participants were randomly assigned to either a time-restricted eating group (TRE, <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) or a control group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;10). The TRE group adhered to a 16/8 time-restricted eating protocol for a period of six weeks, consuming food within an eight-hour window (11:00-19:00) and fasting for 16&#x2009;hours. The control group was instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits without any intervention. Body composition parameters, including body fat percentage (BF%), fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM), were measured before and after the intervention. Additionally, serum levels of epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), adiponectin (ADPN), leptin (LEP), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and blood lipid profiles (including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) were assessed. After 6&#x2009;weeks, the TRE group showed significant reductions in FM and BF% compared to baseline (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). No significant changes were observed in body weight or FFM (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Regarding blood lipid profiles, HDL-C levels significantly increased in the TRE group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) following the 6-week intervention. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in TC, TG and LDL-C (p&gt;0.05). Hormonal analysis revealed significant changes in the TRE group. Serum levels of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) increased significantly following the intervention (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), with E showing a particularly marked increase (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Additionally, serum adiponectin (ADPN) levels were significantly elevated (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), while GH, IGF-1 and LEP levels did not show significant changes (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Group-by-time interactions were observed for FM (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), BF% (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and E (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Comparisons of baseline and post-intervention dietary data indicated no significant changes in total calorie or macronutrient intake within either the TRE or control groups (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Time-restricted eating without caloric restriction may offer a promising approach to regulating body composition and promoting lipid metabolism, especially for female DanceSport dancers where maintaining a lean body mass is critical. However, the long - term effects of this approach still warrant continued observation.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effects of exercise therapy combined with nutritional intervention on muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical function in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients with sarcopenia (SP) through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched multiple databases for RCTs published up to November 2024. Inclusion criteria: patients aged &#x2265;18 with end-stage renal disease receiving MHD and diagnosed with SP; experimental group receiving combined exercise and nutrition intervention, and control group receiving either intervention alone; outcome measures including muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical function. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 15.1. Nine high-quality RCTs involving 513 MHD-SP patients (256 experimental, 257 control) were included. The combined intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in handgrip strength (WMD = 3.78, 95% CI: 2.02-5.53), leg power score (WMD = 5.52, 95% CI: 1.47-9.58), skeletal muscle index (WMD = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.62-1.03), lean body mass (WMD = 2.53, 95% CI: 0.45-4.61), walking speed (WMD = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01-0.22), 6-minute walk test (WMD = 41.37, 95% CI: 20.16-62.58), and 30-second sit-to-stand test (WMD = 3.37, 95% CI: 1.67-5.07). Heterogeneity analysis showed I<sup>2</sup> &#x2264; 50% for all outcomes, indicating robust results. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses confirmed the reliability of the findings.

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Brief psychological interventions in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMICs) have been typically tested against usual or enhanced usual care (EUC). This design precludes understanding of the role of non-specific factors in influencing outcomes.<b>Objective:</b> This study evaluated an adapted version of WHO's Problem Management Plus (gPM+), titled <i>Coping with COVID,</i> against an active control condition to reduce anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.<b>Methods:</b> In this two-arm, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, young adults aged 18-24 years who screened positive for COVID-19 related psychological distress in Bengaluru (India) were randomly allocated to either <i>Coping with COVID</i> (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;91) or non-directive Supportive Counselling (SC; <i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;92) groups. <i>Coping with COVID</i> was a 6-sesion, group-based programme that taught coping strategies for stress. SC was a 6-sesion, group-based programme that offered non-directive support. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS) assessed at baseline, post-intervention, 2-months (primary outcome timepoint), and 6-months after treatment. Secondary outcomes included generalised worry, positive wellbeing, pandemic-related stress, and suicidal ideation.<b>Results:</b> Between October 2021 and December 2022, 183 participants were enrolled into the trial.

Similarly, there were no significant differences between conditions for all secondary outcomes.<b>Conclusions:</b> The findings suggest that the benefits of strategies that comprise transdiagnostic scalable psychological interventions may not surpass non-specific factors in driving symptom reduction.<b>Clinical implications:</b> There is a need to further evaluate the role of non-specific factors in scalable psychological programmes because focusing on these may have implications for ease of training and implementation.<b>Trial registration:</b> Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier: ACTRN12621001064897. Brief scalable psychological interventions tested in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMICs) are effective in the treatment of common mental health problems, but the relative role of specific and non-specific factors in driving this benefit is unknown.Most tests of these interventions utilise inactive control conditions including usual or enhanced usual care.This trial demonstrated that an adapted version of WHO&#x2019;s Problem Management Plus (titled <i>Coping with COVID)</i> targeted towards young adults (aged 18&#x2013;24 years) in Bengaluru, India, did not reduce depression and anxiety relative to non-directive supportive counselling. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Las intervenciones psicol&#xf3;gicas breves en pa&#xed;ses de ingresos bajos y medios (PIBM) por lo general han sido comparadas con los cuidados usuales o los cuidados usuales mejorados (CU).

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the differential effects of resistance training (RT), aerobic training (AT), and concurrent training (CT) on body mass and body fat loss in metabolically healthy individuals. A systematic search of PubMed, SportDiscus, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials published between January 1980 and January 2023, comparing RT, AT, and CT in healthy adults was conducted. Primary outcomes of interest included changes in fat mass and body fat percentage; secondary outcomes were body mass and fat-free mass (FFM). Sub-analyses on intervention duration (&lt; or&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;10&#x2009;weeks), CT timing (aerobic and resistance exercises done on the same day versus different days within a week), and workload matching (equating workloads between AT, RT, and CT), were conducted. Study protocols followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and were pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023396530). In total, 36 studies with 1564 participants were included in the systematic review, with only 31 studies included in the meta-analysis due to missing data. For studies lasting at least 10&#x2009;weeks, AT outperformed RT in reducing body mass (mean difference (MD)&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.82&#x2009;kg [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.72 to -0.93]; <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and fat mass (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.06&#x2009;kg [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.88 to -0.24]; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) but led to less FFM retention (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;- 0.88&#x2009;kg [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.73 to -0.03], <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). CT reduced significantly more fat mass compared to RT (MD: -1.09&#x2009;kg [95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.27 to -1.91]; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). No significant differences were found between CT, AT, and RT in altering body fat percentage (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). For studies shorter than 10&#x2009;weeks, no significant differences were noted across exercise modalities (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Under conditions where AT, RT, and CT workloads were matched, similar fat mass, body mass, body fat percentage, and FFM changes were observed between exercise modalities (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Similar body mass and body fat percentage loss was observed between same-day and different-day CT (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05); body fat mass loss only differed in a single study (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) when comparing RT to different-day CT (aerobic and resistance exercises done on different days within a week). While there are no differences in percent body fat loss between exercise modes, AT and CT are more effective than RT alone in reducing absolute fat mass; however, RT neither improved nor impeded fat mass loss when incorporated into CT. Combining aerobic and resistance exercises on the same-day or different-day does not appear to influence the effectiveness of CT. When exercise interventions are short in duration (&lt;10&#x2009;weeks), there does not appear to be a difference in fat loss between exercise modalities. These results support the concurrent use of aerobic and resistance exercises for fat mass reduction, as well as an emphasis on workload and duration when programming exercise for fat loss.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to a rise in stress-related symptoms, including anxiety and depression, among veterans, necessitating accessible and effective mental health interventions. Traditional rehabilitation resources are often limited, prompting exploration into alternative therapies.<b>Objective:</b> This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of immersive 360&#xb0; video-based Virtual Reality (VR) therapy as an enhancement to standard rehabilitation programmes for Ukrainian veterans experiencing anxiety and depression.<b>Method</b>: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 69 participants, who were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;34), receiving daily VR sessions alongside standard rehabilitation, or the control group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;35), following standard rehabilitation alone. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) both at baseline and post-intervention. Additionally, momentary changes in anxiety and mood were measured immediately before and after each VR session to evaluate the immediate effects. The VR intervention was designed with veteran and expert feedback to enhance emotional regulation and stress resilience, integrating evidence-based psychotherapeutic techniques.<b>Results:</b> Results demonstrate significant rapid improvement in mood and reduction in anxiety following each session, along with significant reductions in anxiety (up to 14.5%) and depression (up to 12.3%) upon programme completion.

    "title": "Impact of carbohydrate timing on glucose metabolism and substrate oxidation following high-intensity evening aerobic exercise in athletes: a randomized controlled study.",
    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of nutrient timing in relation to evening exercise. Specifically, it examined the effects of pre- or post-exercise carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion on glucose metabolism, glucose regulation, and overall substrate oxidation in well-trained athletes during and after physical exercise (PE), spanning the nocturnal period and the subsequent morning. Ten male endurance cyclists participated in the study. The initial assessments included body composition measurements and an incremental cycle test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x2d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math>O2 max) and maximum power output (Wmax). Following this, participants underwent a control (rest previous day) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a familiarization exercise trial that had two objectives: (1) to establish the appropriate amount of CHO to use in the pre- or post-exercise drink during the experimental trials, and (2) to familiarize participants with the equipment and study protocol. In the three days prior to both the control and experimental trials, participants followed a standardized, individualized diet designed to meet their energy needs. During the experimental trials, participants completed two separate evening exercise sessions (50&#x2009;min@70%Wmax&#x2009;+&#x2009; ~24&#x2009;min time-trial (TT)) with either pre- or post-exercise CHO ingestion (253&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;52&#x2009;g), matching the CHO oxidized during exercise. The CHO drink and a volume-matched placebo (PLA) drink (containing no energy) were randomly assigned to be consumed two hours before and directly after the experimental exercise sessions. Post-exercise nocturnal interstitial glucose levels (24:00-06:00) were continuously monitored, and a 120-min OGTT was conducted the following morning to assess substrate oxidation rates and glucose control. Pre-exercise CHO intake significantly lowered capillary glucose levels during steady-state exercise (mean difference 0.41&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.27&#x2009;mmol/L, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) without affecting perceived exertion and TT-performance. No difference was observed in nocturnal glucose regulation (00:00-06:00) regardless of whether CHO was consumed before or after exercise. Post-exercise CHO ingestion reduced glucose tolerance during the OGTT compared to the iso-caloric pre-exercise CHO intake (mean difference 0.76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.21&#x2009;mmol/L, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017). However, a post-exercise CHO intake improved respiratory exchange ratio/metabolic flexibility (MetF) significantly. Enhanced MetF during the first OGTT hour after post-exercise CHO ingestion resulted in 70% and 91% higher CHO oxidation compared to pre-exercise CHO and control, respectively (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.029). Average 120-min OGTT fat oxidation rates were higher with both pre- and post-exercise CHO ingestion compared to control (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.008), with no difference between pre- and post-exercise CHO intake. Morning glucose tolerance was markedly reduced in healthy athletes when CHO was ingested after evening exercise. However, the observed improvements in MetF during the OGTT compared to placebo post-exercise suggest a potential for enhanced athletic performance in subsequent exercise sessions. This opens exciting possibilities for future research to explore whether enhanced MetF induced by CHO-timing can translate to improved athletic performance, offering new avenues for optimizing training and performance.",

    "title": "Individual responses to encapsulated caffeine and caffeine chewing gum on strength and power in strength-trained males.",
    "abstract": "Liquid-dissolved and encapsulated powder are two popular ways to consume caffeine for performance-enhancing effects. Caffeine in other delivery methods, such as chewing gums, orally dissolvable strips, gels, mouthwashes, energy drinks, and nasal sprays, is believed to be absorbed more quickly into the bloodstream. Inter-individual responses to caffeine's enhancing effects are recognized. The present study examined the inter-individual responses to the acute effects of encapsulated caffeine and caffeinated chewing gum on the lower-body isokinetic and isometric strength and power in strength-trained males. A randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 15 strength-trained males (age: 25&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;&#x2009;4&#x2009;years, height: 176&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;&#x2009;7&#x2009;cm, weight: 75&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;&#x2009;11&#x2009;kg, habitual caffeine intake: 66&#x2009;&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;&#x2009;15&#x2009;mg&#xb7;day<sup>-1</sup>). Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: i) caffeinated chewing gum (CG), ii) caffeine capsule (CC), and iii) starch capsule as a placebo (PLA). Participants consumed approximately 3 to 4.5&#x2009;mg&#xb7;kg<sup>-1</sup> of caffeine 60&#x2009;minutes before testing. The washout period between conditions was one week. Participants performed the Sargent jump test, followed by a 5-minute active recovery (walking). Subsequently, isokinetic strength and power (60&#xb0;/s and 180&#xb0;/s) and isometric strength (45&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;) parameters were measured for knee extensor and flexor muscles. Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests, with significance set at <i>p</i>&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05. Responders to the caffeine conditions were identified using the smallest worthwhile change (SWC) analysis. In knee extensors, 1) average peak torque and power at 60&#xb0;/s were higher in CC (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045;&#x2009;+&#x2009;11.2% and <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038;&#x2009;+&#x2009;14.1%) and CG (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.044;&#x2009;+&#x2009;7.3% and <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015;&#x2009;+&#x2009;11.4%) compared to PLA with a co-response rate of 60% and 66%, 2) maximum voluntary isometric contraction at 45&#xb0; (MVIC-45&#xb0;) was higher in CC compared to PLA (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031;&#x2009;+&#x2009;10.1%), and 3) MVIC-60&#xb0; was higher in CG compared to PLA (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037;&#x2009;+&#x2009;10.1%) with a co-response rate of 60%. In knee flexors, 1) time to peak torque at 60&#xb0;/s was higher in CG compared to PLA (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011;&#x2009;+&#x2009;18.2%) with a co-response rate of 46%, 2) average rate of force development at 60&#xb0;/s was higher in CC (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007;&#x2009;+&#x2009;24.1%) and CG (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.050;&#x2009;+&#x2009;20.6%) compared to PLA with a co-response rate of 53%, and 3) average power at 180&#xb0;/s was higher in CC compared to PLA (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033;&#x2009;+&#x2009;18%) with a co-response rate of 46%. However, there were no differences between other strength indicators in the knee extensors and flexors between the different conditions. Vertical jump height (VJH) was higher in CC (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001;&#x2009;+&#x2009;5.5%) and CG (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001;&#x2009;+&#x2009;6.) compared to PLA, with a co-response rate of 53%. Caffeine supplementation in CC and CG forms significantly enhanced lower-body strength, power, and vertical jump height in strength-trained males, with over&#x2009;&#x2009;~50% of participants exceeding the SWC thresholds across key performance metrics. CC showed slightly higher responder rates for strength parameters, while CG excelled in time-dependent measures, supporting their use as effective and flexible ergogenic aids.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal opioid use disorder (OUD) remains a public health epidemic. Stress, anxiety and depression are disproportionately high among this population and are associated with poor recovery outcomes. Mindfulness interventions show promise for supporting recovery for women. This paper reports results of a pilot study to evaluate initial efficacy and acceptability of digitally delivered mindfulness meditation videos to reduce stress and promote mindfulness among women in recovery. Women with lived experience of OUD were recruited from three outpatient programs that provided care to pregnant and parenting women with a history of opioid use in rural northern New England (2 maternity care settings that offered buprenorphine as part of their service menu and 1 academic substance use treatment setting). In a pre-post study design, participants were randomly assigned to receive four of 16 short meditation videos, each delivered by email in a survey link over a 2-week period (2 per week) Videos were co-designed in earlier work with representative end-users, guided by evidence-based mindfulness interventions. Assessment included the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale. Participants rated each video on usefulness, enjoyability, ability to lower anxiety, and intention to use in the future. Participants also provided open-ended feedback about the videos. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and generalized linear modeling. A total of 20 women, ages 24-36&#x2009;years, completed the pilot study. Most participants (95%) were white and non-Hispanic, reflecting the rural region. Marginal mean perceived stress scores decreased significantly from 21.49 to 19.85 [<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43] and mean mindfulness scores increased significantly from 3.47 to 3.76 [<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45]. Overall, the meditation videos were rated as highly acceptable and useful and a majority (80%) indicated intention to use the meditations in the future. Digitally delivered meditation videos were highly acceptable and useful to participants and the low dose intervention reduced stress and improved mindfulness. Findings inform directions for future research with larger samples to evaluate the effectiveness of this accessible digital intervention to support women in recovery and strategies for broadly implementing the intervention. A low dose of a digitally delivered meditation video intervention significantly reduced perceived stress and improved mindfulness in women with opioid use disorder.The meditation videos were highly acceptable and useful to participants and the digital implementation was demonstrated feasible.Participant feedback informed further refinements of meditation videos to promote engagement.The pilot study seeds a strong foundation from which to conduct larger, fully powered randomized controlled studies to evaluate effectiveness and implementation of a digital delivered meditation intervention to support recovery for women with opioid use disorder.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Adolescent depression patients who have experienced stressful life events usually have more severe symptoms. Existing treatment plans are not effective in reducing the high recurrence rate of adolescent depression. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), an integrative therapy, can effectively alleviate depressive symptoms, but the evidence of its effectiveness in treating adolescent depression is still insufficient.<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of EMDR in combination with medication in treating depressed adolescents.<b>Methods:</b> A total of 30 adolescent patients with depression were recruited and randomly divided into two groups: EMDR co-treated with an SSRI medication or an SSRI medication used alone. The intervention group received standardised EMDR treatment. The primary outcome indicators were the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) and the Impact of Events Scale (IES-R), while the secondary outcomes were the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES).<b>Results:</b> In the end, 30 people completed the experiment, 15 from each of the intervention and control groups.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness and practicality of time-restricted eating (TRE) when trying to maximize muscle mass and strength is unclear. Thus, we examined the effects of a hypercaloric 16:8 TRE approach during supervised progressive resistance exercise. Seventeen healthy and well-trained men (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;10) and women (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;7) were randomly assigned to TRE or control (FED). Both groups consumed a 10% hypercaloric high-protein (2.2&#x2009;g/kg/d) diet and performed supervised resistance exercise 4&#xd7; per wk for 8&#x2009;wk. TRE consumed all calories within an 8&#xa0;h window starting at least 1&#x2009;h post-exercise, while FED consumed the same number of calories throughout the day. Eating windows were significantly different (TRE: 7.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.1&#x2009;h vs. FED: 13.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;h). Calorie, carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake did not differ statistically between groups. Total exercise volume was significantly lower in TRE than FED (6,960&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;287 vs. 7,334&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;289 repetitions), as were subjective daily energy ratings (week 4&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.41; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, week 8&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.04; <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06). Both groups increased maximal upper and lower body strength (1RM) and muscular endurance (ME); however, gains in squat 1RM were 4.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;kg lower in TRE (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Both groups increased fat-free mass similarly (TRE: 2.67&#x2009;kg; FED: 1.82&#x2009;kg, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04), but FED added 1.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.6&#x2009;kg more fat mass (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Subjective mood and sleep ratings did not change in either group. 16:8 TRE is viable during periods of muscle size, strength, and endurance development in well-trained young men and women when engaging in progressive resistance exercise and eating in a caloric surplus with adequate protein. However, the differences in total training volume, squat 1RM, fat mass accumulation, and energy are notable and practically relevant. These findings should be considered within the broader context of an individual's goals, lifestyle, preferences, and exercise demands.",

    "abstract": "Competitive swimmers have a high prevalence of sports supplement (SS) consumption. However, only a few SS are scientifically proven to be safe, effective, and legal. Therefore, before incorporating supplements to enhance performance and health in competitive swimming, it is crucial to conduct an analysis and review to assess their effects. The objective of this study was to analyze the demonstrated effects of SS, as reported in published studies, on the swimming performance of competitive swimmers. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across six databases for the selection of studies included in this review. Studies that analyzed the effects of sports supplementation compared to placebo were included and subjected to meta-analysis. This revision included 23 studies, 16 of them (69.6%) qualified as excellent and 7 (30.4%) as good at the methodological level based on the punctuation in the PEDro scale. The systematic review included 422 swimmers (61.8% male, 38.2% female), with distances assessed ranging from 50&#x2009;m to 800&#x2009;m, including studies employing interval procedures.

    "abstract": "Exercise benefits patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) by addressing complications and dysfunctions. Elastic band exercise is cost-effective, but its safety, efficacy, and feasibility during dialysis are not well-established. The aim of this study is to investigate the physical and mental effects of intradialytic elastic band exercise in patients on MHD. Sixty patients on MHD were randomly assigned to the exercise or control group (30 patients/group).

    "title": "Physical activity interventions in adult kidney transplant recipients: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) exhibit a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and adverse changes in physical fitness and body composition. Post-transplant management recommends being physically active and evidence in this field is growing. The aim of this review was to update our previous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of physical activity and exercise training interventions in KTRs. A comprehensive literature search between March 2021 and September 2024 identified seven additional RCTs. Therefore, this updated review and meta-analysis includes 23 RCTs. Outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), strength, blood pressure, body composition, heart rate, markers of dyslipidemia and kidney function, and health-related quality of life. Twenty-three RCTs, including 1,139 KTRs, were included. The median intervention length was 12&#xa0;weeks with participants exercising between 2 and 7&#xd7;/week. Most studies used a mixture of aerobic and resistance training but reporting and intervention content was highly varied. Significant improvements were observed in CRF (V&#x307;O<sub>2peak</sub>; +3.87&#x2009;mL/kg/min, <i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0004), physical function (sit-to-stand-60; +7.72 repetitions, <i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;.0001), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL; +0.13&#x2009;mmol/L, <i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;.02). Isolated studies reported improvements in strength, bone health, lean mass, and quality of life (QoL). All studies were found to have a high or moderate risk of bias. Exercise training or increasing physical activity may confer several benefits in adult KTRs, especially through the improvements in CRF and HDL which have been linked to CVD risk. Despite new literature, there is still a need for long-term larger sampled RCTs and more detailed reporting of intervention details and program adherence.",

    "title": "Efficacy of time restricted eating and resistance training on body composition and mood profiles among young adults with overweight/obesity: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Dietary restriction or exercise regimens can promote weight loss or physical fitness among patients with obesity. However, intervention-associated adverse effects may impede patients' motivation to participate in dietary/exercise interventions. We examined the effects of time restricted eating (TRE) with or without resistance training (RT) on body composition, mood profile, and sleep quality in young college adults with overweight or obesity. Fifty-four young college students with overweight/obesity were randomized into control (CON), TRE, RT, and TRE plus RT (TRE+RT) trials. The TRE trials restricted to an eating window of 10-hour/day for 8-week. The RT trials performed supervised resistance exercise, while the control trial maintained a regular lifestyle. Changes in body composition variables, blood pressure, mood status, and sleep quality were measured before and after the intervention. TRE intervention alone or in combination with RT significantly (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) decreased body weight (&gt;2&#x2009;kg) and BMI (~1&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in adults with overweight/obesity. Both RT alone and combined with TRE substantially decreased fat mass by 1.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.5 and 3.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.4&#x2009;kg, respectively. The decreased fat mass was greater in the combination trial than in the RT trial, whereas TRE alone had no effect. In contrast, fat-free mass was significantly (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) decreased with TRE (-2.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;06&#x2009;kg), increased with RT (1.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.3&#x2009;kg), and was stably maintained with combination interventions. The reduced waist and hip circumferences in the TRE (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) were similar to those in the TRE+RT trials, however, RT alone had no effect. Time and group interaction showed a large effect size (partial eta squared) for all body composition variables. In addition, RT with or without TRE notably decreased diastolic blood pressure (RT: -5.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.9&#x2009;mmHg, TRE+RT: -4.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;mmHg, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Mild anxiety levels at baseline in RT (4.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6) and TRE+RT (4.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3) trials were found to be normal at postintervention in TRE+RT (3.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.7) but not in RT (5.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.5). No depression or stress was recorded among the participants during the intervention. The reported poor sleep quality among participants at baseline was significantly improved with RT (4.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.9; <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and tended to improve with TRE+RT interventions (4.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.9). 10-hour TRE is beneficial for weight/fat loss without affecting mood status. However, TRE combined with RT might be more effective for weight/fat loss, maintaining muscle mass, and good quality of sleep among young adults with overweight or obesity.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of a comprehensive nursing intervention targeting high water and salt intake on blood pressure and volume burden in patients with chronic renal failure. From January 2020 to January 2023, 120 patients diagnosed with chronic renal failure were treated at our hospital. Participants were randomly allocated to either a control group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) receiving standard dietary education or an observation group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) receiving intensive water-salt diet nursing intervention alongside standard education. Blood pressure, volume load, and related parameters were compared after a 6-month observation period. Both groups exhibited reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure post-intervention (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The observation group demonstrated a significantly lower extracellular water-to-total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) compared to the control group (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

    "abstract": "This research was to explore the effectiveness, safety, and adherence of home-based strength and balance exercises for fall prevention among the self-reliant individuals of advanced age and analyzed the beneficial components. This randomized controlled single-blind study included 124 individuals aged 80 years and over(mean age 84.4&#xb1;3.2 years). The test group (<i>n</i>=63) performed strength and balance exercises facilitated by sports video training (&#x2265; 3 sessions a week, &#x2265; 30 minutes per session), while the control group (<i>n</i>=61) maintained their daily routines. We conducted a comprehensive geriatric assessment (self-care ability, muscle strength, mobility, cognition, and psychological status) at baseline and 12 months later and dynamic posture mapping for balance and gait. The test group had a decreased risk of falls compared to the control group (25.4%vs.44.3%, respectively; RR = 0.747; 95% CI: 0.551-0.975; <i>p</i> = 0.027). There was no statistically significant difference in the fall rate between the two groups (0.48 falls per person-year vs. 0.67 falls per person-year, respectively; IRR: 0.708; 95% CI: 0.394-1.275; <i>p</i> = 0.251). The composite equilibrium score (SOTcom) for vestibular and integrated balance on the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) increased in the test group, while SOTcom decreased in the control group. In the test group, there was a significant improvement in the indexes pertaining to response time, movement speed, directional control, and endpoint offset in some directions. Adherence was better in the test group, with 54.0% exercised &#x2265; 3 times per week and 28.6% exercised 1-2 times per week on average.

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate differences in cardiopulmonary fitness between healthy controls and children/adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the effects of exercise training. PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for published studies from reception to 14 June 2023, and updated search on 15 October 2023. The included observational studies reported on cardiorespiratory fitness, included maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>), peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), in children/adolescents with CKD and age-matched healthy controls, as well as clinical intervention trials of exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness in samples of children and/or adolescents up to 19. Fifteen observational studies and five clinical trials were included, respectively. The studies found that the mean cardiopulmonary fitness was 1.82 standardized mean differences (SMDs) units (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.43-2.20) lower in children/adolescents with CKD than in healthy controls or reference values. Except for pre-dialysis CKD patients, peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis and kidney transplant recipients had significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness than healthy controls. The results of a meta-analysis based on a pre-post single-arm trial showed that compared to baseline, exercise training improved the 6MWD by approximately 58.17&#xa0;m (95% CI 16.27-100.06), with very low evidence. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and clinical trials that included children/adolescents with CKD found that cardiorespiratory fitness is severely reduced in this population and that exercise training may be an effective strategy for improvement. Given the low evidence certainty, additional high-quality trials are necessary. Cardiorespiratory fitness in children/adolescents with CKD was approximately 12.38&#x2009;mL/kg/min (SMD: 1.82; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.43&#x2013;2.20) lower than in age-matched healthy controls.Exercise intervention improves 6-minute walking distance in children/adolescents with CKD (MD: 58.17; 95% CI 16.27&#x2013;100.06).Assessment of physical functioning should be incorporated into daily clinical practice for children/adolescent CKD patients.",

    "abstract": "Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome associated with poor clinical outcomes. Effectiveness of lifestyle intervention programmes among frail older people has been examined earlier, but effects of interventions on prevention of frailty have been rarely studied. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent the multidomain lifestyle intervention in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) affected changes in frailty status among older men and women at risk of cognitive disorders. The 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention trial including simultaneous nutritional counseling, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors, was conducted among 1259 older people (mean age 68.9&#x2009;years). A modified Fried's frailty phenotype (weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, and low physical activity) was used to assess frailty at baseline and after the 2-year intervention. Participants with one or more components of the frailty phenotype were classified as pre-frail or frail. A multinomial regression model was applied to investigate efficacy of the intervention on frailty. We observed a favorable trend in reversing frailty among older men with the intervention. Pre-frail or frail men in the intervention group had higher probability of being non-frail after the intervention (44%) than pre-frail or frail men in the control group (30%) (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.040). Among men, the intervention was especially beneficial in terms of increasing physical activity. Among women, multidomain lifestyle intervention did not affect the frailty status. Modifying lifestyle-related factors may have potential to reverse first signs of frailty among older men. However, the intervention lasted only two years, therefore, research with longer follow-up is needed to see possible long-term effects of lifestyle management on the development of frailty.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain encompasses both physiological and psychological dimensions, often manifesting alongside anxiety and depression. Exercise interventions have been identified as potential strategies for addressing these psychological concerns. Accordingly, this meta-analysis seeks to systematically evaluate the effects of exercise on anxiety and depression among individuals with chronic pain. A comprehensive search across four electronic databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that assessed the impact of exercise interventions on these psychological outcomes. A random-effects model was employed to synthesize the data from the identified studies. The meta-analysis included 28 studies, comprising 2265 participants with chronic pain. Of these, 22 studies contributed to the analysis of anxiety outcomes, while all 28 studies contributed to the analysis of depression outcomes. The findings revealed that anxiety scores in the exercise intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group [SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.39, 95&#xa0;% CI (-0.55, -0.23), P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001], and depression scores also showed a significant reduction [SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.33, 95&#xa0;% CI (-0.44, -0.21), P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001]. Furthermore, notable subgroup differences emerged concerning exercise modalities and types of chronic pain. The meta-analysis findings suggest that exercise interventions can alleviate anxiety and depressive symptoms among chronic pain patients. Further high-quality studies are required to refine the comparison of different exercise modalities across diverse chronic pain populations.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the symptom-symptom interactions of sleep quality, depression, and anxiety in Chinese nurses and to compare a multimorbidity group, a comorbidity group, and a healthy group via a network model. A total of 7113 Chinese nurses were recruited from sixty hospitals in January 2024, and their sleep quality, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), respectively. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified on the basis of centrality indices and bridge centrality indices, respectively. Network stability was examined using the case-dropping procedure. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and poor sleep quality were 40.02&#xa0;%, 29.03&#xa0;% and 65.81&#xa0;%, respectively. The most central symptom was \"Depressed affect\", followed by \"Panic\" in the entire sample and the multimorbidity group. The main symptoms in the multidisease group and the healthy group were PSQI 6 (\"Daytime dysfunction\") and SDS18 (\"Hypnotic drugs\"). The most common bridge symptom was \"Insomnia\", followed by \"Sleep disturbance\", in the entire sample and the three groups. The bootstrap test indicated that the entire network model was stable, and there were network differences in global strength between the multimorbidity group, the comorbidity group, and the healthy group. Comorbidity of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality are relatively common among nurses. This study employed network analysis to identify pivotal central symptoms and bridging symptoms (such as \"Insomnia\" and \"Sleep disturbance\"), which should be prioritized as key intervention targets. Regular mental health screenings for nurses, with particular attention to high-risk populations, may help alleviate comorbid symptoms and improve sleep quality.",

    "abstract": "Stress from daily psychosocial challenges is a significant health concern with limited pharmacological treatment options. Psychosocial stress triggers distinct responses in the autonomic and central nervous systems, measurable via heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalogram (EEG). This post hoc analysis of clinical trial data explores the impact of the anti-stress medication Neurexan (Nx4) on HRV and EEG signals, and their correlation in a resting state following acute psychosocial stress induction. Data from the NEURIM trial (NCT02602275), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study, were utilized. Participants received Nx4 before exposure to ScanSTRESS, a psychosocial stress paradigm. EEG and photoplethysmogram data were collected at rest before and after stress exposure. Stress responsivity under both placebo and Nx4 conditions was evaluated through HRV and EEG signals. Psychosocial stress altered HRV parameters (increased LF/HF ratio, elevated Baevsky's Stress Index, reduced RMSSD) and EEG activity (decreased aperiodic offset, increased alpha power). Nx4 significantly mitigated stress-induced changes in LF/HF ratio, Baevsky's Stress Index, and aperiodic offset. A significant correlation was observed between Nx4 effects on HRV and EEG activity. Nx4 attenuates peripheral and central physiological stress responses, suggesting a comprehensive approach to mitigating stress responses in daily life.",

    "abstract": "High-risk pregnancies present significant psychological challenges for affected women, and psychosocial interventions may improve their mental health and quality of life. To evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial occupational therapy interventions for managing anxiety, depression, stress, and quality of life among women with high-risk pregnancies. CINAHL, SocIndex, AMED, Embase via Ovid, MEDLINE in PubMed, Cochrane Library, OTseeker, and PsycINFO. This systematic review followed Cochrane Collaboration methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies included women with high-risk pregnancies (e.g., gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, preterm labor) and examined occupational therapy-related psychosocial interventions. Eligible studies reported outcomes for anxiety, depression, stress, or quality of life and were classified as Level 1b, 2b, or 3b evidence. Data were analyzed using narrative synthesis. Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Cognitive-based and counseling-based interventions showed moderate to strong effectiveness in reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. Emotion-based approaches had low to moderate effectiveness, and sensory-based interventions were largely ineffective. Integrated approaches, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, showed mixed results. Findings support integrating psychosocial interventions into occupational therapy to enhance mental health and occupational engagement for women with high-risk pregnancies. Plain-Language Summary: This study reviewed 34 studies of psychosocial interventions for women with high-risk pregnancies. Cognitive and counseling-based strategies were most effective in reducing anxiety, depression, and stress. Sensory-based approaches had little impact. These findings reinforce the role of occupational therapists in supporting mental health and inform future practice and education.",

    "abstract": "This randomised controlled feasibility study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a main study and provide a first assessment of whether the exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) response differs depending on the training modalities in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and whether it can be enhanced by education about pain. People with knee OA (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;36, 60&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11&#x2009;years, WOMAC total 51.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;36.6) were randomly assigned to receive lower body resistance training (RTL), upper body resistance training (RTU), or aerobic training (AET). Each participant performed three training sessions (t1, t2, t3) separated by 1&#x2009;week, and education about pain and EIH after t2. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured at six sites before (PPT0), immediately after (PPT1), and 30&#x2009;min after (PPT30) each training session. Feasibility was assessed using indicators for practicability, acceptance, and safety. This study's procedures were deemed feasible, including high acceptance of the measurement method and educational information, well-tolerated training exercises, and a dropout rate of 8%. In each group and after each session, an EIH response could be detected at PPT1 and PPT30 (Cohen's d &#x2265;&#x2009;0.5 to &#x2265;&#x2009;0.8). At most measurement sites, effect sizes tended to be largest after RTL and at t3. Progression to a larger study is warranted. RTL, but also AET and RTU may induce EIH in people with knee OA. Pain education might have a useful supporting function, but its effect would need to be determined in a study design using a control group that receives training and no education. Lower body resistance training, but also aerobic training and upper body resistance training may induce hypoalgesia in people with knee osteoarthritis. Being less pain sensitive after performing various exercise training modalities provides a significant benefit and can improve the quality of life of people with knee OA. If confirmed in a larger study, these findings might also allow better consideration of patients' individual preferences and potential comorbidities for exercise prescription.

    "title": "Role of Latissimus Dorsi-Thoracolumbar Fascia Complex Stretching on Pain and Pain-Related Parameters in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomised Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Fascial stretching is gaining interest as a potential intervention for pain management. However, evidence regarding the effect of latissimus dorsi-thoracolumbar fascia (LD-TLF) complex stretching in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) remains limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of LD-TLF complex stretching on pain-related factors and disability in patients with CLBP. Thirty patients with CLBP were randomly assigned to a study group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15; 7 men, 8 women) and a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15; 7 men, 8 women). The study group received 4&#x2009;weeks of LD-TLF complex stretching in combination with conventional physiotherapy, while the control group received conventional physiotherapy only. Outcomes were assessed before and after the interventions, including primary measures of pain pressure thresholds (PPT) at thoracolumbar fascia levels (L1, L3 and 12th costa), and secondary measures included the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ), the effects of pain on daily activities measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and disability assessed by the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ). Pre- and post-treatment PPTs, at the L1, L3 vertebrae and 12th costa levels, demonstrated significant differences between the study group and control groups. Post-treatment thresholds were significantly higher compared to pre-treatment thresholds (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.61; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74). Additionally, significant improvements were found in PSC, BPI and ODQ scores in the study group compared to the control group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The results of this study suggest that stretching the LD-TLF complex may be a beneficial addition to the conventional physiotherapy approach for patients with CLBP. Specifically, LD-TLF complex stretching, when used in combination with conventional physiotherapy, appears to provide improved pain thresholds, decreased pain sensitivity and pain during activity, as well as reduced disability compared to conventional physiotherapy alone in patients with CLBP. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a multifactorial condition, with the thoracolumbar fascia increasingly recognized as a potential contributing factor. This study suggests that stretching the latissimus dorsi-thoracolumbar fascia complex in combination with conventional physiotherapy, enhances pain thresholds, reduces pain sensitivity, and decreases disability in individuals with CLBP. Incorporating fascia-specific interventions into CLBP treatment programs could offer significant benefits for both patients and clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Nonceliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is characterized by gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms triggered by gluten ingestion. Its symptomatology overlaps substantially with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), leading to diagnostic challenges. Data on the prevalence and predictors of NCWS among patients with IBS or FD, especially those with refractory symptoms, are limited. We aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical predictors, and impact of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in this population using the Salerno Experts' Criteria. In this prospective, multicenter trial, adults (18-65 years) with Rome IV-defined IBS or FD, refractory to standard therapy, were enrolled. Participants underwent a 6-week GFD; gluten responders subsequently underwent a double-blind placebo-controlled gluten challenge (DBPCGC) with crossover. Symptom trajectories, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety, and depression were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of NCWS. Trial registration number- CTRI/2021/10/037323. Of 252 screened patients, 177 were enrolled for a 6-week GFD (step I), and 154 patients completed this phase (mean age 41.9&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;14.2 years, 53.2% males). Eighty-two (52.3%) patients responded to GFD, of whom 77 entered step II (DBPCGC). Thirty-one (20.1%) patients had significant symptom worsening on blinded gluten ingestion, suggesting the presence of NCWS. Female sex, FD-IBS overlap, headache, fatigue, and anxiety independently predicted NCWS. GFD was associated with significant HRQOL improvement. Approximately one-fifth of the patients with refractory IBS/FD fulfill the NCWS criteria. Therefore, screening for NCWS in patients with refractory IBS or FD is extremely important to limit unnecessary pharmacotherapy and enhance patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) tend to have abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) characterized by hypo- or hyperactivity, and early life stress (ELS) events influence the HPA axis, resulting in a heightened risk of depression. We conducted a systematic review evaluating the existing literature to summarise whether the HPA axis abnormalities in MDD are associated with ELS. This review was conducted following the PRISMA framework. In April 2024, searching was conducted on Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, and APA PsycINFO. Keywords were based on three clusters of constructs: \"HPA axis,\" \"MDD,\" and \"ELS.\" Studies comparing the HPA axis activity in participants with and without unipolar depression and ELS were included. Quality assessment was conducted with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool. Among the 17 included studies, 6 examined the naturalistic HPA axis activity, 7 conducted functional tests, and 4 performed psychosocial stress tests. The hypo- and hyperactive HPA axis was observed in most studies in depressed patients with ELS. Depressed patients with ELS and abused controls also manifested abnormal HPA axis activity compared to healthy controls. HPA axis abnormality is associated with depressive pathology, and ELS has an independent effect on the HPA axis. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with HPA axis hypoactivity either alone or as an MDD comorbidity. HPA axis hyperactivity in MDD with or without ELS may dampen over time, and an imbalance may implicate HPA axis abnormalities in depressed patients with ELS in the negative feedback.",

Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) is an early palliative care intervention that has previously been evaluated in a randomized trial among AYAs receiving HCT; results suggested the intervention's effect was limited to AYAs with baseline psychological symptoms. We performed a post hoc analysis of these same data to explore differences in response based on sociodemographic factors. AYA participants were eligible for the trial if they were 12-24&#xa0;years old, English-speaking, cognitively able, and within 4&#xa0;weeks of HCT for malignancy or bone marrow failure. Enrolled AYAs reported their symptoms of anxiety, depression, hope, cancer-related quality of life, and resilience using standardized instruments at baseline and 6&#xa0;months. We explored intervention effect sizes (Cohen's d) among groups stratified by gender, age, race, zip-code-based community distress (Distressed Community Index, with scores 3-5 indicating distressed communities), and baseline psychological symptoms. Of 94 participants (50 PRISM, 44 Usual Care), 46% were female, 44% were 18-24&#xa0;years old, 60% identified as non-Latino White, and 49% lived within distressed communities. Among AYAs 18-24&#xa0;years old, those with baseline psychological distress tended toward gaining resilience, while those without baseline psychological symptoms seemed to gain hope. AYAs of all ages from distressed communities and with high baseline psychological burden seemed to gain both resilience and hope.

    "title": "Sensitive periods to social adversity in immune and metabolic development: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Childhood exposure to social adversity - including experiences such as poverty, discrimination, violence, family separation, household dysfunction, and maltreatment - is associated with cardiometabolic health problems across the life course. A key question in the field is whether the timing of social adversity matters. To better understand the developmental origins of cardiometabolic disease and the emergence of health disparities, we conducted a systematic review of human observational studies to synthesize the evidence for sensitive periods to social adversity in immune and metabolic development. To be included in the study, some form of social adversity had to be independently reported at two or more non-overlapping time points during the prenatal period or childhood (&lt;21 years old) and studies were required to include an outcome relevant to immune and/or metabolic biomarkers measured at some time after the social adversity exposure. Of the 2440 unique records screened, 25 met criteria for inclusion. Twenty studies investigated sensitive periods in immune development and six in metabolic development. For immune development, studies identified sensitive periods to social adversity inconsistently from the prenatal period through age 18. However, the proportion of studies confirming sensitive periods was highest at the youngest stages of development and gradually decreased across the life course. 50&#x202f;% of studies found significant sensitive period effects in the prenatal period, while only 20&#x202f;% found significant effects in late adolescence. For metabolic development, studies identified sensitive periods more consistently from birth through age 12. The proportion of studies reporting sensitive periods peaked at 50&#x202f;% in infancy and decreased to zero after preadolescence. Overall, we found insufficient evidence to identify precise periods during which specific social adversity exposures have been consistently associated with altered immune and metabolic development. More birth cohorts with repeated measures of both social exposures and immune and metabolic biomarkers are needed, as are studies leveraging causal inference methods to more robustly account for time-varying confounding. However, these limitations notwithstanding, our review finds evidence that early experiences matter for immune and metabolic functioning. Improving the social and economic circumstances of young children may benefit lifelong cardiometabolic health.",

However, poor adherence has threatened its effectiveness. To optimize a previously developed complex intervention to enhance its efficiency and disseminability. 2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;2 full factorial randomized trial. This study was conducted at five community health service centers in Hunan Province, China. A total of 114 pre-frail or frail community-dwelling older adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight intervention groups (corresponding to all possible combinations of the three implementation components of goal setting, feedback and reinforcement guidance) to receive a 12-week intervention, with all receiving the core intervention (group elastic-band resistance exercise and community education). Outcomes were measured at baseline, 6&#xa0;weeks, and 12&#xa0;weeks. Primary outcomes included frailty and resistance exercise adherence. Mean difference (MD) and 95&#xa0;% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate effectiveness using a linear mixed-effects model. Intervention costs were assessed from the viewpoint of service providers (community organizations and research teams). The goal-setting on group exhibited statistical significance in improving frailty (week 6: MD: -0.25, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.47 to -0.02) and resistance exercises adherence (week 6: MD: 6.37, 95&#xa0;% CI: 2.40 to 10.30; week 12: MD: 6.42, 95&#xa0;% CI: 2.45 to 10.40).

    "title": "Effects of non-pharmacological interventions on physical activity and sedentary behaviour among patients with coronary heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Adequate physical activity is a well-known protective factor against recurrent cardiac events. Emerging evidence also showed that sedentary behaviour is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. It is thereby essential to identify effective strategies that improve these movement behaviours, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, among patients with coronary heart disease. This systematic review aims to identify the best available evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in promoting physical activity and/or reducing sedentary behaviours among patients with coronary heart disease. Randomised controlled trials that examine the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on physical activities or sedentary behaviours or both among patients with coronary heart disease were included. A systematic search was conducted in eight English and Chinese electronic databases from inception to July 2025. Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials was used to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Meta-analyses were performed by using the Review Manager 5.4 when appropriate. A narrative summary was provided when meta-analysis was not feasible. A total of 25 studies (28 articles) involving 5608 coronary heart disease patients were included. The interventions were categorised into two types: those using behavioural change techniques alone (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;17) or those combining motivational strategies and behavioural change techniques (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;8). Nineteen included studies provided sufficient information for meta-analyses, with narrative summaries provided for the remaining studies. Meta-analyses showed that interventions combing motivational strategies and behavioural change techniques (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;2, SMD 0.34, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.24, 0.45, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;9&#xa0;%) and those using behavioural change techniques alone (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;4, SMD 0.30, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.12, 0.47, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xa0;%) both significantly increased the total physical activity time. Both types of interventions demonstrated significant improvement in the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;12, SMD 0.23, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.12, 0.35, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0&#xa0;%). However, no significant improvement in sedentary behaviours (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) was found in the meta-analysis. The review suggests that interventions that adopt both motivational strategies and behavioural change techniques could increase the time spent in total physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Further studies on developing and examining the effects of interventions aimed at improving movement behaviours are warranted for the coronary heart disease population. PROSPERO CRD42024500076.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training (RT) on sleep quality, mental health, cognitive function, and functional capacity among older women with both good and poor subjective sleep quality. A total of 160 older women (69.2&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;5.7 years) were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions: the RT group and the control group (CG). Each group was further divided based on their initial subjective sleep quality ratings into Poor Sleep RT, Good Sleep RT, Poor Sleep CG, and Good Sleep CG. The supervised RT program, which lasted 12 weeks in the training groups, included eight exercises performed with 8-12 repetitions and progressive loading. Sleep quality and mental health were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Cognitive functions were measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test A and B, Verbal Fluency Test, and Stroop Test. Functional capacity was evaluated using the 6-min walk test, the 4-m usual walking speed test, the walking agility test, and the 30-s chair stand test. Interaction effects were observed in specific mental health outcomes and sleep quality (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). In the Poor Sleep RT group, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores decreased from 7.26&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.89 to 4.61&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.83 (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), with post-training values lower than those in both control groups.

Similarly, depressive symptoms (assessed by the PHQ-9) decreased post-training in both RT groups, showing lower values than the controls. Additionally, similar interaction effects provoked by RT were revealed for cognitive performance (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) and functional capacity (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Our results suggest that a 12-week RT program can improve subjective sleep quality, mental health, cognitive function, and functional capacity, regardless of initial sleep quality levels.",

    "title": "Sex and gender differences in caregiver burden among family caregivers of persons with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis examined sex and gender differences in caregiver burden among family caregivers of persons with dementia and explored variations by region and country income level. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in four databases (CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO), including studies up to December 2024. Forty-seven studies representing 24 countries were included in the systematic review, with 39 studies (41 effect sizes) included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled effect sizes (Cohen's d), and subgroup analyses were performed based on region and national income level. Across the 47 studies, 14,919 family caregivers participated, of whom 70 % were women. Most family caregivers were either spouses (44 %) or adult children (43 %). Care recipients were predominantly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Female caregivers reported significantly greater burden than males (Cohen's d= 0.21, 95 % CI: 0.13-0.29, p&lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed higher burden in Asian countries (d= 0.27) compared to Western countries (d= 0.19), though the difference was not statistically significant. High-income countries showed greater disparities (d= 0.21) than middle-income countries (d= 0.16), with no significant difference. High heterogeneity was observed among Western and high-income countries. Female family caregivers experience a higher burden than male caregivers across regions and economic settings. Although regional and income-level subgroup differences were not statistically significant, findings underscore the role of cultural and structural contexts in shaping caregiver burden. Gender-sensitive, context specific interventions are essential to address these disparities.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) combined with moderate alcohol consumption on mental well-being and mood in healthy young adults. Seventy-four participants from Spain (18-40 years; 46&#xa0;% female) were assigned to a control group or a HIIT group (2 days/week) with either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages (330&#xa0;ml of the respective beverage at lunch and 330&#xa0;ml at dinner for men, and 330&#xa0;ml at dinner for women, from Monday to Friday). The HIIT-Alcohol group consumed alcoholic beer or vodka-sparkling water (5.4&#xa0;%), while the HIIT-NonAlcohol group consumed non-alcoholic beer or sparkling water. A control group maintained an active lifestyle without regular training. Psychosocial parameters and mood were assessed at baseline and after 10 weeks using questionnaires, with bi-weekly assessments of stress, emotional intelligence, and mood. Both intervention groups showed improvements in depression, affective and mood state parameters, and emotional intelligence after a 10-week HIIT program (all p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05), independently of alcohol consumption, with no statistical differences between groups or sex influence (all p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.05). No significant improvements were noted in any of the variables in the Non-Training group. We provide evidence that a 10-week HIIT program elicits improvements in psychosocial parameters and mood adaptations in healthy young adults. Moreover, no significant impairments were noted due to alcohol intake in moderate amounts.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary research has highlighted the important role of affect, affect-related cognitions (e.g., remembered/anticipated affect), and enjoyment for exercise adherence. The peak-and-end rule postulates that the affective peaks and end encountered during an episode of experience influence how pleasant/unpleasant the episode is remembered. This study aimed to explore the influence of these specific moments on affect-related cognitions, enjoyment, and exercise frequency. This study was based on a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. Forty-six non-regular exercisers (M<sub>age</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;32.00 years; SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.62; 43.5&#xa0;% male) were randomly allocated. Both groups participated in three exercise sessions structured according to the Frequency-Intensity-Time-Type (FITT) principle. However, in the experimental group, participants were encouraged to regulate their intensity using strategies theorized to promote pleasure. The Feeling Scale (FS) was used to measure affective responses. Linear regression analyses were applied to test the ability of FS peaks and FS end, in addition to the FS mean, FS slope, and FS start to predict remembered affect, next-session anticipated affect, enjoyment, and post-intervention exercise frequency (first week and the average of 8-week follow-up). All FS variables, except for the FS slope, meaningfully predicted remembered/anticipated affect and enjoyment (10&#xa0;%-47&#xa0;% explained variance). Regarding post-intervention exercise frequency, both affect-related cognitions and enjoyment exhibited significant predictive power (7&#xa0;%-20&#xa0;% explained variance). The results corroborate the relevance of the peak and end rule and the value of affect-related cognitions and enjoyment for exercise adherence. Future studies should further test these concepts in longer interventions and follow-up periods.",

    "abstract": "Prehabilitation has shown efficacy in improving postoperative outcomes in abdominal surgery. Data on cardiac surgery are controversial. To determine if a multimodal prehabilitation programme reduces the rate of postoperative complications after elective cardiac surgery. Randomised controlled trial. Single-centre study in a tertiary hospital with inclusion period spanned from March 2018 to June 2021. One hundred and fifty-one patients, with an expected waiting time before surgery of 6&#x200a;weeks or more, completed the study. Excluded were those with functional, anatomical or cognitive impairment; cardiac instability; dynamic left ventricle outflow tract obstruction or proven exercise-induced arrhythmias. Four to six weeks of a multimodal prehabilitation programme, including exercise training, psychological and nutritional support. Incidence of postoperative complications. No differences were found in the rate of postoperative complications (80% in both groups, P &#x200a;=&#x200a;0.968), most of which were mild, with a Comprehensive Complication Index of 21 and more than 70% with Clavien-Dindo grade I or II.

    "abstract": "Physical exercise offers many health benefits, with substantial evidence supporting its positive impact on affective symptoms. An intriguing yet underexplored mechanism associated with this effect is the enhancement of interoception-the ability to perceive internal bodily sensations. We investigated the effects of long-term aerobic exercise on interoceptive accuracy (IAcc), interoceptive confidence (ICon) and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Physically inactive young adult participants were randomly assigned to either an Experimental (n = 32) or a passive Control group (n = 30). The Experimental group completed a 12-week cycling ergometer program, with the first 6 weeks consisting of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) followed by 6 weeks of moderate to high-intensity interval training (MIIT). IAcc and ICon was assessed through a heartbeat counting task, while symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of intervention. The results showed a significant improvement in IAcc, ICon and affective symptoms in the Experimental group after 6 weeks of MICT compared to baseline. However, the transition to MIIT did not produce further gains. No beneficial changes in IAcc, ICon or affective symptoms were observed in the passive Control group throughout the intervention. The study highlights exercise's potential to improve interoception in physically inactive young adults and to enhance emotional well-being by improving affective symptoms. Given the increasing physical inactivity among healthy individuals, our findings may contribute to preventing the adverse consequences of such a lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Overnutrition, defined as overweight and obesity, is a growing concern among older adults, increasing the risk of comorbidity, disabilities, and mortality. However, the optimal management of overnutrition in this population remains unclear. The aim is to develop and assess the effectiveness of a nutritional and physical activity intervention on muscle function and quality of life (QoL) among older adults with overnutrition in nursing homes (NHs). A 12-mo cluster randomized participatory trial was conducted in six Danish NHs. The NHs were assigned following a 1:1 allocation ratio for control and intervention. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model, intervention components were participatorily developed over the first 6 mo and implemented over the remaining 6 mo. Muscle strength was measured via hand grip strength and a 30-second chair stand test. The Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit assessed the care-related QoL. Mixed-effects models analyses were used to evaluate the intervention effects. Ninety-three residents participated; 59% were overnourished. The intervention included daily/weekly physical and social activities, protein-rich bread, \"Snack-on-Wheels,\" systematic weighing, nutritional tasks for trained staff, and communication standards. Hand grip strength improved among men across weight statuses in the intervention group compared to the control group (P = 0.039). QoL was maintained in the overweight group, whereas it improved in the normal weight group (P = 0.019), with significant gains in social participation for both subgroups (P = 0.026). Participatorily developed nutrition and physical activity interventions can improve all NH residents' physical function and well-being.",

Group 2 reported a higher caloric intake, compared to Groups 1 and 3 (P = 0.020). Postintervention, all groups demonstrated reductions in weight, BMI, and WC (P &lt; 0.05). Only Groups 1 and 2 achieved significant reductions in VAT (P &lt; 0.05), while no significant changes were observed in SAT (P &gt; 0.05). VAT reduction varied from 0.6% (control group) to 9.0% (Group 2), although differences between groups were not significant (P = 0.202). Serum glucose and lipid levels were similar across all groups (T0, P &gt; 0.05), and no intervention changed these metabolic parameters (P &gt; 0.05). After three months, we observed minimal differences in weight loss across the different nutritional strategies, suggesting that nutritional counseling and/or specific dietary protocols can effectively promote weight reduction.",

    "abstract": "Gay community stress has been linked to social anxiety among sexual minority men; however, the moderating role of identity-related processes (e.g., sexual identity centrality) has yet to be examined in this association. The present study investigated the association between gay community stress and two measures of social anxiety (i.e., self-reported social anxiety symptoms and interviewer-based diagnostic assessment of social anxiety disorder), as well as the moderating role of sexual identity centrality. Data come from the baseline assessment of a randomized controlled trial testing an LGBTQ-affirmative cognitive behavioral therapy intervention with 251 sexual minority men between the ages of 18-35. Results showed that gay community stress was significantly associated with social anxiety symptoms and social anxiety disorder diagnosis. Sexual identity centrality moderated these associations, such that the link between gay community stress and both social anxiety assessments was stronger among participants with higher levels of sexual identity centrality. These significant findings remained even after accounting for sexual orientation-based discrimination and general life stress. Future research can investigate how the interaction between gay community stress, sexual identity centrality, and social anxiety develops over time to inform interventions aimed at mitigating social distress among sexual minority men.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to to assess the effect of pre-exercise caffeine intake (CAF) on fatigue and recovery in basketball. Using a randomized crossover design, 14 amateur male players completed two basketball-specific training sessions (in-season phase, February-March 2024), preceded by CAF (3 mg/kg body weight) or placebo ingestion (CON). Countermovement jump height, 10- and 20-m sprint times, heart rate variability (Ln-rMSSD), static and dynamic muscle soreness, and perceived fatigue were recorded at pre-training, post-training and 24 h post-training to evaluate the effectiveness of caffeine supplementation. The results showed no significant differences between CAF and CON at corresponding time points for any variable (P &gt; 0.05). Regarding the effect of time, the main findings indicate that countermovement jump (average percentage change [%&#x2206;] = -7% to -10%) and Ln-rMSSD (%&#x2206; = -33% to -54%) decreased at post-training compared with all other time points (P &lt; 0.001, effect size = 1.41-1.98), while 10-m sprint times deteriorated from pre-to-post-training (P = 0.029, effect size = 0.69, %&#x2206; = -2%). Similarly, muscle soreness (%&#x2206; = +171%) and perceived fatigue (%&#x2206; = +156%) increased from pre-to-post-training in both interventions (P &#x2264; 0.006, r = 0.57-0.61), with static soreness in CON (%&#x2206; = +127%) and dynamic soreness in CAF (%&#x2206; = +139%) remaining higher than pre-training levels up to 24 h post-training (P &#x2264; 0.010, r = 0.53-0.58). These findings suggest that pre-exercise caffeine intake did not significantly affect markers of fatigue in amateur basketball players, either acutely or 24 h post-training.",

    "abstract": "Sleep impairment following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is common and may decrease patient satisfaction and early recovery. Standardized postoperative recommendations for sleep disturbance (SD) have not been established. We aimed to assess whether melatonin use improves sleep quality and quantity in the acute period following THA. Patients undergoing primary, elective THA between July 2021 and March 2024 were prospectively enrolled and randomized to receive either 5 mg of melatonin or a placebo nightly for 14 days postoperatively. Participants recorded nightly pain scores on the visual analog scale, the number of hours slept, and the number of nighttime awakenings in a sleep diary. SD was assessed preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 14 using the patient-reported outcome measurement information system SD form. Epworth Sleepiness Scores (ESS) were collected to assess sleep quality. Of the 139 patients who completed the study protocol, there were 64 patients in the placebo group and 75 patients in the melatonin group. Both groups demonstrated comparable postoperative ESS (melatonin: 6.0 &#xb1; 4.0; placebo: 6.8 &#xb1; 4.5, P = 0.35). Melatonin patients experienced significantly more hours slept on POD two (6.5 &#xb1; 1.7; 5.7 &#xb1; 2.4, P = 0.017) and averaged over POD one to three (6.1 &#xb1; 1.6; 5.7 &#xb1; 2.0, P = 0.14), although this was not statistically significant. Fewer nighttime awakenings in the melatonin group were observed on POD 2 (2.7 &#xb1; 1.5; 3.1 &#xb1; 2.0, P = 0.28), although this was not statistically significant. The melatonin group demonstrated significantly lower postoperative patient-reported outcome measurement information system SD scores (52.5 &#xb1; 9.3; 56.3 &#xb1; 9.2, P = 0.040). Melatonin may not improve overall postoperative sleep quality following THA as measured by the ESS. Melatonin may promote sleep duration in the POD one to three period, although potential benefits wane after POD three. Melatonin is safe and can be considered for THA patients experiencing early postoperative SD. I.",

    "abstract": "Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with many health benefits; however, up to 94% of postpartum individuals do not meet PA guidelines. Understanding mediators of postpartum PA behavior change interventions is essential to increase PA participation following childbirth. The purpose of this review was to identify putative mediators of postpartum PA interventions. Six databases were searched for primary or gray literature from inception until December 2023. Intervention studies of any language were included if they contained (a) individuals &#x2264; 12 months postpartum, (b) a PA intervention, (c) a no exercise or different exercise comparator, and (d) a change in PA and putative mediator outcome that could be classified with the theoretical domains framework (TDF). Results were categorized by mediation path, mediator TDF domain, and PA outcome. Twenty-eight articles (3,328 participants) were eligible, and summary effects for Paths AB, A, B, and C were calculated from two, 19, two, and 18 unique studies, respectively. For the mediation Path AB, we found very small effects from the domains of beliefs about capabilities (<i>r</i> = .08), beliefs about consequences (<i>r</i> = .02), environmental context and resources (<i>r</i> = .01), and social influences (<i>r</i> = .08). We found a small total effect (Path C, <i>r</i> = .12) of postpartum PA interventions on PA. Future postpartum PA interventions should integrate components that increase outcomes under the domains of beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, and social influences. Further research that tests nonconscious mediators (e.g., PA habit, identity) is needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

Systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang were searched for eligible randomised controlled trials from inception to April 2024. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomised Trials 2.0. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and the meta-regression aimed to investigate potential heterogeneity and identify characteristics that may be associated with more favourable acupressure outcomes. In total, 22 randomised controlled trials involving 2113 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with various control groups, acupressure exhibited a significant beneficial effect on sleep quality in cancer patients at post-intervention (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.38, 95% CI [-1.81, -0.95], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and at 4-week follow-up (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.33, 95% CI [-0.56, -0.10], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Acupressure also showed statistically significant improvements in sleep efficiency (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77, 95% CI [0.27, 1.26], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and total sleep time (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68, 95% CI [0.15, 1.22], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010) at post-intervention. None of the characteristics significantly affected the overall effect size on sleep quality. Acupressure appears to be a promising intervention for enhancing sleep quality among cancer patients. Future studies should elucidate the long-term effects of acupressure on sleep quality, identify effective acupressure characteristics and determine which types of cancer patients benefit from this intervention. This study provides a comprehensive summary of evidence supporting the use of acupressure to enhance sleep quality in cancer patients and demonstrates its effectiveness in clinical nursing practice.

On a subsequent visit, participants performed 3 sets (65&#xa0;%-1RM) at the maximum intended velocity (quantified via linear position transducer) until attaining 3 different predicted RIR (2, 4 and 6; in randomized order). After each set, participants reported their RPE. Velocity loss in the last repetition of the predicted RIR-2 (16&#xa0;% compared to the corresponding repetition in the repetitions-to-failure test; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and RIR-4 (10&#xa0;%; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) was significantly greater, whereas no difference was found for RIR-6 (0&#xa0;%; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.989). Participants underestimated the number of repetitions for predicted RIR-2 (-2.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.3 reps vs. actual RIR-2; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and RIR-4 (-1.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.6 reps; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003), but not for RIR-6 (0.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.8 reps; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.823). Predicted RIR-2 was associated with greater velocity loss and number of repetitions compared to predicted RIR-4 and RIR-6 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). RPE values did not significantly differ between predicted RIR-2, RIR-4 and RIR-6 (8.0&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.2, 7.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.2, and 7.3&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.3, p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.05), suggesting limited sensitivity. Our findings suggest that using predicted RIR may lack precision for accurately prescribing RE in older adults, but might be relatively useful for volume monitoring, especially when interpreted alongside RPE.

    "abstract": "Stroke incidence rises with age. A stroke can severely affect walking ability, requiring therapy. Robot-assisted walking therapy (ROB) has been advocated as one form of walking rehabilitation in stroke patients. However, its comparative efficacy remains controversial and three-group comparisons are scant. We compared the effects of ROB, walking training therapy without a robot (WTT) and standard treatment therapy (STT) on clinical and mobility outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients. Individuals (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;45, 71&#xa0;% males, age 64.4y &#xb1;6.34), who have recently experienced an ischemic stroke, were randomized to ROB, WTT or STT. Clinical and mobility outcomes were assessed before and after each intervention (3&#xa0;weeks, 5 sessions/week) and after 5&#xa0;weeks of no-intervention follow-up. Outcomes did not differ between groups at baseline (p&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.05). Modified Rankin Scale (primary outcome), improved (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) after ROB and WTT vs. STT. These improvements were retained relative to baseline (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) after follow-up. Barthel index, Berg Balance Scale, 10-m walking speed, the distance while walking with and without the robot for six minutes, and center pressure velocity in standing improved most after ROB (all p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), exceeding the changes after WTT which in turn were greater than the changes after STT (p&#xa0;&#x2264;&#xa0;0.040). Older adults shortly after an ischemic stroke can quickly learn to walk with a soft robot and retain substantial clinical and mobility improvements at follow-up.",

    "title": "Progressive aerobic exercise in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress markers in older adult Korean women with obesity.",
    "abstract": "South Korea is rapidly transitioning into a super-aged society, where women not only outnumber men, but also have longer life expectancy. However, older adult women in Korea engage in significantly less regular physical activity than their male counterparts. This study aimed to examine the physiological mechanisms through which a 16-week progressive aerobic exercise program affected chronic inflammation and oxidative stress associated with aging in older adult women with obesity. We randomly assigned 28 women aged &#x2265;70&#xa0;years with obesity to either an obesity exercise group (OEG) or an obesity control group (OCG). The OEG participated in a supervised aerobic exercise program three times per week for 16&#xa0;weeks, with intensity progressively increasing. To analyze the effects of the intervention over time and between groups, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted. Within-group comparisons across time points were performed using paired t-tests, and between-group comparisons at each time point were analyzed using independent t-tests. The OEG demonstrated a greater reduction in serum chemotactic chemokine biomarker CCL11 concentration than the OCG. The pattern was consistent across participants, suggesting that regular, progressively intensified aerobic exercise may help suppress pro-inflammatory chemokine expression, particularly that of CCL11, in older adult women with obesity. A 16-week program of progressive aerobic exercise effectively reduced systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in older adult women with obesity, while potentially enhancing antioxidant defense. CCL11 reduction may reflect anti-inflammatory adaptations and potential neuroprotective benefits. These findings support aerobic exercise as a non-pharmacological strategy to manage age-related physiological decline.",

    "abstract": "Recent preclinical studies have suggested that gut microbiota-derived secondary bile acids affect intestinal barrier function. In this exploratory analysis, we studied the effect of the Mediterranean diet on fecal bile acid levels and their role in intestinal barrier regulation. Data from women with impaired intestinal barrier function following the Mediterranean diet (intervention group, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;33) or standard diet (control group, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;35) were assessed in a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02087592). Evaluations comprised baseline (BL), month 3 (V1), and month 12 (V2). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using questionnaires, intestinal barrier function using validated biomarkers (plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and fecal zonulin), and fecal bile acids using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As described before, the intervention group showed increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet and reduced plasma LBP and fecal zonulin levels over the entire observation period (BL-V1 and BL-V2, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), whereas the control group did not. In the intervention group, the fecal levels of the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) decreased, whereas the levels of the tertiary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid increased (BL-V1 and BL-V2, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). Multivariate analyses confirmed that the Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with DCA, LCA, LBP, and zonulin levels. Mediation analyses showed that decreases in DCA and LCA mediated the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on LBP. Consistent with previous pre-clinical studies, we found that the Mediterranean diet altered fecal secondary bile acid levels and that this alteration was associated with improved intestinal barrier function.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the impact of acute exergaming on short video-related inhibitory control, and to compare its effectiveness with that of a conventional aerobic exercise (cycling ergometer). In a between-subjects design, 87 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) exergaming, (2) cycling, or (3) control. Each participant engaged in 30 min of the assigned activity. Following the intervention, participants completed a Go/No-go task to measure their short video-related inhibitory control. Behavioral outcomes and event-related potential components were measured. The results showed that both acute exergaming and cycling enhanced the accuracy and P3 amplitudes for non-video app image stimuli (NVA). Acute exergaming specifically enhanced accuracy and P3 amplitudes for short-video app image stimuli (SVA), a pattern not observed following cycling. Latency analyses showed that exergaming and cycling resulted in shorter P3 latency than the control condition. In conclusion, while both interventions improved general inhibitory control, exergaming uniquely demonstrated enhancements in short video-related inhibitory control. These findings underscore the potential advantage of exergaming within its own contexts that benefit from higher cognitive, motivational, and multisensory engagement.",

    "abstract": "To identify the most effective aerobic exercise regimen and explore the dose-response relationship for improving depressive symptoms. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science, covering studies up to September 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of aerobic exercise on depressive symptoms in children and adolescents (6-19&#xa0;years) were included. Subgroup analyses were performed based on age, depression status, and exercise characteristics. Outcome measures were standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95&#xa0;% confidence intervals (CI). Eighteen RCTs with 1540 participants were included. Aerobic exercise significantly reduced depressive symptoms post-intervention (SMD: -0.37, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.59 to -0.15) and during follow-up (SMD: -0.51, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.85 to -0.18). Effects were stronger in adolescents and those with clinically diagnosed depression. Moderate-intensity exercise (4.0-5.9 METs), 30-45&#xa0;min per session, 3-4 times per week, over 6-10&#xa0;weeks was most effective. Dose-response analysis found an optimal dose of 590 METs-min/week (SMD: -0.46, 95&#xa0;% CrI: -0.78 to -0.10), with an effective range of 360-780 METs-min/week. Aerobic exercise significantly reduces depressive symptoms in adolescents, particularly in those with diagnosed depression. Moderate-intensity exercise (4.0-5.9 METs), 30-45&#xa0;min per session, 3-4 times per week, over 6-10&#xa0;weeks, is most effective. The optimal dose is 590 METs-min/week. These findings offer practical insights for designing targeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to understand the perspectives of surgeons and trainees on intraoperative surgical education, identifying perceived barriers and facilitators. Surgical training is shifting towards competency-based medical education (CBME) with the goal of graduating measurably competent surgeons. Despite this, concerns remain that trainees lack the clinical exposure to develop surgical competency. Understanding surgeon and trainee perspectives on intraoperative education can help identify current issues and provide direction for improving surgical training. A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies that assess surgeon and trainee perspectives of intraoperative education was performed. 11,287 papers were screened, and 60 met the inclusion criteria, representing the perspectives of 1592 surgeons and trainees. Three major themes emerged that emphasised (1) the importance of developing trust, (2) the key qualities of effective surgeon educators, and (3) the impact of financial incentives, medico-legal concerns and educational support in the educational environment. This review provides a framework to understand intraoperative education and identifies key facilitators and barriers for surgeons, trainees and training programs.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the strength of the relationship between alexithymia and facial expression recognition. Secondary aims were to determine if the strength of the relationship was moderated the type of stimuli (e.g., dynamic, static) used in the study, and whether studies excluded participants with mental health disorders. Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Scopus database searches were conducted on 21&#xa0;st June 2024. Studies were included if they comprised participants aged between 16 and 65&#xa0;years, included a validated measure of alexithymia, a forced choice facial expression recognition labelling task, and reported the relationship between these variables. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. Twenty-four studies were included in a random effects meta-analysis revealing a significant, medium, negative relationship between alexithymia and overall facial expression recognition ability, r = -0.24, CI [-0.29, -0.18]. Small, negative relationships were observed for recognition of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness. The type of stimuli moderated the strength of the relationship, with significant negative relationships between alexithymia and recognition of static facial expressions observed, but no significant relationship observed for dynamic stimuli. Exclusion of participants with mental health disorders did not moderate the strength of the relationship. Results indicate alexithymia is associated with a global deficit labelling static facial expressions, that does not appear to be attributable to comorbid mental health disorders. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between alexithymia and recognition of dynamic facial expressions.",

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of an aging simulation suit on empathy levels among primary care nurses during interactions with older patients. A cluster-randomized controlled trial (September-December 2023) was conducted in 14 primary care centers (Asturias, Spain). A sample of 135 nurses was randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Empathy (Jefferson Scale) was measured pre- and post-intervention. Changes were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Empathy increased in the intervention group (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.04; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043). The Cohen's d of 0.44 indicates this effect is clinically relevant. Multiple linear regression model revealed the intervention group itself had a significant effect (B&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.79; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035). Furthermore, professional experience modulated changes: increases were seen in the 5-10&#x2009;years (B&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.41; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024) and over 40&#x2009;years groups (B&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.93; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048), with a decrease in the 31-40&#x2009;years group (B&#x2009;=&#x2009;-6.50; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009). Unregulated post-graduate training also showed a significant increase (B&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.36; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.034).

However, due to neurological and neurocognitive deficits its assessment remains challenging, and needs remain unmet. We compared a novel face-to-face assessment during doctor-patient conversations with questionnaire-based screening. In this multicenter, two-arm cluster-randomized study involving 13 centers patients in the interven-tion group (IG) were screened for distress via physician-patient conversations, while the control group (CG) completed the Distress Thermometer. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients with poor emotional functioning (measured with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire) who received specialized psychosocial care (PC) within 3 months. Data were collected via patient and physician reports and medical records. Analysis employed mixed models logistic regression. In total, 763 patients were enrolled at baseline, and 506 completed the follow-up. The emotional functioning was poor in 302/506 (59.7%). The frequency of patients reporting PC utilization was comparable between groups (IG 93/168, 55.4% vs. CG 87/134, 64.9%, odds ratio (OR) =0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.40-1.11, p=0.115).

Research in primary care is not well established and is not part of routine practice. This study aims to investigate the barriers and facilitators to primary care staff conducting research. A systematic literature review was conducted in CINAHL, Medline, APA, PsycInfo, AHMED and EMBASE from inception to April 2023. Searches were for studies involving clinical or non-clinical staff working in primary care where barriers or facilitators to conducting research were examined. Twenty-one studies were included from 2000 to 2022. The QuADs quality appraisal method found that papers were of varying, often low quality. Five themes were found - research beliefs &amp; understanding, time, funding &amp; recognition, skills &amp; knowledge, administration &amp; support, ethics &amp; understanding and communication &amp; people. Staff thought research useful but optional and were impeded by time and funding. They need training and support to carry out research. Communication from the researchers before, during and after study completion would prevent problems and lead to more research participation in the future. Improved communication at all stages would serve as a facilitator to primary care staff conducting research. Clear, appropriate training for all staff would allow them to complete appropriate tasks for their roles and prevent one individual taking full responsibility. Embedding research in primary care with protected time and resources to complete it would remove barriers to taking part. Barriers and facilitators to staff conducting primary care research include time, funding and support.Clear communication between researchers and staff before, during and after studies would facilitate involvement.Research training would allow appropriate staff members to do appropriate tasks therefore embedding research into the whole primary care team.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Intensive Care Unit (ICU) databases have been publicly released to advance data driven intensive care medicine. However, these public ICU data sets are prone to changes, updates and new releases. Therefore, the goal of this review is to provide clinicians and data scientists with a state-of-the-art overview and guide for choosing the relevant ICU data sets for their respective research questions. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, PhysioNet, Arxiv, MedRxiv and BioRxiv to identify all publicly available intensive care data sets of adult patients. After data extraction of database characteristics, a qualitative synthesis of results was carried out. 882 publications were identified. After screening, 7 publicly available ICU databases were included for analysis: AmsterdamUMCdb, eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), High Time Resolution ICU Dataset (HiRID), Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV, Northwestern ICU (NWICU), Salzburg Intensive Care database (SICdb) and Zigong Fourth People's Hospital (ZFPH) database of patients with infections. A qualitative synthesis showed notable differences in number of patients, usage of organ support, admission types and frequency of measurements. Each public ICU data set differs due to differences in medical practice, information technologies and approach to legal restrictions. This systematic review provides clinicians and data scientists with an overview of available public ICU data sets and their characteristics.",

    "abstract": "This review aims to assess evidence regarding the effectiveness of family-provider communication interventions. We searched six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library). Two researchers independently extracted data and assessed bias. Data were analyzed using Stata software and Review Manager. Nineteen studies were included. Communication interventions had a moderate effect on family needs (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.43, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.81 to -0.06, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.025), small effects on 6-month psychological distress (Overall: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.14, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.34 to -0.04, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04; Anxiety: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.16, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.28 to -0.05, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004), and reduced symptom prevalence (Anxiety: RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.78, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.65-0.94, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009; Depression: RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.65-0.97, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.022; PTSD: RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.70, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.53-0.94, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.015), with a small ICU stay reduction (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.10, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.20 to -0.01, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036). Face-to-face (FTF) with print supplements had a moderate effect on family needs (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.53, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.69 to -0.36, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), small effects on 3-month anxiety (RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.59, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.44 to 0.79, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and depression incidence (RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.44 to 0.89, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009). Conversely, FTF with digital supplements yielded small effects on communication quality (SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.28, 95&#xa0;% CI: 0.05-0.52, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01), 6-month psychological distress (Overall: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.19, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.34 to -0.04, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01; Anxiety: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.22, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.34 to -0.10, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001; Depression: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.17, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.29 to -0.04, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007; PTSD: SMD&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.18, 95&#xa0;% CI: -0.34 to -0.02, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.03). Family-provider communication interventions effectivelyimprovefamily needs and communication quality,enhancelong-term psychological outcomes, andreduceICU stays. Print materials excelled in immediate information delivery andacute distress alleviation, while digital communication tools were superior for sustained communication and long-term distress management.Notably,despitenurses assumingmultifaceted communication roles, robust evidence for their intervention effectiveness remains lacking. ICU providersshould consider utilizingprint materials for immediate information delivery and digital tools forongoing psychological support. Future studies must validate nurses' communication roles and develop optimized strategies to enhance these interventionsto fully leveragenurses' professional expertise.",

    "abstract": "Excessive self-criticism has been associated with several psychiatric disorders, as well as poorer therapeutic outcomes. Compassion-based therapies are time-consuming and can be challenging because of the use of mental imagery. Virtual Reality interventions enable concrete visual representations and may be more efficient. We investigated a single-session VR intervention, based on chair dialogue exercises from schema therapy, for self-criticism and self-compassion. Furthermore, the additional effect of the novel VR technique perspective change was assessed. Undergraduate students (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;68) with high levels of self-criticism were randomized to either the intervention with or without an additional perspective change. Pre- and post-measures consisted of self-report questionnaires on self-compassion, self-criticism, negative and positive affect. Participants underwent the single-session VR intervention where they had to respond assertively towards an avatar who expressed the participant's own excessive self-criticism. The perspective change consisted of a change to third person perspective. The VR intervention significantly decreased self-criticism and negative affect and increased self-compassion for both conditions directly after the session. No additional effect was found for the perspective change. This was the first study to apply VR within a schema therapy exercise. Positive effects indicate the potential of VR schema therapy for individuals with excessive self-criticism in clinical practice. The trial was registered retrospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial ID: NCT05887141).",

Results reveal most studies are conducted in experimental settings with no evidence of nutrition literacy impact and nonsignificant or little effect sizes on eating patterns and health status improvement, particularly in real-life studies. Despite its underpinning algorithm being strongly associated with mortality risk, differences promoted by NutriScore in shopping basket nutrient composition appear limited to saturated fats and sodium with very small effect sizes; moreover, C, D, and E categories seem ineffective in changing consumers' purchases.

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis examined the association between internalising symptoms and wellbeing, and the potential role of various factors (mainly psychological strengths and resources) in accounting for variability in their association. Databases were searched on 4 September 2023 (updated 28 June 2024) for studies reporting the symptom-wellbeing association and protective factors in adult samples without cognitive impairment. Analyses were performed in Comprehensive Meta Analysis, using the random effects model. The search resulted in 223 eligible studies (k&#xa0;=&#xa0;248, effect sizes&#xa0;=&#xa0;430, N&#xa0;=&#xa0;127,587). A significant moderate negative correlation between symptoms and wellbeing (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.472, 95&#xa0;% CI[-0.491, -0.453]) was found, along with substantial heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed no strengths/resources significantly (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.05) accounted for variability in the symptom-wellbeing association. However, hope and emotion regulation ability predicted a reduced association and explained moderate amounts of variance. Age significantly influenced the association, and subgroup analyses suggested that multidimensional measures of wellbeing produced a stronger association than unidimensional. Findings showed large variation in the strength of the association, but we did not find clear support that strengths/resources buffer against the impact of symptoms on wellbeing. Nevertheless, this meta-analysis provided novel insight into the dynamic between symptoms and wellbeing and these findings will guide future research.",

    "abstract": "Immunization Information Systems (IISs) are essential public health tools, supporting the management and analysis of vaccination data to aid clinical and strategic decision-making. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review investigated global state and operational characteristics of IISs. A comprehensive search across multiple databases up to 6<sup>th</sup> of June 2023, identified 2,612 articles, with 238 included. A significant increase in IIS research was observed in recent years, with a strong preference (84.5%) for electronic immunization registers (EIRs). Notably, 36% of IISs operate at the national level, and 47.7% meet the U.S. CDC definition, 17.0% are interoperable with personal health records, and 11.7% provide direct access to vaccination data for vaccinees or their guardians. Other key features include automated reminder systems for recipients and providers (12.1%), near real-time or real-time data entry (11.0%), the inclusion of demographic and socioeconomic data (16.7%), and the capacity to document vaccine refusal or hesitancy (10.2%). IISs contribute to improving population-level surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases. Persistent limitations related to data standardization, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness evaluation must be addressed. Strengthening these aspects is crucial to fully harness the potential of IISs in various healthcare settings, where enhanced vaccination tracking and targeting are most urgently needed.",

    "title": "Enhancing cardiac rehabilitation adherence through home-based rehabilitation and behavioral nudges: The ERA nudge study design and rationale.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) continues to be under-utilized despite known benefits across the cardiovascular disease spectrum. Unfortunately, despite efforts to augment access, barriers persist in patient access to rehabilitation and ability to participate due to logistical challenges. A choice of home-based CR may present an appealing alternative that circumvents these known obstacles. Similarly, nudge reminders, or messages designed to elicit behavioral change, may improve adherence to CR. Providing a choice of home or hospital-based CR, and nudge reminders will improve adherence to CR in an urban safety net population. The Enhancing Cardiac Rehabilitation Adherence through Home-Based Rehabilitation and Behavioral Nudges (ERA-Nudge) study utilizes a 2 &#xd7; 2 factorial design to randomize eligible CR patients to usual care versus choice of home or hospital-based CR, and tailored nudge messages versus generic reminders to encourage healthy behavior. The study assesses the effectiveness of choice of CR location (ie, home versus hospital) and nudge messages in improving CR adherence. The study also uses an implementation framework to understand reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of this approach within the context of real-world care delivery in a pragmatic trial design. The enrollment was completed in May 2023, with a total of 447 patients. The ERA-Nudge trial assesses the implementation, effectiveness, and safety of choice in CR location and nudge messaging to improve CR adherence. If successful, this approach can be easily disseminated and may inform future implementations for rehabilitation and other behavioral therapies.

    "title": "Self-compassion mediates treatment effects in MDMA-assisted therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe condition often complicated by co-occurring disorders, such as major depression, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorders. A well-powered phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial has shown that MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) may be an effective treatment for severe PTSD. However, the psychological mechanisms driving the therapeutic effects of MDMA-AT remain unclear. One potential mechanism is self-compassion, which is commonly conceptualized as a balance between compassionate self-responding (CS) - encompassing self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness - and uncompassionate self-responding (UCS) - encompassing self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification.<b>Objective:</b> This secondary analysis aimed to explore whether MDMA-AT enhances aspects of self-compassion and if changes in self-compassion mediate the therapy's effectiveness in reducing PTSD severity, depressive, and alcohol and substance use symptoms.<b>Method:</b> Eighty-two adults diagnosed with severe PTSD participated in a double-blind trial comparing three sessions of either MDMA-AT or placebo combined with therapy. Measures of PTSD severity, depressive symptoms, alcohol and substance use, and self-compassion were collected at baseline and 18 weeks later.<b>Results:</b> MDMA-AT led to statistically significant improvements in both UCS and CS. Significant improvements were also observed across all six subscales of the Self-Compassion Scale, including self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification, most with large effect sizes. Changes in UCS and CS significantly and fully mediated the effects of MDMA-AT compared to placebo plus therapy in reducing PTSD severity and depressive symptoms. Findings were not significant for alcohol and substance use outcomes.<b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest that self-compassion may play a critical role in the therapeutic effects of MDMA-AT. Further research is needed to investigate the role of self-compassion in MDMA-AT to refine and develop more targeted, effective interventions for individuals with PTSD and co-occurring depression. MDMA-assisted therapy significantly improves self-compassion in individuals with severe posttraumatic stress disorder, showing large effect sizes across various aspects, including self-kindness and mindfulness.Changes in self-compassion play a key role in reducing posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, mediating the therapeutic effects of MDMA-assisted therapy.These findings highlight self-compassion as a potential target for developing more effective treatments for individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and co-occurring depression. <b>Antecedentes:</b> El trastorno de estr&#xe9;s postraum&#xe1;tico (TEPT) es una condici&#xf3;n grave que a menudo se complica por trastornos concurrentes, como la depresi&#xf3;n mayor, el trastorno por consumo de alcohol y los trastornos por consumo de sustancias. Un ensayo aleatorizado y controlado con placebo de fase 3 bien potenciado ha demostrado que la terapia asistida con MDMA (MDMA-AT) puede ser un tratamiento eficaz para el TEPT grave. Sin embargo, los mecanismos psicol&#xf3;gicos que impulsan los efectos terap&#xe9;uticos de la MDMA-AT siguen sin estar claros. Un mecanismo potencial es la autocompasi&#xf3;n, que se conceptualiza com&#xfa;nmente como un equilibrio entre la autorrespuesta compasiva (CS, por sus siglas en ingl&#xe9;s) &#x2013; que abarca la autocompasi&#xf3;n, la humanidad compartida y la atenci&#xf3;n plena &#x2013; y la autorrespuesta no compasiva (UCS, por sus siglas en ingl&#xe9;s) &#x2013; que abarca el auto-juicio, el aislamiento y la sobreidentificaci&#xf3;n-. <b>Objetivo:</b> Este an&#xe1;lisis secundario pretend&#xed;a explorar si la MDMA-AT mejora aspectos de la autocompasi&#xf3;n y si los cambios en la autocompasi&#xf3;n median en la eficacia de la terapia para reducir la gravedad del TEPT, los s&#xed;ntomas depresivos y de consumo de alcohol y sustancias. <b>M&#xe9;todo:</b> Ochenta y dos adultos diagnosticados con TEPT grave participaron en un ensayo doble ciego en el que se compararon tres sesiones de MDMA-AT o placebo combinadas con terapia. Se recogieron medidas de la gravedad del TEPT, s&#xed;ntomas depresivos, consumo de alcohol y sustancias, y autocompasi&#xf3;n al inicio y 18 semanas despu&#xe9;s. <b>Resultados:</b> MDMA-AT condujo a mejoras estad&#xed;sticamente significativas tanto en UCS como en CS. Tambi&#xe9;n se observaron mejoras significativas en las seis subescalas de la Escala de Autocompasi&#xf3;n, incluyendo la autocompasi&#xf3;n, el auto-juicio, la humanidad compartida, el aislamiento, la atenci&#xf3;n plena y la sobreidentificaci&#xf3;n, la mayor&#xed;a con grandes tama&#xf1;os de efecto. Los cambios en UCS y CS mediaron de forma significativa y completa los efectos de MDMA-AT en comparaci&#xf3;n con placebo m&#xe1;s terapia en la reducci&#xf3;n de la gravedad del TEPT y los s&#xed;ntomas depresivos. Los hallazgos no fueron significativos para los resultados de consumo de alcohol y sustancias. <b>Conclusiones:</b> Estos hallazgos sugieren que la autocompasi&#xf3;n puede desempe&#xf1;ar un papel cr&#xed;tico en los efectos terap&#xe9;uticos de la MDMA-AT. Es necesario seguir investigando el papel de la autocompasi&#xf3;n en la MDMA-AT para perfeccionar y desarrollar intervenciones m&#xe1;s espec&#xed;ficas y eficaces para las personas con TEPT y depresi&#xf3;n concurrente.",

    "abstract": "Empathy can be divided into cognitive empathy (CE) and affective empathy (AE). CE is defined as the accurate understanding and appropriate response to others' thoughts whereas AE is defined as the accurate understanding and appropriate response to others' emotions. The overall purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of empathy interventions in physicians and physicians-in-training in increasing CE and AE. Specifically, we are interested in examining whether specific teaching methods and intervention designs may contribute to greater empathy intervention effectiveness for CE and AE outcomes. Studies searched included randomized controlled trials conducted between 1971 to 2022 examining empathy interventions for medical students and physicians. Thirty-six studies, consisting of 3,833 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Data were analysed using random-effects pairwise meta-analysis. Empathy interventions have moderate effect sizes on both CE [<i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.50 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;.30, .70)] and AE [<i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.46 (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;.30, .62)]. Heterogeneity of effects was evident for both analyses. The effectiveness of interventions on AE was moderated by measurement type. Intervention effectiveness was not significantly moderated by other intervention and study characteristics for either type of empathy. There is evidence of key differences, and similarities, in how CE and AE is taught to medical students and professionals; however, the small number and high level of heterogeneity in studies makes this difficult to confirm. Research in this field will benefit from investigators standardizing teaching and research methods across studies. Empathy interventions are moderately effective at increasing cognitive and affective empathy.Affective empathy appears more sensitive to variations in training methods and measurement than cognitive empathy.Short interventions, focused on didactic teaching and observation, that avoid public rehearsal, may be important to try.Future empathy intervention studies would benefit from stronger standardization and measurement of cognitive and affective empathy.",

    "abstract": "Levels of expressed emotion (EE) in caregivers are associated with recurrence risk in individuals with mood disorders. In adolescent offspring of parents with mood disorders, we examined the longitudinal associations between parental EE, family conflict and youths' mood states during a trial of family-focused therapy (FFT). Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;62; mean 15.7&#xa0;yrs.&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.6) had current depressed mood, mood instability, and a parent with a history of depression or bipolar disorder. Families received 12 sessions of videoconference-based FFT (psychoeducation, communication, and problem-solving) over 18&#xa0;weeks, with random assignment to one of two mobile apps. Levels of EE based on five-minute speech samples were obtained from parents at pretreatment and every 9&#xa0;weeks over 27&#xa0;weeks. At each 9-week interval, independent evaluators rated youths' mood symptoms and adolescents/parents rated family conflict and mood instability. Levels of EE were stable from baseline to post-treatment in 70.4&#xa0;% of parents. Over 27&#xa0;weeks, youth in low-EE families showed greater improvements in depressive symptoms and mood lability compared to those in high-EE families. Parents who were high-EE in one study interval reported higher parent/offspring conflict in the next interval. The association between parental EE and youths' mood symptoms was partially mediated by family conflict. Findings were unaffected by type of mobile app assigned to families.

    "title": "Effectiveness of dementia literacy interventions for caregivers of people with dementia: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Dementia is a significant global health challenge, placing a considerable burden on caregivers. Dementia literacy encompasses the ability to seek, evaluate, and apply dementia-related information, influencing dementia prevention and care. Interventions aimed at improving dementia literacy among caregivers have the potential to support caregiving by enhancing knowledge, confidence, and coping strategies. However, the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing caregiver burden remains unclear. To evaluate the effectiveness of dementia literacy interventions for caregivers of people with dementia. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials of dementia literacy interventions were searched comprehensively in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to July 12, 2024. Trials included family caregivers of people with dementia. Primary outcomes were caregiver burden; secondary outcomes included knowledge, attitudes toward dementia, and self-efficacy. Two authors independently reviewed the eligible studies, evaluated their quality, and extracted relevant data. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool for randomized trials. Meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis vers. 3.0, while narrative synthesis was applied when meta-analysis was not suitable. 40 eligible studies, comprising a total of 4336 caregivers were analyzed. Interventions varied in structure, delivery modes, durations, and frequencies and included education on dementia, caregiving techniques, stress management, and communication skills. The findings revealed that dementia literacy interventions significantly reduced caregivers' burden (Hedges' g&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.446, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and improved caregivers' knowledge (Hedges' g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.806, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), attitudes toward dementia (Hedges' g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.621, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), and self-efficacy (Hedges' g&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.272, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression indicated that the different intervention characteristics influenced caregiver burden, knowledge, and attitudes toward dementia, such as session duration, intervention frequency, mode of delivery, use of technology, total intervention duration, and number of sessions. However, significant heterogeneity and risks of bias were observed across studies. This study highlights the potential of dementia literacy interventions to address caregiver challenges and improve outcomes, emphasizing the importance of structured and sustained programs tailored to caregivers' needs. Future research should focus on optimizing intervention designs, such as session length and delivery methods, to maximize their impact and ensure long-term effectiveness.

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of causal language in warning messages about alcohol and cancer risk. In an online factorial experiment conducted in 2023, 799 US adults were randomly assigned to view one of eight messages employing different combinations of causal verbs (e.g., \"causes\") and modal verbs (e.g., \"may\") to describe the alcohol-cancer relationship. Analyses compared the effects of causal language on perceptions of causal certainty, alcohol-related cancer risk, message credibility, message reactance, and alcohol consumption intentions. Causal language did not affect perceived causal certainty, perceived cancer risk, or alcohol consumption intentions, but decreased perceived message credibility and increased reactance. Modal language decreased perceived causal certainty and cancer risk, increased perceived credibility of messages containing \"causes,\" and decreased reactance to all messages. Causal language in alcohol warning messages has complex, countervailing effects: higher-certainty causal verbs do not increase risk perceptions but increase negative reactance, whereas higher-uncertainty modal verbs decrease risk perceptions but also reactance. These results suggest causal language may pose potential tradeoffs for risk communication efforts, raising the need for caution and more research to understand its effects.",

    "abstract": "Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) face barriers to effective communication. Measures to evaluate communication quality remain limited. Patient and proxy reported outcome measures (PROMs and PrROMs) are increasingly being used to evaluate care in a patient-centered manner. We sought to identify validated PROMs and PrROMs for clinician communication quality in the ICU. A systematic literature search was performed according to COSMIN guidelines. The search strategy included text words and subject headings related to communication (construct), ICU patients (population), and questionnaires or surveys (instrument). Studies were included if they focused on the development or measurement properties of a PROM or PrROM for clinician communication in the ICU, included adult patients or proxies, and were published in English after 2000. The results were imported to Covidence, a literature review citation screening tool and manager. 10258 studies were identified. After removal of duplicates, 6210 titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion. 29 full texts were assessed. Six manuscripts assessing three measures, the Family Satisfaction in the ICU (FS-ICU), Critical Care Family Satisfaction Survey (CCFSS), and the Family Inpatient Communication Survey (FICS), met criteria for inclusion. The only measure to have undergone an adequate design process, per COSMIN criteria, was the FICS. The FS-ICU and CCFSS demonstrated sufficient content validity. The FS-ICU demonstrated indeterminate content validity, insufficient structural validity, and sufficient construct validity. The FICS demonstrated sufficient structural validity, internal consistency, and construct validity. Other measurement properties were not reported. None of the identified measures met criteria for recommendation based on the COSMIN framework. Furthermore, none of the measures exclusively or comprehensively assessed communication quality. Proxy measures evaluating the quality of clinician communication in the ICU are limited. New measures or significant revision of current measures is necessary alongside developing multidimensional protocols for assessment.",

    "abstract": "One-way text messaging to re-engage people in HIV care has shown promise, but little is known about two-way messaging. We evaluated a behaviourally-informed two-way text messaging intervention to increase re-engagement in care following missed visits. We conducted an individual-level randomised controlled trial between February and March 2023 in Capricorn District, South Africa. Adults aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;18 years who had missed an ART visit by &gt;&#x2009;28 days were randomised to (1) a standard one-way text message, or (2) behaviourally-informed two-way text messages. The primary outcome was return to care within 45 days, analysed as (1) intention to treat, and (2) restricted to successful message delivery. 3,695 participants were randomised: 1,845 to the one-way message group and 1,850 to the two-way message group. 27.9% (515/1845) of participants sent a one-way message and 27.2% (503/1850) sent a two-way message returned for an ART visit within 45 days (proportion difference: -0.7%, p-value: 0.622). In an analysis restricted to participants whose text message was delivered, 28.3% (310/1094) in the one-way message group compared to 28.3% (304/1076) in the two-way message group returned to care (proportion difference: -0.09%, p-value: 0.966). 19.5% (210/1076) responded to the two-way message. The two most reported reasons for missed appointments were being out of town (41.0%) and still having medication (31.0%.). Behaviourally-informed two-way text messages did not improve return to care over one-way messages. However, they elicited reasons for disengagement. Additional research is needed on the mode, content and timing of two-way messages intended to increase return to care.Clinical Trial Number: PACTR202202748760768 &amp; DOH-27-042022-6703. 28 February 2022.",

    "abstract": "Patients with limited proficiency in the primary language who do not receive a healthcare interpreter have poorer health outcomes. Clinician preference is an important factor in determining whether a healthcare interpreter will be used; yet little is known about their experiences and preferences for working with healthcare interpreters. To review and synthesise the evidence examining nurses' experiences of working with healthcare interpreters when caring for patients with limited proficiency in the primary language. This review follows the reporting items contained within the ENTREQ statement. A systematic search of the literature was undertaken from inception to August 2024 in the databases CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Included studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for qualitative studies. Thematic synthesis was undertaken on studies meeting the inclusion criteria, including studies undertaken in acute settings. Articles were limited to English-language papers and peer-reviewed. Eighteen studies representing the experiences of 416 nurses from eight countries were included in the review. Four themes were identified: (1) working with Interpreters, (2) tensions and challenges, (3) making connections, and (4) workarounds. Nurses' experiences of working with healthcare interpreters were overwhelmingly positive; however, concerns about interpretation accuracy, unreliable technology, additional time required when working with a healthcare interpreter, and being sidelined were evident. Nurses commonly resorted to using bilingual nurse colleagues and family members when healthcare interpreters were unavailable. This review highlights the need for nurses to be allocated additional time in their patient loads when caring for patients with limited proficiency in the primary language. Healthcare policy that accommodates the use of bilingual healthcare professionals as well as the need for nurses to receive formal training on working collaboratively with healthcare interpreters is needed.

    "abstract": "Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), a 12-session, gold-standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and written exposure therapy (WET), a brief, five-session treatment, have similar treatment efficacy. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of long-term treatment outcomes of WET and CPT using clients' written narratives. Narratives from both treatments were coded with the Change and Growth Experiences Scale coding system to identify predictors of long-term PTSD symptom outcomes. Participants were 113 adults with PTSD randomly assigned to receive WET (<i>n</i> = 60) or CPT (<i>n</i> = 53). In WET, higher average levels of accommodated (balanced, healthy) beliefs predicted lower PTSD symptoms at the 60-week endpoint, as well as a decrease in symptoms over the follow-up symptom slope. In CPT, higher average negative emotions and positive view of self predicted better 60-week PTSD symptom outcomes, as did lower hopelessness, which also predicted a decrease in PTSD symptoms over the follow-up period. Even without direct cognitive change techniques, adaptive processing of traumatic experiences occurred in WET and predicted PTSD long-term symptom improvement. Both emotional engagement and cognitive change might help to sustain treatment gains in CPT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Clinical supervision is considered important in psychotherapy training, but little is known about the efficacy of specific supervision methods. We investigate two such methods (video-based vs. verbal report-based supervision) in a randomized controlled trial. Seventy-three supervisees were trained in common cognitive-behavioral therapy methods (i.e. behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring) by means of written information and a modelling video demonstrating the techniques. Supervisees had to apply the techniques in role plays with standardized patients (presenting depressive patients). Subsequently, supervisees were randomized to supervision, based on the video, or supervision based on the verbal report of the supervisees. Subsequently and after a three-month follow-up period, supervisees had to demonstrate the therapeutic techniques again. Therapist competence, therapeutic alliance, empathy, and anxiety were assessed through various different perspectives (i.e. independent raters, standardized patients, and supervisees' self-evaluation). Both supervision conditions lead to a significant improvement of therapeutic competences, therapeutic alliance, and empathy. No significant differences were found between the two supervision conditions. At three-month follow-up, training effects decreased on all perspectives except standardized patients. A training condition without supervision would be necessary to demonstrate that improvements are specific effects of the supervision conditions. Moreover, further supervision seems necessary to maintain training effects over time.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aims to study research on enrichment programs for gifted students and synthesize the effects on cognitive and affective skills reported by studies conducted between 2014-2024 years. During the screening process, the focus was on quantitative studies published between 2014 and 2024 that explored the influence of enrichment programs (ER) on cognitive and affective abilities of gifted students. Searches were carried out in Web of Science and Scopus databases for publications in English. The researchers examined publication bias by analysing data using various methods, including the funnel plot, Begg's test, Egger's test, and trim-and-fill test. Additionally, the researchers utilized Classic fail-safe N and Orwin's fail-safe N values for further analysis. Hedges's g was used to report the magnitude or strength of the standardized mean differences between groups in a study as effect size, since it provides effect size for smaller sample sizes. A total of 16 publications included in this meta-analysis, and results demonstrated that enrichment programs had a large effect on cognitive skills (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.14, 95% CI [.83, 1.45], under random-effect model), a medium effect on affective personal skills (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.51, 95% CI [.30,.73], under random-effect model), and small impact on affective social skills (g&#x2009;=&#x2009;.44, 95% CI [.23,.66], under random-effect model). This review underscores nuanced findings focusing on sub-domains of achievement, higher-order thinking, and personal and social-affective skills. The overall results implied that enrichment programs play a significant role in fulfilling both the cognitive and non-cognitive needs of gifted students.",

    "title": "Physical Activity Misinformation on Social Media: Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Social media is a prominent way in which health information is spread. The accuracy and credibility of such sources range widely, with misleading statements, misreported results of studies, and a lack of references causing health misinformation to become a growing problem. However, previous research on health misinformation related to topics including vaccines, nutrition, and cancer has excluded physical activity despite it being highly searched for and discussed online. This systematic review was designed to synthesize the existing literature focused on physical activity misinformation on social media in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Keyword searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for records published between January 2016 and May 2025. This search strategy yielded 9039 articles. Titles and abstracts were screened by independent reviewers, resulting in 168 (1.86%) articles selected for full-text review. After further review, 33 (19.6%) articles met the inclusion criteria and were used in the final synthesis. For the 33 studies selected, topics included physical rehabilitation and therapeutic exercise recommendations (n=15, 45%), general physical activity and messaging (n=6, 18%), exercising with a specific condition (n=4, 12%), women's health (n=3, 9%), weight loss (n=2, 6%), exercise testing (n=1, 3%), \"immune boosting exercise\" (n=1, 3%), and workplace sitting versus standing guidelines (n=1, 3%). The social media platforms YouTube (n=13, 39%), TikTok (n=7, 21%), Facebook (n=2, 6%), Instagram (n=1, 3%), and Pinterest (n=1, 3%) were studied, whereas other articles (n=9, 27%) analyzed content that had not explicitly been posted to social media but could be shared widely online. In total, 4 (12%) studies reported research that proactively engaged participants, and the remaining 29 (88%) studies analyzed readily available online content, including social media, news articles, websites, and blogs. Furthermore, 27 (82%) studies reported at least 1 measure of misinformation prevalence, whereas 21 (64%) reported a metric of reach, and 6 (18%) studies reported a measure of misinformation spread. Our findings indicate that research on social media physical activity misinformation spans a diverse array of physical activity topics, with YouTube being the most studied platform due to its widespread use and ease of content evaluation. This review also highlights the prevalence of low-quality information across various platforms and a lack of longitudinal investigations. Our review underscores the need for multifaceted research approaches and suggests several strategies to combat misinformation, including improved messaging, high-quality information dissemination by institutions, detailed debunking efforts, and raising awareness about misinformation. Future research should focus on understanding the spread of physical activity misinformation across platforms and its impact, especially on vulnerable populations.

    "abstract": "Social interactions are fundamental to human cognition, with the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) playing a key role in integrating motor coordination and social inference. While transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a promising technique for modulating cortical excitability in real time, its effect on dynamic social processes remains largely unexplored. This study applied high-definition tRNS (HD-tRNS) over the rTPJ during an interactive task to modulate motor coordination and social inference. Eighty neurotypical adults (49 female) were equally distributed across two experiments: Experiment 1, a block design with randomized active and sham stimulation blocks; or Experiment 2, a trial-by-trial design with intermixed stimulation protocols. Participants performed a coordination task with a covert virtual partner programmed to behave cooperatively or competitively. Kinematic data and self-reported attributions of humanness and cooperativeness were analyzed. The results showed that HD-tRNS over the rTPJ did not affect motor coordination or overall task performance in either experiment. However, in Experiment 1, active stimulation progressively reduced attributed humanness and cooperativeness toward the competitive virtual partner, suggesting enhanced detection of antagonistic intent. This gradual modulation of social inference was absent in Experiment 2, where frequent protocol switching likely disrupted the buildup of stimulation effects. Together, these findings highlight the rTPJ's causal role in self-other distinction, underscore the importance of stimulation protocol design in shaping social cognition, and support the exploration of targeted neuromodulation in clinical and developmental populations with atypical social cognition.",

    "abstract": "Intimate relationships can enhance quality of life and reduce the risk of psychological disorders. Self-disclosure, a fundamental component of intimacy, occurs only when vulnerability is met with acceptance rather than rejection. However, shame disrupts this process by inhibiting vulnerability and promoting defensive strategies, thereby undermining intimacy and relational security. This study aimed to address shame within an Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy framework to enhance intimacy. A randomized controlled design was employed. Twenty-six married couples were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The Experience of Shame Scale and the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships were used as assessment tools. Compared with the control, EFCT significantly increased intimacy and reduced shame in the experimental group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Shame may disrupt both intimacy and the therapeutic relationship and should be addressed during treatment. The discussion outlines possible mechanisms of change.

Eighteen studies were included, from which four key attributes of life skills were identified: decision-making, effective communication, stress management, and problem solving. These skills contribute to reducing risky behaviours, improving resilience, and strengthening overall well-being. Despite the limited evidence linking life skills that promote adolescent school health these can be defined as a set of essential psychosocial competencies that enable adolescents to effectively cope with health-related challenges in school and social environments. The theoretical framework for understanding life skills provided in this study can be used to develop specific educational programs and interventions for adolescents.",

    "abstract": "YouTube has become a major source of health information, with 2.5 billion monthly users. Despite efforts taken to promote reliable sources, misinformation remains prevalent, particularly regarding medical cannabis. This study aims to evaluate the quality and reliability of medical cannabis information on YouTube and to examine the relationship between video popularity and content quality. A systematic review of YouTube videos on medical cannabis was conducted. Search terms were selected based on Google Trends, and 800 videos were retrieved on July 8, 2024. After applying exclusion criteria, 516 videos were analyzed. Videos were categorized by content creators: (1) nonmedical educational channels, (2) medical education channels, and (3) independent users. Two independent reviewers (SK and SE) assessed content quality using the DISCERN grade and the Health on the Net (HON) code. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient. Of the 516 videos analyzed, 48.5% (n=251) were from the United States, and 17.2% (n=89) from the United Kingdom. Only 12.2% (n=63) were produced by medical education channels, while 84.3% (n=435) were by independent users. The total views reached 119 million, with nonmedical educational channels having the highest median views with 274,957 (IQR 2161-546,887) and medical education channels having the lowest median views at 5721 (IQR 2263-20,792.50). The mean DISCERN and HON code scores for all videos were 34.63 (SD 9.49) and 3.93 (SD 1.20), respectively. Nonmedical educational creators had the highest DISCERN score (mean 47.78, SD 10.40) and independent users had the lowest score (mean 33.5, SD 8.50; P&lt;.001). Similarly, nonmedical educational creators had the highest HON code score (mean 5.33, SD 1.22), while independent users had the lowest (mean 3.78, SD 1.10; P=.007). Weak positive correlations were found between video views and DISCERN scores (r=0.34, P&lt;.001) and likes and DISCERN scores (r=0.30, P&lt;.001). YouTube is a key source of information on medical cannabis, but the credibility of videos varies widely. Independent users attract the highest viewers but have reduced reliability according to the DISCERN and HON scores. Educational channels, despite increased reliability received the least engagement. The weak correlation between views and content quality emphasizes the need for content moderation to ensure that the most reliable and accurate information on health issues is widely disseminated. Future research should identify strategies to promote verified sources of information and limit misinformation.",

A randomized controlled experimental design was employed. Twenty-five children with moderate autism were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received the FMS intervention, while the control group continued with their regular daily routine without intervention. The intervention was conducted over 18 weeks, with sessions held four times per week, each lasting 45&#xa0;min at a moderate intensity. Executive function and social interaction abilities were assessed in both groups before and after the intervention. Social interaction abilities, as measured by the SRS-2 scores and its sub-dimensions, showed significant improvement (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). In terms of executive function, significant improvements were observed in the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) scale scores, specifically in inhibition, shifting (cognitive flexibility), emotional control, and working memory (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). However, there were no significant improvements in initiation, planning, organization, or monitoring functions (P&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). The FMS intervention led to improvements in both social interaction abilities and executive function in children with autism spectrum disorder. However, the improvement in executive function was selective, with certain sub-dimensions showing significant gains while others did not. This study underscores the value of cross-modal interventions that bridge motor skill development and socioemotional learning, providing a foundation for future hybrid paradigms integrating FMS and dance movement therapy (DMT)principles. The study protocol, based on a true experimental design, was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number ChiCTR2400087989) on August 8, 2024.",

    "title": "Training in communication skills for healthcare providers in chronic care: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Communication skills training (CST) is essential for healthcare providers in chronic care, enabling patient-centered, empathetic, and effective interactions. This systematic review sought to identify evidence on the effectiveness, content, and teaching methods of CST programs for providers in chronic care. It aimed to identify universal principles and adaptable strategies that help improve communication skills across diverse chronic conditions. Five databases (Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to August 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies evaluating the impact of CST programs on healthcare providers in chronic care were included. Study selection was carried out independently by two authors, with discrepancies resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer when needed. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Fifty-five studies (15 RCTs, 40 quasi-experimental) were included. Few interventions were developed with patient input (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4). Most interventions incorporated role-play with feedback (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46), didactics (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45), and group work (reflection and discussion) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37), often used in combination. Common training foci included basic communication skills (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22), breaking bad news (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19), empathy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17), and advance care planning (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14). Few interventions used booster training such as coaching, telephone, or email support (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) or online/virtual modules (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8). Oncotalk and its adaptations were prevalent. CST programs demonstrated significant improvements in communication outcomes. Communication behaviors significantly improved in most studies (93%, 37/40), with similar improvements in communication self-efficacy and confidence (96%, 26/27), largely sustained at follow-ups. Positive shifts in attitudes and beliefs toward communication were also observed in most studies (80%, 8/10). CST programs consistently improve providers' communication skills, self-efficacy, and attitudes. Their adaptability across chronic care contexts underscores their potential for broad implementation. However, standardized approaches and innovative delivery methods are needed to enhance scalability and long-term impact.",

    "abstract": "To undertake a comprehensive systematic review of currently available instruments designed to assess health information-seeking behaviors among cancer patients, appraising their psychometric properties and methodological rigor to identify the most robust instrument for clinical application. A systematic review based on COSMIN methodology. Nine electronic databases CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and APA PsycINFO were systematically searched from inception until February 2025. Employing a rigorously validated search methodology developed by Terwee, we systematically interrogated nine multinational databases spanning Chinese and English publications from inception through February 20, 2025, and targeting cancer patient populations. Following independent dual screening by researchers, the psychometric characteristics of identified instruments were systematically assessed using COSMIN quality criteria for measurement tool evaluation. From the initial 6545 studies, 16 met the eligibility criteria, involving 11 instruments for evaluating health information-seeking behaviors in cancer populations. High-quality evidence revealed insufficient content validity for the BIAS and structural validity deficiencies in the HIOS, PSM, and MBSS, all assigned a class C recommendation, while the remaining seven instruments received class B ratings. Compared to the other 10 instruments, the MHISBQ measurement attributes are relatively comprehensive and can be provisionally recommended for use. However, there is still a need for large-scale studies involving diverse cancer populations to directly or indirectly compare psychological attributes, such as the stability and responsiveness of the MHISBQ. Additionally, these studies should track changes in HISB and explore its impact on patients, so that they can help guide the delivery of accurate health information and support for cancer patients.

    "abstract": "Severe mental disorders in young people (&lt;&#x2009;25&#x2009;years) are often preceded by subtle changes in communication and thinking, detectable in speech. Speech and language markers are promising for early detection; however, no systematic review has evaluated their prospective utility in predicting mental disorders in youth. We comprehensively reviewed longitudinal studies assessing speech/language markers as predictors of major mental disorder onset or symptom progression in youth. We searched for longitudinal studies using recorded speech samples from youth or family members to predict diagnostic changes or symptom severity in major depressive disorder (MDD), psychosis, ADHD, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, OCD and eating disorders. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Our protocol was pre-registered (CRD42024579798). Of 2260 articles, 11 studies met inclusion criteria, covering MDD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), psychosis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) and ADHD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3). No eligible studies were found for OCD, substance use, bipolar or eating disorders. Both manual and computational speech analyses were used, with speech samples from parents and youth. Predictive speech/language markers included parental expressed emotion (MDD, ADHD), formal thought disorder (psychosis) and acoustic/linguistic features (psychosis, ADHD). Study quality was moderate to good (mean score: 5.45/8). Externally validated longitudinal studies on the predictive value of speech/language markers of youth-onset mental disorders are scarce, restricted to a few target disorders and do not allow for variations due to the developmental stage of the samples. Nonetheless, existing studies highlight the potential of applying Natural Language Processing methods to speech samples from both youth and parents for early identification.",

    "title": "Traditional healers can help facilitate HIV serostatus disclosure: results from a qualitative study in rural Uganda.",
    "abstract": "In Uganda, HIV-related stigma and discrimination remain major barriers to HIV care engagement and serostatus disclosure. While serostatus disclosure can improve access to, engagement with and retention in HIV care, many people living with HIV (PLWH) hesitate to disclose due to fear of negative consequences. Traditional healers (THs) are trusted community members offering accessible and confidential psychosocial support. This study explores the role of THs in facilitating HIV status disclosure among PLWH disengaged from clinical care in southwestern Uganda. This qualitative sub-study was nested within a cluster-randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of THs supporting PLWH to engage with HIV care in southwestern Uganda. In-depth semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 22 healers (14 female) and 16 PLWH (10 female) from August 2023 to June 2024. Interviews explored experiences with HIV care and healer-facilitated support to engage with and remain in HIV care. Data was analysed thematically, with particular attention to serostatus disclosure practices. Four key themes emerged: (1) PLWH, who receive care from TH practices, preferred THs over healthcare workers to disclose their HIV serostatus due to perceived trust, confidentiality and personalized care; (2) HIV-related stigma and fear of domestic violence hindered disclosure within families, but disclosure to healers offered a safer alternative; (3) in some cases, THs were the first individuals to whom PLWH disclosed their status; and (4) THs actively encouraged and facilitated serostatus disclosure by PLWH to family members, offering guidance and mediating difficult conversations. These findings highlight the critical role of THs in reducing barriers to disclosure and fostering supportive networks to improve the quality of life for PLWH. THs provide a culturally sensitive and trusted avenue for HIV status disclosure in rural Uganda. Their unique position within the community allows them to address stigma, build trust and facilitate safe disclosure practices. Integrating healers into HIV care through training and collaboration with formal healthcare systems could enhance linkage, adherence, retention and overall care outcomes for PLWH. Future research should explore scalable models to leverage the positive influence and potential of THs to improve HIV care delivery.",

    "abstract": "Studies revealed that teachers frequently experience stress and a decline in job satisfaction. This meta-analysis examined the association between teacher well-being measures and self-compassion, as well as the impact of mindfulness interventions on these traits. The study synthesises data from 19 studies, encompassing a total of 4420 teachers. It reveals a significant positive correlation between teacher well-being and self-compassion. Specifically, self-compassion inversely correlates with stress levels (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.49) and positively correlates with job satisfaction (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32). Furthermore, mindfulness interventions have been shown to substantially enhance both self-compassion (Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.77) and mindfulness (Cohen's d&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78) among teachers. These findings suggest that mindfulness interventions can effectively increase self-compassion, thereby improving teacher well-being. The positive association between self-compassion and teacher well-being underscores the potential benefits of targeted interventions to enhance these traits. However, further high-quality research is necessary to optimise interventions aimed at augmenting teacher self-compassion. This is crucial for fostering greater teacher well-being and effectiveness in educational settings.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to identify the unmet needs of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) cancer survivors in Australia, defined as individuals from non-English-speaking countries and/or those who do not speak English at home. It also examined the factors associated with the identified unmet needs, along with suggestions and recommendations to address them. Seven databases were systematically searched from their inception to November 2024. Studies focused on the unmet needs of CALD cancer survivors in Australia, regardless of the study design, were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies, and content analysis and descriptive analysis were adopted for data analysis. Six studies were included, comprising two quantitative and four qualitative studies. The quality of the included studies was moderate to high, with four included studies meeting 100&#xa0;% of the criteria. The most reported unmet needs among CALD cancer survivors were related to the health system and information, followed by psychological well-being, and patient care and support. Language barriers and cultural beliefs were the main factors associated with their unmet needs. Translated written material with culturally tailored information was the most recommended approach to address their unmet needs. CALD cancer survivors in Australia experienced unmet needs, especially culturally specific information related to cancer rehabilitation. Providing culturally tailored health resources and information in their languages or establishing multilingual platforms would effectively enhance health information provision and address unmet needs.

    "abstract": "Impaired recognition of angry, fearful, and emotionless (i.e., neutral) faces is associated with poor social functioning among individuals with schizophrenia disorder (SZ). Limited research evaluates how interventions impact these impairments. Computerized social cognition training can improve overall facial emotion recognition in SZ, but it is unclear whether it improves the aforementioned impairments. We report results from a randomized controlled trial (Trial Registration: NCT02246426) evaluating how computerized social cognition training (SCT) impacts recognition of individual emotions in SZ. Ninety-eight individuals with SZ were randomly assigned to one of two internet-based interventions: SCT or a control condition (computer games without social content) (CON). Participants completed 40 sessions of training over 8-12 weeks. Facial emotion recognition was measured with the Penn ER-40 before training, after 20 sessions, and within 8 weeks of completing 40 sessions. Accuracy and reaction times for each emotion (i.e., anger, fear, happy, neutral, and sad) were analyzed. Linear mixed model analyses and t-tests elucidated intervention effects. A significant Group x Time interaction on accuracy was found favoring the SCT group. Only the SCT group improved recognizing fearful and sad faces; the CON group did not. The SCT group had higher accuracy for neutral recognition than the CON group after training. There was no Group x Time interaction on reaction times. We conclude that, because SCT training improves fear and neutral recognition, it has the potential to improve social functioning in SZ. However, interventions need to be further refined to improve anger recognition and emotion recognition reaction times.",

Previous research on the effects of social interaction on pain thresholds in induced pain tasks indicates that even social interaction with a stranger has the potential to increase the effectiveness of VR for pain. In addition, interacting with friends or family members through media can offer social support, and conducting these interactions in immersive virtual reality may have an additive effect.

Participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;70) completed a series of induced pain tasks under four conditions: (1) connecting with a companion (friend or family member) in VR, (2) connecting with a companion via Zoom, (3) connecting with a stranger in VR, and (4) alone in VR. Social interaction increased participants' pain thresholds in VR. Participants preferred interacting with their companions in social virtual reality to all other conditions. No statistically significant difference in pain thresholds was found between interacting with a stranger or a companion in VR. These findings suggest that social interaction, especially in VR, can enhance pain thresholds, with a preference for interacting with companions and demonstrate the potential for social VR to improve pain management.",

    "abstract": "Communication between patients and staff is a crucial component of safe and effective healthcare. As people age, they have more consultations and these become more complex. As such, older people may be more likely to experience gaps and breakdowns in communication. To develop a better understanding of older people's communication in interactions with primary care staff and the barriers to and enablers of this. Four databases were searched. Search terms covered the sample (older people), domain (verbal communication in healthcare interactions), context (primary care) and research type (qualitative research). A meta-ethnographic approach was followed by one researcher, with input from the wider team. Twelve studies were included. Details of the designs, participants, methods and results were extracted. Data were synthesised through reciprocal translation, and a line of argument was developed. Barriers to communication were found in relation to raising and addressing concerns. Barriers arose from patient perceptions of their role, the nature of their relationship with staff, patient and staff perceptions of responsibility and reluctance to broach a topic, individual factors such as memory, how staff respond when concerns are raised and the degree of patient involvement in consultations. Potential enablers of communication were preparation and support from family or peers. Synthesising the existing qualitative literature on older people's communication in healthcare interactions enabled the identification of barriers and enablers that can be used to inform the development of an intervention to improve communication with primary care staff. By identifying healthcare communication as the most important topic for the patient safety of older people with multiple long-term conditions in primary care and setting the scope of the review, patients and the public were involved in the design of the study. Four public contributors (older people with multiple long-term conditions and carers of older people with multiple long-term conditions) attended regular meetings, provided their reflections on the study findings and supported the interpretation of the data.",

Eleven studies assessed effectiveness, with most reporting improvements in glycemic control (e.g., HbA1c reductions of 0.3&#xa0;% to 1.0&#xa0;%), medication adherence, health behaviours (e.g., diet, physical activity), or mental health outcomes (e.g, anxiety). Thirteen studies examined acceptability and found that most users had positive emotional and motivational responses, though some expressed dissatisfaction with repetitive or impersonal interactions. Only four studies addressed safety, and while adverse events were rare, mechanisms such as clinical escalation protocols were inconsistently applied. Most studies were rated as weak in methodological quality, with small samples and limited use of control groups. In conclusion, CAs show promise as scalable, patient-centered tools for diabetes care. However, rigorous research is needed to better understand their clinical impact, safety, and suitability for diverse patient populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecruitment is a necessary, yet challenging component to clinical trial implementation. Using intentional strategies to meet enrollment goals is important to ensure the recruited sample adequately reflects the intended study population. Outreach via electronic health record (EHR) patient portals is a promising strategy. While identifying potentially eligible individuals in the EHR is largely accepted as effective, little is known about the effectiveness of outreach via EHR compared to outreach via traditional electronic mail (email) communication given equivalent population identification strategies.MethodsThis study was conducted using recruitment data from one of four study locations participating in the LEAP study, a multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studying the long-term use of phentermine on weight loss and blood pressure. Between May 2023 and February 2024, 17,989 potentially trial-eligible participants identified using EHR data were randomized to either portal or email recruitment communications. Outreach success was measured at six milestones between starting the self-screener and study randomization. Recruitment rates overall and by demographic subpopulation are reported at each milestone as a percent of total invited and as a percent of previous milestone completers. Multivariate analysis considers the moderating effect of demographics on the relative impact of communication type.ResultsOverall, 6.6% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1191) completed the self-screener and 0.5% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;85) were randomized into the LEAP trial. Individuals randomized to patient portal communication were more likely to start the self-screener (Odds Ratio [OR]=&#x2009;2.4 [2.12, 2.73], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) and complete the subsequent four steps, however there was no significant difference in the percent ultimately randomized into the study (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.43 [0.93, 2.21], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.10). Moreover, when controlling for completion of the previous step, all subsequent milestone differences were no longer significant. Gender was the only significant moderating factor of all available participant characteristics, with women 2.92 ([2.48, 3.43], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and men 1.72 ([1.41, 2.12], p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) times more likely to respond to portal messages than email communications.ConclusionsInitial activation in study activities was higher in the patient portal group. Although this impact sustained itself across all but the final study milestone and resulted in absolute larger counts among those randomized to portal messages, there is no evidence that this choice will improve representation in biomedical research or the final study randomization rate overall. Therefore, these findings suggest using the portal strategy may lead to more effort without yield on interim steps by both the research team and the potential participants compared to email. Ultimately, the research team's approach may depend on organizational context and study topic, as some topics do not lend themselves to the less secure nature of email communications.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis, although curable, presents challenges related to treatment adherence, which compromises treatment effectiveness. Individual, social and structural barriers interfere with patients' ability to properly follow the therapeutic regimen, thereby impacting treatment outcomes. Given the limitations of the conventional healthcare model, which relies primarily on in-person consultations and standard treatment protocols without additional adherence support technologies, new approaches have been explored to improve patient outcomes. This study seeks to identify effective communication approaches in this context. To identify the most effective communication strategies to optimise treatment adherence and improve therapeutic success in patients diagnosed with tuberculosis. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted. We included studies available in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE and SCOPUS databases, with publication dates between January 2005 and December 2024. The primary outcomes were adherence to and success in tuberculosis treatment. This systematic review included 17 studies on tuberculosis treatment adherence. Of these, 12 were included in the meta-analysis for adherence and 8 for treatment success. The most effective strategies for adherence were community education (2 studies; RR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.11-0.56) and video observed therapy (VDOT) (2 studies; RR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21-0.40). The combination of electronic devices with SMS also showed positive results (3 studies; RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.37-0.77). SMS alone (5 studies) and electronic devices alone (3 studies) were not effective. For treatment success, only the combination of electronic devices with SMS (RR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.17-0.55) and community education (RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.40-0.64) were effective. The combination of electronic devices with SMS and community education is an effective strategy for improving adherence and therapeutic success in tuberculosis treatment. Isolated interventions with SMS or electronic technologies did not show significant results. Adapting approaches to local realities is crucial for optimising outcomes.",

Medium pain was evoked at baseline and post-OBL with heat stimuli to both arms. Before OBL, a placebo ointment was applied to one arm. In the experimental groups, participants observed a model expressing hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia in reaction to the ointment. In the empathy groups, participants were instructed to empathize with the model. OBL did not alter pain intensity (F(3,176)=1.02, p=.39, &#x3b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=.02), although pain expectations changed in the expected direction (F(5.76,337.84)=5.81, p&lt;.001, &#x3b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=.09). There were no between-group differences in situational empathy (indicating a failed empathy manipulation), and the magnitude of placebo hypoalgesia, or nocebo hyperalgesia (all p's&#x2265;.19). The current study is one of only a few highlighting the limits of OBL-induced placebo and nocebo effects. It suggests that changing expectations alone may not always be sufficient to produce changes in pain perception. Potential factors explaining these findings, including attention and cognitive load, are discussed. Increasing our understanding of OBL-induced pain changes can support the development of interventions for (chronic) pain. Studying the contribution of empathic processes may be particularly relevant given their vital role in human interactions. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the results of an experimental mixed-model study on state empathy and placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia, induced by observational learning (OBL). Although expectations changed, empathy and OBL did not elicit any changes in the experience of pain. The findings highlight the limits of OBL for altering pain.",

    "title": "The Relationship between Interparental Conflict and Depressive symptoms Spanning from Childhood to Youth: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies have presented diverse perspectives and inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between interparental conflict and depressive symptoms. The current study aimed to clarify the overall strength of the association between interparental conflict and depressive symptoms and its influencing factors. By analyzing 89 retrieved studies (106 effect sizes, 64462 participants) through a random-effects mode. It was found that there was a significant positive correlation between interparental conflict and depressive symptoms, with a large effect size (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.32, 95% CI [0.30, 0.35]). Additionally, measurement tools and reporter of parental conflict, sampling year, and individualism index significantly moderated this association. Specifically, the correlation between interparental conflict measured by Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict Scale and depressive symptoms is stronger than that measured by other scales. Compared with self-reported parental conflict, parental-reported parental conflict has a weaker correlation with depressive symptoms. The more recent the sampling year, the stronger the correlation, while the higher the individualism index, the weaker the correlation. This meta-analysis indicates that interparental conflict is a significant risk factor for depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Over time, especially in countries with a lower individualism index, focusing on reducing interparental conflict could help decrease the incidence of depressive symptoms in children, adolescents and youth.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 25&#xa0;% of individuals at Ultra High Risk (UHR) transition to a full psychotic disorder. Cognitive biases are thought to play a role in this risk, and improvements in cognitive biases have been associated with better clinical outcomes. Early intervention is crucial, yet no therapeutic approach has proven superior, and treatment adherence remains a challenge. Therapeutic alliance, shown to enhance adherence and clinical outcomes, might also influence depression and cognitive biases, but its role in these domains among UHR patients remains unclear. A total of 202 UHR participants (59.4&#xa0;% females, mean age 17.4), taking part in the sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART), completed questionnaires assessing cognitive biases, attenuated psychotic symptoms, quality of life, general and social functioning, depression, and overall psychopathology at baseline, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Additionally, both patients and their corresponding therapists rated working alliance following the 6- and 12-month treatment periods. The results revealed that patient-rated therapeutic alliance significantly predicted improvements in attenuated psychotic symptoms, cognitive biases, general psychopathology, social functioning, and quality of life, with the strongest effects observed when measured 6&#xa0;months into treatment. The relationship between working alliance and decreases in attenuated psychotic symptoms, as well as between working alliance and reduction in general psychopathology, turned out to be mediated by improvements in cognitive biases. Therapist-rated working alliance did not significantly predict clinical improvements, showing only a minor association with quality of life. Strengthening the therapeutic alliance and prioritizing cognitive bias modification early in interventions for UHR patients may improve treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Couples living with low incomes in the United States experience greater relational distress relative to couples with more financial resources. Drawing from the family stress model, which argues that economic strain is a catalyst for relational distress, one approach to improve the relationships of couples with low incomes might be addressing and ameliorating families' financial difficulties. This study tested this possibility using secondary data from the Baby's First Years project, a randomized controlled trial of ongoing unconditional cash transfers to mothers. We examined the impact of receiving $333/month (relative to $20/month in a control group) on mothers' relationship quality and relationship status at 1 and 2 years postrandomization, which included the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multigroup models and path analyses were employed to investigate moderators and potential mechanisms contributing to differences across conditions. Randomization into the higher cash condition was not associated with relationship quality at Year 1 (<i>b</i> = -0.02, <i>p</i> = .792) or Year 2 (<i>b</i> = -0.02, <i>p</i> = .613). Likewise, there were no significant direct effects of cash assistance on relationship status at Year 1 (<i>OR</i> = 0.94, 95% CI [0.62, 1.42]) or Year 2 (<i>OR</i> = 0.79, 95% CI [0.52, 1.20]). There was minimal evidence that effects were significant for a subset of mothers, and there were no significant indirect effects on the relational outcomes through individual or economic factors. Results of this study indicate that additional resources are likely needed to alleviate low-income couples' financial strain and improve intimate bonds.

    "title": "Remembering to forget fear: Augmenting exposure with retrieval-induced forgetting.",
    "abstract": "This study investigated use of retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) to strengthen inhibitory memories following exposures for individuals with fear of public speaking. RIF refers to the weakening of memories following recall of related memories. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;64) with elevated public speaking fear completed 16 public speaking exposures over two visits. Following each speech, participants noted one positive, inhibitory memory (i.e., absence of unconditional stimulus of rejection) and one negative, excitatory memory (i.e., unconditional stimulus of rejection). Participants randomly assigned to the Inhibitory condition rehearsed positive memories following a procedure designed to induce forgetting of negative memories from the same speeches, whereas participants in the Control condition rehearsed a mix of positive and negative memories. After the second visit, participants recalled as many exposure memories as possible. We hypothesized that RIF would occur in both conditions and that Inhibitory condition participants induced to forget negative memories would report a greater decrease in public speaking fear. In partial support of our hypotheses, we observed evidence of RIF only in the Inhibitory condition. We found no difference in change in public speaking fear between conditions, but participants who demonstrated more RIF reported a greater decrease in public speaking fear. This is the first study to demonstrate RIF of fear-related memories. Differences in RIF between conditions suggests that fear-related memories may be more susceptible to RIF than inhibitory memories. Strategies that adapt RIF paradigms or other strategies to increase forgetting of fear-related memories should be honed in the future to augment exposure.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies suggest that direct contact from healthcare to at-risk relatives may increase genetic counselling (GC) uptake as compared to family-mediated risk disclosure, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. This study assessed whether the offer of direct letters to relatives at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or Lynch syndrome increases GC uptake compared to family-mediated communication alone. Between 2020 and 2023, probands were randomly assigned to family-mediated disclosure (control) or family-mediated disclosure plus the offer of sending direct letters to at-risk relatives (intervention). The primary outcome was GC uptake within 12 months, measured as the proportion of eligible relatives at risk contacting a Swedish cancer genetics clinic. In total, 165 families (median: 4 eligible relatives, range: 1-26) were randomised to control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;79) or intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;86). GC uptake was 67% in controls and 71% in the intervention group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.23). After adjusting for predefined variables and covariates, there was still no significant difference between groups (OR: 1.24, CI: 0.79-1.95, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.34). Distant relatives had lower uptake than first-degree relatives (OR: 0.27, CI: 0.18-0.40, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), while female relatives had higher uptake than males (OR: 2.17, CI: 1.50-3.12, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). This is the largest RCT so far investigating direct letters to relatives. GC uptake was high in both groups, and the intervention of direct letters did not show superiority over family-mediated communication alone. Direct letters to relatives may complement family-mediated disclosure in certain situations, but should not be implemented as a general procedure in cancer genetics practices.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that social rewards can buffer the stress response. However, little is known about whether different types of social rewards differ in their buffering effects on different psychological stressors. Additionally, since psychological stress usually impairs people's cognitive performance, this study also examined whether social rewards could enhance cognitive abilities after stress. This study used the Trier Social Stress Test (Experiment 1) and Yale Interpersonal Stressor (Experiment 2) to induce performance and interpersonal stress, respectively. Two randomized controlled experiments with Chinese university students (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;85 in Experiment 1, N&#x202f;=&#x202f;78 in Experiment 2) compared the buffering effects of value affirmation and emotional support on stress. Furthermore, cognitive ability-enhancing effects were assessed through mental arithmetic performance (Experiment 1) and working memory capacity (Experiment 2). Results showed: 1) only value affirmation, but not emotional support, buffered the performance stress response (lower levels of cortisol, heart rate, and reports of subjective stress) compared to the control condition. 2) while both value affirmation and emotional support buffered interpersonal stress compared to the control condition, emotional support buffered better (lower cortisol and heart rate) than value affirmation. 3) Value affirmation enhanced mental arithmetic accuracy during performance stress and working memory capacity after interpersonal stress, whereas emotional support showed no cognitive benefits. These findings suggest that value affirmation is more effective at buffering performance stress, while emotional support is more effective at buffering interpersonal stress. However, only value affirmation enhances cognitive performance in both performance and interpersonal stress.",

    "abstract": "Learning by updating expectancies for aversive events is a proposed mechanism of exposure therapy. Reward processes and positive emotions, such as relief, may be closely tied to this learning process, though this has not been explicitly studied in an exposure therapy setting. Participants were UCLA college students who completed two sessions of exposure to public speaking (16 exposures total) and three public speaking anxiety assessments (baseline, post-assessment, one-week follow-up). Additionally, participants completed rehearsal exercises after exposures and were randomized to one of two rehearsal conditions: positive rehearsal designed to enhance reward processes and positive emotions (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42), or neutral rehearsal (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42). Self-reported expectancy for the feared outcome (e.g., social rejection) and relief that the expected feared outcome did not occur were measured across exposures using both observed and computational modeling indices. Public speaking anxiety decreased from baseline to follow-up, with no differences between groups. Observed expectancy ratings decreased across exposures at a faster rate for the neutral than the positive rehearsal group, with no group differences in computational modeling of learning rate. Observed relief ratings significantly decreased across exposures for the positive group only, with no group differences in computational modeling of relief rate. Faster expectancy-based learning rate and higher expectancy-based intercept at the first exposure of two exposure sessions predicted lower public speaking anxiety at follow-up. Higher intercept of relief at the first exposure of two exposure sessions, but not relief rate, also predicted lower public speaking anxiety at follow-up. Findings support learning via expectancy updating as an important process in exposure therapy and highlight a need for further study of relief during exposure.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of narrative-based interventions in correcting health-related misinformation and to identify key message-related, sender-related, and recipient-related factors influencing their success. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in databases including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, Communication Abstracts, and Web of Science. Eligible studies included quantitative intervention studies examining the impact of narrative-based corrections on health-related misinformation. Twenty studies covering topics such as COVID-19, vaccination, tobacco use, and e-cigarette use were included. Among the 16 studies comparing narrative and nonnarrative corrections, only four showed that narratives were significantly more effective in reducing misinformation-related beliefs than other message types. Several factors influenced narrative effectiveness. Message-related factors include emotional language, social framing, and message sidedness. Sender-related factors, such as the credibility of the source and relational closeness with recipients, also affected outcomes. Recipient-related factors, including cognitive style, political ideology, and social media use motivation, moderated the intervention effects. Some studies have reported unintended backfire effects in which narratives reinforce misinformation. Narrative-based corrections show the potential for addressing health-related misinformation; however, their effectiveness remains inconsistent. The variability in narrative design, media platforms, and insufficient theoretical grounding may explain these mixed results. Future research should focus on theoretically informed narratives and systematically examine the influencing factors to optimize misinformation correction strategies. The effectiveness of narrative-based corrections on health misinformation depends on thoughtful design grounded in theoretical principles such as transportation, identification, and exemplification. Health communicators should consider narrative length, depth, and emotional content and adapt messages to different platforms (e.g., social media). Tailoring interventions to audience characteristics, such as cognitive styles and prior beliefs, can further enhance efforts to correct misinformation.",

Studies presenting summary reports based on self-reported data from patients with chronic conditions and assessing SDM or decisional conflict as it relates to SDM. We extracted data formats, utilization practices, communication characteristics, communication functions, and study outcomes to evaluate summary reports. Communication characteristics and functions were categorized using Hawkins' \"tailoring in health communication framework\" and the Online Health Information Tools (OHIT) framework, respectively. We identified four themes regarding the intent of summary reports. No studies reported using electronic health records for self-reports or summary reports. All studies (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;21) used at least one communication characteristic from Hawkins' framework, and 90&#x202f;% (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;19/21) used one or more functions from the OHIT, with variability among specific characteristics and functions.

Themes from this systematic review suggest that when summary reports were developed to enhance information exchange, or when patients and clinicians actively discussed values during consultations, SDM often improved.

    "abstract": "A policy requiring front-of-package added-sugar warning labels has the potential to improve dietary patterns in the U.S. However, because such a policy would require English labels, the labels may not be equally effective among individuals with varying English proficiency. One potential way to increase the broad efficacy of warning labels is to use a multilingual campaign to explain the labels. This study's objective was to determine whether combining an added-sugar warning label with a Spanish and English educational message reduces intention to select sugar-sweetened beverages to a greater extent than using either the label or educational message alone among Hispanic adults. This is an online RCT. A total of 2,000 U.S. Hispanic adults with varying acculturation participated between October and December 2022. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) control, (2) language-matched message about added-sugar warning labels (in English or Spanish), (3) warning label (English, yellow, icon) on sugar-sweetened beverages, and (4) message plus warning. The main outcome measure is an intention to select a sugar-sweetened beverage, measured by hypothetical sugar-sweetened beverage selection in an online shopping task, analyzed in May 2023-April 2024. In the control condition, 58% selected a sugar-sweetened beverage for themselves. In comparison, a significantly lower percentage of participants selected a sugar-sweetened beverage in the message (43%), warning label (38%), and message-plus-warning (27%) conditions (all p&lt;0.001). The message-plus-warning condition had a lower risk of sugar-sweetened beverage selection than both the message and warning conditions (all p&lt;0.001). Efficacy was larger for the message among those with lower acculturation and for the warning among those navigating the study in Spanish and certain income categories. Results were similar for the secondary outcome of selecting a sugar-sweetened beverage for one's child. Using educational messages in more than 1 language to accompany rollout of a new warning label may further improve outcomes in populations with varying levels of acculturation.

    "abstract": "This randomized controlled study aimed to investigate the effect of personalized messages tailored to distinct health behavior clusters on healthcare-seeking behavior and disease management in individuals at risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This study included individuals insured by a single health insurance association in Japan, all of whom had at least one value exceeding the recommended thresholds for physician consultation based on NCDs. We sent personalized physician visit messages tailored to five distinct health behavior clusters identified in our previous study. These messages incorporated cluster-specific motivational elements to encourage physician consultation. The control group received a standard message encouraging consultation without behavioral tailoring. We utilized medical claims data to evaluate physician visit rates within 3 months and assessed disease management improvements using the following year's health checkup data, comparing outcomes between the two groups. The final analysis included 155 participants (mean age: 48.0 years, 85.6&#x202f;% men), with 76 in the intervention group and 79 in the control group. No significant differences in physician visit rates within 3 months were observed between the two groups (intervention group: 10.6&#x202f;%, control group: 17.7&#x202f;%, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.252).

However, participants who visited a physician demonstrated notably higher improvement rates in both groups (intervention group: 75.0&#x202f;%, control group: 71.4&#x202f;%).

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of a 6-week manualized autistic-informed group-based virtual mindfulness intervention in comparison to a waitlist control. Sixty-three autistic adults from across Canada were randomly assigned to treatment or waitlist. Both groups completed surveys prior to randomization, at 7 and 15&#x2009;weeks, and the waitlist group was followed for two additional time points after receiving mindfulness. We compared outcomes at the first three time points by group using linear mixed models with a secondary analysis including outcome measures from the waitlist group after intervention. Improvements in overall distress and stress, as well as self-compassion, mindfulness, and mental wellbeing were reported in the treatment condition, maintained at follow-up. No changes were reported in the waitlist condition. Neither group reported changes in terms of autistic commnity connectedness, or interoceptive sensitivity following intervention or follow-up. This study supports the virtual delivery of autistic-informed mindfulness-based programs. Further work could explore the unique benefits of synchronous group-based virtual mindfulness in contrast to more asynchronous ways to build mindfulness skills and in-person instruction.Lay abstractSome studies have shown that learning mindfulness helps autistic people, but most of these studies were done in person. We wanted to know if learning mindfulness online in a group would help improve autistic adults' mental health. We randomly put people into two groups (a waitlist and people who got to be in the mindfulness group right away). This means people did not get to pick which group they went into. A total of 63 autistic adults were in the project. After 6&#x2009;weeks of mindfulness, the people who learned mindfulness said they felt less stressed, and they were more mindful, and had better wellbeing, and more compassion or kindness for themselves, and these changes were still there 8&#x2009;weeks later. The people who did not get to do mindfulness right away did not say they felt any different. Neither group said they felt more connected to other autistic people and neither group said they were more aware of the sensations they could feel inside their bodies. This tells us that we can teach groups of autistic people to do mindfulness online together, and it can help at least some autistic adults with their mental health. We need to do more research to find out how much mindfulness training people need, if it is better to learn in person or online, and if it is better to learn as part of a group or alone.",

    "abstract": "Body language plays a vital role in emotion perception, yet the involuntary neural mechanisms through which individuals with social anxiety process these signals remain unclear. This research investigates these mechanisms by analyzing visual components such as P3a, P1, and N190 within a three-stimulus oddball paradigm. Participants were classified into high social anxiety (HSA, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;31) and low social anxiety (LSA, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;26) groups using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). The paradigm employed custom-designed distractors depicting positive, negative, and neutral body expressions to examine the involuntary processing of these stimuli. The findings indicate that individuals with high social anxiety (HSA) showed significantly higher P3a amplitudes than those with low social anxiety (LSA), especially for positive body expressions. In contrast, negative expressions elicited the weakest amplitudes. The N190 component responded most strongly to positive expressions and least to negative ones, while the P1 component showed uniform responses across all types. HSA individuals process body expressions more intensely and are highly sensitive to them, regardless of valence. This insight can inform interventions targeting their cognitive and emotional biases.",

    "title": "The Reciprocal Relationship between School Connectedness and Adolescent Depressive Symptoms: A Meta-analytic Cross-lagged Panel Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Theorists have long assumed that school connectedness and depressive symptoms influence each other in adolescence. However, previous empirical studies on the strength and direction of this relationship have yielded inconsistent results. The present study used cross-lagged modeling to meta-analyze the available longitudinal data (27 studies with 27 effects involving 57,074 participants, mean age ranging from 11.23 to 17.4 years) on the relationship between school connectedness and depressive symptoms in adolescence, and the possible moderating effects of publication and study characteristics. With prior levels of the relevant outcomes controlled for, results showed that prior school connectedness negatively predicted subsequent depressive symptoms with &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.07, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.02], while prior depressive symptoms also negatively predicted subsequent school connectedness with &#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.14, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.08]. Moderation analyses showed that there was a moderating effect of publication year, study quality in the protective effect of school connectedness on depressive symptoms and a moderating effect of publication year, study quality, and culture in the debilitating effect of depressive symptoms on school connectedness. As the publication year became more recent, the effect of school connectedness on depressive symptoms decreased, and the effect of depressive symptoms on school connectedness decreased. As study quality increased, the effect of school connectedness on depressive symptoms decreased, and the effect of depressive symptoms on school connectedness decreased. As the individualism index increased, the effect of depressive symptoms on school connectedness increased. These findings suggest that the link between school connectedness and adolescence depressive symptoms is symmetrically reciprocal and robust, adding support to that explaining the reciprocal relationship necessitates integrating Self-Determination Theory and Social Development Theory within the framework of Developmental Contextualism Theory.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of social network-based health education on self-management, self-efficacy and HbA1c of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A convenience sample of 64 elderly T2DM patients with poor glycemic control was randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group received social network-based health education with their nominated social network member for 12 weeks, while the control group received health education alone. The scores of Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA), Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES), and HbA1c were compared between groups at the baseline and after 12 weeks by using RM-ANOVA. Sixty older adults with T2DM, 30 cases in each group, completed the study. The diet and blood glucose testing dimensions of C-SDSCA had an interaction effect on group-by-time (F were 4.700 and 4.752, respectively, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The mean diet dimension score increased by 1.55 in the intervention group, while 0.76 in the control group, and the score of blood glucose testing dimension increased by 3.5 in the intervention group, while 0.75 in the control group. No significant group-by-time differences were found in C-DSES (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.667, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05) and HbA1c (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.553, p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05).

Participants (N = 136) were recruited from a large Midwestern university and completed a postvideo survey. <b>Results:</b> Analysis of variance results showed significant effects of background type on all three credibility measures. Providers in the white background condition were consistently rated lower in expertness, competence, and ethicality compared with the clinical and home office backgrounds. <b>Conclusions:</b> Findings suggest virtual backgrounds convey meaningful professional cues. Clinical and home office settings enhanced perceptions of provider credibility, while plain backgrounds diminished them. Background choice in telemedicine influences patient trust, underscoring the need for visual professionalism guidelines in virtual care settings.",

    "abstract": "Specialized burn care education for nursing students appears to be limited globally, especially in countries such as South Korea. Storytelling, recognized for its potential to foster emotional engagement and improve memory retention, presents a promising approach to enhancing burn care competencies. This study developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a storytelling-based burn care education program (SBEP) in improving nursing students' knowledge, attitudes, performance, and self-efficacy. A mixed-methods design was employed, integrating a randomized controlled trial to assess quantitative outcomes and focus group interviews (FGIs) to gather qualitative insights. The study was conducted in a nursing college in Seoul, South Korea. Sixty junior and senior nursing students were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. FGIs were conducted with 25 students from the experimental group. The experimental group participated in an SBEP, while the control group completed an independent study with the provided materials. Quantitative data were collected using pre-and post-tests, and qualitative data were obtained from FGIs. The experimental group showed significant improvements in knowledge (w&#xa0;=&#xa0;765, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), performance (w&#xa0;=&#xa0;879, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and self-efficacy (t&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.73, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) compared to the control group. Three overarching themes emerged from FGIs: (1) Deepening understanding of burn care through stimulated thinking, (2) strengthening practical skills, and (3) enhancing the quality of learning through emotional engagement. The SBEP effectively improved nursing students' burn care competencies. By fostering emotional engagement and bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application, storytelling offers a valuable approach to addressing educational gaps and preparing future nurses for specialized, patient-centered care.",

    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Digital Communication Tools on Oral PrEP Adherence: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of digital communication tools (e.g., text message reminders) on improving daily oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence. Searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychInfo, alongside clinical trial registries, we identified randomized controlled trials from 2012 to 2024 that compared digital interventions with standard care. The primary outcome of interest was PrEP adherence. From 975 studies reviewed, ten met our criteria, encompassing interventions on text messaging (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;3), mobile applications (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;6) and mobile games (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1). One study exclusively included cisgender women in Kenya. Nine studies focused on gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM)-four of these included transgender women (TW)-based in the USA (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8) and Thailand (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1). Studies measured PrEP adherence using tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) blood levels (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8), self-report (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1), and electronic bottle pill monitoring (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1). Utilizing a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RR) for adequate PrEP adherence (TFV-DP levels &#x2265;700 fmol/punch) at 12- and 24-weeks post-intervention. Due to differences in outcome measurement and timing, eight studies were pooled for the 12-week RR and seven for the 24-week RR. Those studies involved GBM and TW. At 12 weeks (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;977), results showed a modest improvement in adherence (RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14). There were no effects at 24 weeks (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;562) (RR&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.32). These findings suggest that digital communication tools had a limited impact on improving PrEP adherence. Further research is needed to develop sustained and diverse intervention strategies to support PrEP adherence. Esta revisi&#xf3;n sistem&#xe1;tica y metan&#xe1;lisis evalu&#xf3; el efecto de las herramientas de comunicaci&#xf3;n digital (por ejemplo, recordatorios por mensajes de texto) en la mejora de la adherencia diaria a la profilaxis preexposici&#xf3;n (PrEP) oral contra el VIH. Tras buscar en PubMed, Embase, Web of Science y PsychInfo, junto con registros de ensayos cl&#xed;nicos, identificamos ensayos controlados aleatorizados realizados entre 2012 y 2024 que compararon intervenciones digitales con la atenci&#xf3;n est&#xe1;ndar. El resultado principal de inter&#xe9;s fue la adherencia a la PrEP. De los 975 estudios revisados, diez cumplieron con nuestros criterios, abarcando intervenciones mediante mensajes de texto (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3), aplicaciones m&#xf3;viles (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6) y videojuegos m&#xf3;viles (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Un estudio incluy&#xf3; exclusivamente a mujeres cisg&#xe9;nero en Kenia. Nueve estudios se centraron en hombres gais, bisexuales y otros hombres que tienen sexo con hombres (GBM, por sus siglas en ingl&#xe9;s); cuatro de estos incluyeron a mujeres transg&#xe9;nero (TW, por sus siglas en ingl&#xe9;s) y se llevaron a cabo en Estados Unidos (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) y Tailandia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Los estudios evaluaron la adherencia a la PrEP utilizando niveles de tenofovir-difosfato (TFV-DP) en sangre (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), autoinforme (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) y monitoreo electr&#xf3;nico de botellas de p&#xed;ldoras (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1). Utilizando un metan&#xe1;lisis de efectos aleatorios, estimamos las razones de riesgo (RR) agrupadas para una adherencia adecuada a la PrEP (niveles de TFV-DP&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;700 fmol/punch) a las 12 y 24 semanas despu&#xe9;s de la intervenci&#xf3;n. Debido a las diferencias en la medici&#xf3;n y el tiempo de los resultados, ocho estudios se agruparon para la RR a las 12 semanas y siete para la RR a las 24 semanas. Esos estudios involucraron a GBM y TW. A las 12 semanas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;977), los resultados mostraron una mejora modesta en la adherencia (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.08, IC del 95%: 1.02&#x2013;1.14). No se observaron efectos a las 24 semanas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;562) (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.1, IC del 95%: 0.92&#x2013;1.32).

    "abstract": "In line with the patient- and family-centered care concept, no care plan is complete without considering the voice and will of patients and their relatives. Involving families in medical rounds offers opportunities for collaboration, enhanced communication with the medical team, updates on the patient's condition, and joint decision-making. This mixed-method systematic review aimed to provide evidence on family experiences regarding participation in medical rounds-specifically benefits, barriers, and suggestions-in adult ICUs. A mixed-method systematic review was conducted. Four databases were searched. Studies published in between 2014 and 2025 were included. A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. The reported experiences were categorized into three groups: benefits, barriers, and suggestions. Family presence on rounds was associated with improved medical staff family relationship, increased family satisfaction with care, improved the mental condition of the FM and increased knowledge of the patient's condition and clinical plan. Organizational barriers as well as barriers associated with medical staff were identified. Clear policies, inviting the family to participate in the rounds and improving the communication skills among medical staff are important to improve this intervention. Family participation in ICU rounds has a positive impact on family mental health and improves perceptions of the quality of patient care. ICUs should consider integrating family participation into routine practice. Improve communication skills among staff, both within the team and with patients and their families. Educate medical staff on how to conduct rounds with families and highlight the associated benefits. Use mnemonic tools for family communication. Provide orientation tools to help families understand the rounds. Schedule rounds to enable family participation. Consider telemedicine as an alternative when in-person meetings are not feasible.",

Therefore, the study purpose was to analyze the effect of a classroom-based physical activity intervention on children's physical literacy, movement behavior and cognitive performance. Randomized control trial (with retention) and multilevel linear model analysis. The Active Learning in Physical Literacy Study was conducted in Valencia (Spain) and involved 332 fifth grade students (10-11&#x202f;years) from six primary schools (three experimental and three control). The intervention, registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (number NCT05812118), lasted 9-10&#x202f;weeks and consisted of the implementation of three physically active learning activities for at least 30 min in combination with physical education lessons each day. The outcomes of the intervention were within movement behavior: moderate to vigorous physical activity; within physical literacy: perceived physical literacy, social support for physical activity, actual and perceived motor competence; and within cognitive performance: math fluency and teachers' proxy-report of math performance. A significant interaction effect (group per time) on moderate to vigorous physical activity, actual motor competence, math fluency and teachers' proxy-report of math performance was found. No interaction effect was found in the psychosocial domain (perceived motor competence and physical literacy, and parent and peer support for physical activity). The Active Learning in Physical Literacy intervention was effective in enhancing movement behavior and cognitive performance. Therefore, movement-centered pedagogy enables the integration of physical activity with learning, which in turn contributes to improving elements of children's physical literacy.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with various interpersonal difficulties. Previous research on empathy has indicated that weight is negatively correlated with empathic skills in children and adolescents. However, few studies have examined this question in adults, and the existing studies have provided inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta&#x2010;analysis aimed to examine empathic skills among people with overweight and obesity. Six databases were searched to find studies based on performance measures and self&#x2010;report questionnaires investigating cognitive and affective empathy in adults with overweight and obesity (BMI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;25&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared with normal&#x2010;weight individuals. Ten studies involving 2648 individuals were included after screening the 6779 references that were initially retrieved from the database. Analyses revealed a significant difference between individuals with overweight/obesity and normal&#x2010;weight individuals (k&#x2009;=&#x2009;11, Hedge's g&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;0.52 [&#x2212;0.97, &#x2212;0.07], Z&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2212;2.26, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.024). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant difference between people with overweight and people with obesity (Q&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.36, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.546). However, the effect size for cognitive empathy was higher than that for affective empathy (Q&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.30, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007), and the effect size for performances measures was higher than that for self&#x2010;report questionnaires (Q&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.61, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010). Adults with overweight or obesity present lower scores of empathy, particularly for cognitive empathy. These results emphasize the need to better understand which specific components of cognitive empathy might be affected and to conduct studies to evaluate affective empathy beyond self&#x2010;report questionnaires. Future research should also determine the underlying mechanisms and longitudinally test the role of empathy in the onset and maintenance of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Splint therapy is a common treatment approach for temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), but the role of doctor-patient communication in enhancing therapeutic outcomes remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the impact of integrating a structured doctor-patient communication concept with splint therapy on psychological and clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction in managing TMDs. A randomised clinical trial was conducted on patients diagnosed with TMDs at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department Clinics, Mansoura University. 435 participants were randomised into two groups: the control group (splint therapy alone) and the study group (splint therapy combined with doctor-patient communication). The psychological distress evaluated using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-10 (DASS-10) and clinical outcomes, including intra-articular pain, unassisted maximal interincisal mouth opening, joint sounds and muscular pain, were measured at baseline (before intervention) and 6&#x2009;months post-intervention. Patient satisfaction was analysed based on overall clinical satisfaction and postoperative expectations at 6 and 12&#x2009;months after the intervention. Significant improvements in clinical and psychological outcomes were observed within both groups at 6&#x2009;months compared to baseline (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The study group showed significantly improved anxiety and stress levels (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), better clinical outcomes (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), higher overall clinical satisfaction and better alignment with postoperative expectations at 6&#x2009;months (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) compared to the control group. Integrating a structured doctor-patient communication concept with splint therapy significantly enhances psychological and clinical outcomes in managing TMDs, particularly enhancing long-term satisfaction and alignment with postoperative expectations.

    "abstract": "To synthesize the results of qualitative research on family involvement in the care of adult ICU patients under family-centered care, to understand their experiences and perspectives, and to analyze the influences and future requirements of this process. The search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis report (PRISMA 2020). A comprehensive search of eight databases was conducted for qualitative research on family involvement in adult ICU care. The quality of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist, and meta-aggregation methods were used to extract, categorize and synthesize data. Ten studies were included, of which 69 findings were extracted, and similar results were categorized and grouped into 13 categories, resulting in four synthesized findings, including Purpose of family involvement, Factors influencing family involvement, Preferences for family involvement and Requirements for family involvement. To provide a systematic family perspective on family-centered care by reviewing qualitative findings on family involvement in the care of adult ICU patients, understanding the purpose, preferences, and factors influencing family involvement, and identifying future requirements and directions for family involvement in the adult intensive care unit. This review emphasizes the importance and necessity of family involvement in ICU care, clarifies the attitudes, preferences and influencing factors from the family's perspective, suggests assessing their ability to participate and giving them free choices, strengthens guidance and education, and promotes the establishment of a good cooperative relationship between families and healthcare professionals. In addition, the external construction of ICU family involvement, including the environment and policies, should be actively improved.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms, especially rapidly growing ones like TikTok, are increasingly used to disseminate health information. Its interactive features promote user participation, allowing for the sharing of experiences and raising awareness about specific medical conditions, while also simplifying complex procedures. This study aimed to explore the possible influence of TikTok short-video application on the education of surgical patients. A systematic search was performed in compliance with the PRISMA checklist. The research protocol was registered with the PROSPERO register (CRD42024551646). A search was performed in the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from inception to 2024. The search terms used were \"TikTok AND Surgery,\" \"TikTok AND Surgical Education,\" and \"TikTok AND surgery AND patient.\" The present systematic search resulted in 697 citations, of which 50 relevant citations were included. The search revealed that TikTok has widely used among patients from different surgical specialties and has an influence on their education. The platform facilitates public health awareness, allowing surgeons to share educational content, including surgical techniques and patient-oriented information. As one of the rapidly growing social media platforms, TikTok is increasingly utilised to disseminate health information. It has been adopted across various surgical specialties. While the platform presents a great opportunity to improve the education of surgical patients, it presents challenges related to the accuracy of information, potential misinformation, and lack of regulation. Surgeons and healthcare professionals should actively participate in creating accurate, evidence-based content that enhances patient education and promotes public health awareness.",

    "abstract": "There is a focus globally on reducing restrictive practices in mental healthcare. However, we know little about how service users experience restrictive practices generally. To explore and synthesise experiences of restrictive practices in adult inpatients mental health settings and to report on the depth and breadth of the literature. Methods. CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, MEDLINE and Embase were searched. Qualitative studies exploring the service user experience of restrictive practices were included and analysed using meta-ethnographic synthesis. Twenty-seven papers were included. Restrictive practices are experienced negatively by service users, who feel punished and powerless when the therapeutic relationship is weak, and communication is lacking. The third-order constructs were: (1) anti-therapeutic and dehumanising, (2) a vicious cycle, (3) an abuse of power and (4) the critical role of support and communication (subthemes: (i) the impact of communication and (ii) how support and communication can minimise negative impacts). Participants suggest that increasing supportive communication and detailing the decision making for using restrictive practices, would reduce feelings of coercion and increase trust in staff. Future research into the experience of restrictive practice should aim to capture the experience of informal restrictive practices such as locked doors and coercive language. The review has been conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; see Supplemental Materials Table S1) and the Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guidelines (eMERGE; see Supplemental Materials Table S2).

    "title": "Evaluating the use of text-message reminders and personalised text-message reminders on the return of participant questionnaires in trials, a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Randomised controlled trials are widely accepted as the gold standard research methodology for the evaluation of interventions. However, they often display poor participant retention. To prevent this, various participant interventions have been identified and evaluated through the use of studies within a trial. Two such interventions are participant short message service reminders (also known as text-messages) and personalised participant short message service reminders, designed to encourage a participant to return a study questionnaire. While previous studies within a trial have evaluated the effectiveness of these two retention strategies, trialists continue to spend both time and money on these strategies while the evidence remains inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the use of short message service reminders with no short message service reminder and personalised short message service reminders with non-personalised short message service reminders, on participant retention. Eligible studies were identified through advanced searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) and hand-searching of alternative information sources. The review primary outcome was the proportion of study questionnaires returned for the individual study within a trial primary analysis time points. Nine eligible studies within a trial were identified, of which four compared short message service versus no short message service and five compared personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service. For those that compared personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service, only three were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis. The primary outcome results for short message service versus no short message service concluded that short message service led to a statistically non-significant increase in the odds of study questionnaire return by 9% (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.92 to 1.30). Similarly, comparison of personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service concluded that personalised short message service caused a statistically non-significant increase in odds by 22% (odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 0.95 to 1.59). The effectiveness of both short message service and personalised short message service as retention tools remains inconclusive and further study within a trial evaluations are required. However, as short message services are low in cost, easy to use and generally well accepted by participants, it is suggested that trialists adopt a pragmatic approach and utilise these reminders until further research is conducted. Given both the minimal addition in cost for studies already utilising short message service reminders and some evidence of effect, personalisation should also be considered.",

    "abstract": "Black perinatal people in the United States are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality. An emerging hypothesis is that these disparities may be in part due to poor communication in obstetric care which may lead to poor perinatal care quality and adverse health outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide a systematic review of the literature on patient-clinician communication amongst Black patients in perinatal healthcare settings. A literature search was conducted for studies published between January 2006 to December 2024 using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. PRISMA guidelines were followed to extract relevant articles and study methodologies and results were synthesized. A total of 11 qualitative and 18 quantitative studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, findings indicate reliable evidence of Black patients' reports of discrimination, being left out of decision-making, and being ignored by their clinicians. We discuss methodological limitations of the work and suggest improvements. The results of this review may inform interventions to target the quality of communication between perinatal clinicians and their Black patients to improve morbidity and mortality outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Patients often struggle with psychological and social stressors that accompany life-limiting chronic illness. Because psychosocial concerns may be conveyed through emotional sentiments, this study aimed to identify emotional expressions to describe psychosocial contexts communicated during goals of care conversations. This qualitative study evaluated 26 transcripts of goals of care conversations using a \"goals of communication guide\" from the ADvancing system Alleviation with Palliative Treatment (ADAPT) trial in VA Eastern Colorado and Puget Sound Health Systems. Using an inductive and deductive approach, a codebook was developed to examine participants' expressed emotions regarding overall goals of care, illness, end of life, and family involvement. Major themes around psychosocial concerns were summarized. Four themes on psychosocial contexts in goals of care conversations emerged, with instances of both positive and negative affect. Participants commonly discussed contexts relating to: acceptance of illness, the feeling of being a burden; illness transitions; and suffering from disease. Unprompted within these conversations, patient emotional sentiments in goals of care conversations highlight psychosocial contexts important to patient values and preferences around treatment decisions. Emphasis on clinician recognition of these psychosocial contexts may help clinicians better support and elicit patient goals and preferences.",

    "abstract": "Some scholars have suggested that social and cultural barriers between physicians and patients might contribute to health disparities. The purpose of this review was to determine the state of evidence regarding how physician communication patterns differ by patient ethnicity. Seventy-nine studies employing a range of methodologies were identified. Results were mixed, with about three-quarters of analyses finding no differences in physician communication by ethnicity, and a small number of analyses finding that Black and Hispanic patients experienced better physician communication than White patients. About one-fifth of analyses reported that Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native patients had poorer experiences of physician communication than White patients. This was the case both for studies that operationalized patient-provider communication as behavior (what physicians did, measured via content analysis), and those that operationalized it as judgment (how patients interpreted that behavior, measured via survey or focus group interview). Methodological limitations in the corpus of the literature make it difficult to determine which contexts and characteristics lead patients from minoritized groups to have better, equivalent, or worse experiences than White patients.",

    "abstract": "Access to intervention is a barrier for children with autism. As parent-mediated interventions have emerged to address this need, understanding implementation components contributing to child gains is critically important. Existing literature documents relationships between parent treatment adherence and child progress; however, less is understood about components, such as frequency of learning opportunities, which could also affect child outcomes. This study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating Pivotal Response Treatment group parent training (PRTG) compared to psychoeducation. Linear regression and mediational models were employed to identify potential predictors and mediators of outcome. PRTG produced large increases in adherence and learning opportunities. In general, greater frequency of learning opportunities and adherence predicted better child outcomes. The best-fitting cross-sectional mediational models indicated at least partial mediational effects, whereby increased learning opportunities mediated the relationship between greater adherence and improved child outcomes. This study provides preliminary evidence of how early gains in adherence may support parents to provide more frequent learning opportunities, which, in turn, yield positive effects on child social communication. Future large-scale research, with greater granularity of measurement, is needed to further understand the temporal relationships between these variables.",

    "abstract": "The field of speech emotion recognition (SER) encompasses a wide variety of approaches, with artificial intelligence technologies providing improvements in recent years. In the domain of mental health, the links between individuals' emotional states and pathological diagnoses are of particular interest. This study aimed to investigate the performance of tools combining SER and artificial intelligence approaches with a view to their use within clinical contexts and to determine the extent to which SER technologies have already been applied within clinical contexts. The review includes studies applied to speech (audio) signals for a select set of pathologies or disorders and only includes those studies that evaluate diagnostic performance using machine learning performance metrics or statistical correlation measures. The PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, and ScienceDirect databases were queried as recently as February 2025. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool was used to measure the risk of bias. A total of 14 articles were included in the final review. The included papers addressed suicide risk (3/14, 21%), depression (8/14, 57%), and psychotic disorders (3/14, 21%). SER technologies are mostly used indirectly in mental health research and in a wide variety of ways, including different architectures, datasets, and pathologies. This diversity makes a direct assessment of the technology challenging. Nonetheless, promising results are obtained in various studies that attempt to diagnose patients based on either indirect or direct results from SER models. These results highlight the potential for this technology to be used within a clinical setting. Future work should focus on how clinicians can use these technologies collaboratively.

    "title": "Large Language Models in Lung Cancer: Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "In the era of data and intelligence, artificial intelligence has been widely applied in the medical field. As the most cutting-edge technology, the large language model (LLM) has gained popularity due to its extraordinary ability to handle complex tasks and interactive features. This study aimed to systematically review current applications of LLMs in lung cancer (LC) care and evaluate their potential across the full-cycle management spectrum. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search across 6 databases up to January 1, 2025. Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) journal articles, conference papers, and preprints; (2) studies that reported the content of LLMs in LC; (3) including original data and LC-related data presented separately; and (4) studies published in English. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) books and book chapters, letters, reviews, conference proceedings; (2) studies that did not report the content of LLMs in LC; and (3) no original data, and LC-related data that are not presented separately. Studies were screened independently by 2 authors (SC and ZL) and assessed for quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, and Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions tools, selected based on study type. Key data items extracted included model type, application scenario, prompt method, input and output format, outcome measures, and safety considerations. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics. Out of 706 studies screened, 28 were included (published between 2023 and 2024). The ability of LLMs to automatically extract medical records, popularize general knowledge about LC, and assist clinical diagnosis and treatment has been demonstrated through the systematic review, emerging visual ability, and multimodal potential. Prompt engineering was a critical component, with varying degrees of sophistication from zero-shot to fine-tuned approaches. Quality assessments revealed overall acceptable methodological rigor but noted limitations in bias control and data security reporting. LLMs show considerable potential in improving LC diagnosis, communication, and decision-making. However, their responsible use requires attention to privacy, interpretability, and human oversight.",

Most of the 15 eligible studies reviewed obtained significant results in improving relationship satisfaction, and these effects were often sustained at follow-up. A meta-analysis of six studies revealed a significant, moderate effect size. However, the detected heterogeneity points to variability in intervention effectiveness, which may be attributable to differences in program design, participant population, and delivery method. Digital-based interventions are particularly promising for enhancing relationship satisfaction in couples.",

Results of a fill and trim sensitivity analysis were similar in the size of the effect to the original results. The two studies with sex-specific results indicated that boys appeared to be more sensitive to MeHg-related language/verbal function decrements when compared with girls.

To fill this gap, this secondary analysis of the three-armed clinical randomized controlled Age-Well trial compares the impact of an 18-month meditation training to an 18-month non-native language training, and a passive control group on self-reports of loneliness and post-training reactions to experimentally induced social exclusion in 137 cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older adults (age &#x2265; 65 years). Multilevel models revealed that both interventions reduced loneliness from pre- to post-intervention compared to the no-intervention group. No group differences were observed regarding self-reported emotional reactions to social exclusion. Taken together, our results suggest that sharing regular activities with the same group of persons for a long period reduces older adults' loneliness.",

    "abstract": "Personalized out-of-hospital management could significantly improve quality of life of breast cancer patients. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy, effectiveness, safety, personalization and emotional care of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the out-of-hospital management of breast cancer. We established a data cleaning and classification pipeline to summarize three major scenarios of out-of-hospital management. Authentic electronic health record (EHR) datasets for data collection were generated using 10 patients with ID information masked from Breast Cancer Database in Affiliated Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University. Then we matched the EHR datasets with three out-of-hospital management scenarios as 100 virtual patients (VPs) for LLMs to perform the conversation generation using GPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1. Further, we incorporated four human specialists to rate the responses of LLMs in five dimensions using Likert scale. As of April 1, 2025, the 4 evaluator specialists rated the conversations of LLMs and 100 VPs. The results demonstrate that both DS-R1and GPT-o3 performed well, with scores primarily concentrated at 3 and 4 points. We revealed statistically significant differences between DS-R1and GPT-o3 in accuracy, personalization, and emotional care (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). However, the P-values for effectiveness and safety were 0.231 and 0.086. Furthermore, DS-R1generated more tokens (approximately 1.8 times) in identical time with less economic cost, and it also had shorter response time than GPT-o3. GPT-o3 and DS-R1 demonstrated personalized, empathetic, and accurate performance in the out-of-hospital management for breast cancer patients. DS-R1 had better overall performance than GPT-o3, especially in personalization, emotional care and accuracy. More research is warranted in the development specific knowledge embedding LLMs to reduce the detractors like hallucinatory or verbose responses.",

A systematic search of literature published before December 2024 identified 46 studies with 31,147 participants and 157 independent effect sizes. A three-level meta-analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between parent- adolescent conflict and depression. The overall analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between parent- adolescent conflict and depression (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.267, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The study design influenced this association, with a stronger correlation in cross-sectional studies (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.320, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) compared to longitudinal studies (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.227, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Moderator analysis revealed that the measurement tool and publication year were significant moderators. The correlation was stronger when measured with the NRI (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.341, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) and in more recent studies (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.264, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). These findings show that research design and measurement tools affect the link between parent- adolescent conflict and adolescent depressive mood, highlighting the need for future studies to consider these factors and their broader implications for fostering positive parent- adolescent relationships.",

    "abstract": "Amid the alarming global forecast of age-related cognitive-communicative disorders like dementia, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) are poised to play a crucial role in dementia-related services, ranging from counselling to end-of-life care. A key step in this direction is enhancing public health literacy regarding optimal age-linked cognitive-communicative health. Given the potential of educational multimedia (EM) programs to promote public health literacy, and the recent development of one such EM in our research, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an SLP-designed and facilitated EM in changing young adults (YAs) knowledge and beliefs about cognitive health in the Indian context. In a randomized controlled trial, 220 YAs aged 18-25&#xa0;years were equally and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (EG) or the active control group (CG). The EG viewed an EM on cognitive health, while the CG watched an animated fictional video. Both groups completed a retrospective pre-post survey evaluating self-perceived knowledge, factual knowledge, and beliefs about cognitive health. The effect of the EM was analyzed using mixed-model ANOVA. A significant improvement in the EG compared to the CG across all three domains was observed. These findings highlight the efficacy of the EM in enhancing understanding and attitudes toward cognitive health among YAs. The EM shows promise as a structured cognitive health education tool, fostering awareness, encouraging preventive measures, and potentially contributing to early detection and intervention of cognitive health issues. This study aligns with the emerging role of SLPs in educating communities about cognitive-communicative health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder associated with considerable physical, psychological and social burdens. Despite increasing recognition, diagnostic delays remain common, often prompting patients to seek information online. In this systematic review, we evaluated the quality and readability of HS-related information across artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, search--engine-derived resources and social media platforms. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar identified 17 studies published between 2017 and 2024 that assessed HS-related online content using validated scoring tools and/or physician evaluation. More than 50% of studies rated online HS materials as variable in quality, with 36% rating them as moderate. Readability -assessments revealed that most resources exceeded the recommended sixth-grade to eighth-grade school level, limiting accessibility for patients. Social media platforms, particularly TikTok and YouTube, featured highly engaging but frequently inaccurate or anecdotal content, with physician-generated materials receiving lower engagement than nonmedical resources. These findings highlight the critical need for simplified, -evidence-based online resources to improve health literacy and support informed decision-making by patients with HS. The prevalence of misinformation, particularly regarding alternative treatments and pharmaceutical scepticism, underscores the urgent need to develop enhanced patient education strategies. Future efforts should focus on AI-driven readability improvements, clinician engagement in digital education and collaboration with social media platforms to ensure the availability of accessible, high-quality HS information.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on the physical and mental health of older adults using meta-analysis and to analyze the moderating variables influencing this relationship. The goal was to provide a scientific basis for identifying effective exercise methods to enhance the physical and mental health of the older adults. A literature search was conducted in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 18.0 statistical software. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model, and relevant moderating variables were tested. The study findings indicated that physical activity significantly improves the physical and mental health of older adults across various dimensions. Specifically, it showed a large effect size for enhancing social interactions (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.14, 0.69], <i>P</i> = 0.0002), a medium effect size for improving physical health (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI [0.20, 0.48], <i>P</i> = 0.003), and a small effect size for improving mental health (SMD=0.34, 95% CI [0.37, 1.19], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). All differences were statistically significant. Physical exercise has a positive impact on improving the physical and mental health of older adults, particularly in enhancing physical health, psychological well-being, and social interactions.",

    "abstract": "Well-designed conversational agents can improve health care capacity to meet the dynamic and complex needs of people self-managing cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). However, a lack of empirical evidence on conversational agent-enabled intervention design features and their impact on engagement make it challenging to comprehensively evaluate effectiveness. This review synthesizes evidence on conversational agent-enabled intervention design features and how they impact on engagement to inform the development of more engaging conversational agent-enabled interventions that effectively help people with CMD to self-manage their condition. The aim of the study is to synthesize evidence pertaining to conversational agent-enabled intervention design features and their impact on engagement of people self-managing CMD. Searches were conducted in Ovid (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria were primary research studies reporting on conversational agent-enabled interventions that included measures of engagement and included adults with CMD. Data extraction captured perspectives of people with CMD on various design features of conversational agent-enabled interventions. Of 1366 studies identified for screening, 20 were included in the review. In total, 18 of these were qualitative or quasi-experimental evaluations of conversational agent-enabled intervention prototypes. Five domains of design features that impact user engagement with conversational agent-enabled interventions emerged: communication style, functionality, accessibility, visual appearance, and personality. Across all 5 domains, integrating redundancy and anthropomorphism were identified as effective strategies for improving engagement by increasing user autonomy and investment. Future research should adopt design strategies that are inclusive and adaptive to the diverse needs of users and aligned with the unique considerations relevant to conversational agent-enabled interventions.

    "title": "Virtual Health Assistants in Preventive Cancer Care Communication: Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Virtual health assistants (VHAs), interactive digital programs that emulate human communication, are being increasingly used in health care to improve patient education and care and to reduce the burden on health care providers. VHAs have the potential to promote cancer equity through facilitating patient engagement, providing round-the-clock access to information, and reducing language barriers. However, it is unclear to what extent audience-centeredness is being considered in the development of cancer-related applications. This systematic review identifies and synthesizes strategies used to make VHA-based cancer prevention and screening interventions audience-centered. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines, we searched 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost) for peer-reviewed studies on VHA interventions promoting cancer screening (January 2022). Included studies focused on adult populations in primary care settings, with interventions emphasizing interactivity and immediacy (key VHA features). Excluded studies were on cancer treatment, noninteractive decision aids, or technical VHA development. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool) were performed independently by multiple reviewers. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze audience-centered strategies. Of 1055 records screened, 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Most (n=11) targeted colorectal cancer, with others addressing prostate, breast, cervical, or lung cancer. A total of 16 studies were US-based; 1 study focused on Uganda. Key strategies for audience-centered design included: (1) Demographic Concordance: Race or gender alignment between VHA and users (eg, African American participants interacting with Black-coded avatars); (2) User Feedback: Iterative testing via interviews, think-aloud protocols, or pilot studies to refine interventions; (3) Preintervention Needs Assessment: Identifying cultural, linguistic, or literacy barriers (eg, myths about screening in Ugandan communities); (4) Theoretical Frameworks: The Health Belief Model (most common), the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model, or tailored messaging theories guided design; (5) Information Customization: Culturally adapted content (eg, Spanish-language interfaces, narratives addressing racial disparities); and (6) Feature Customization: Adjusting VHA appearance (eg, animations and fonts) based on user preferences. Notably, 7/17 studies focused on racially minoritized groups (eg, African Americans, Hispanic farmworkers), addressing systemic barriers like mistrust in health care. However, gaps persisted in intersectional tailoring (eg, rurality and income) and non-English languages (only 2/17 studies). Recruitment methods influenced diversity; community-based strategies yielded more representative samples than solely internet-based recruitment approaches. The systematic review identified the audience-centered development practices currently being used for VHA-based interventions in preventive cancer care. The majority of the studies included processes to diversify and segment the intended audience, focused on medically underrepresented population groups, and implemented strategies to be culturally sensitive to the population of interest. However, opportunities remain to address multidimensional inequities (eg, rural access and low literacy). Future interventions should integrate intersectional frameworks, expand language diversity, and measure social presence to enhance engagement. This review provides a roadmap for developing equity-focused eHealth tools in cancer prevention.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) has advanced in medical education, offering enhanced realism and immersion, allowing students to safely practice complex and rare scenarios like cancer truth-telling. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a VR-based cancer truth-telling module. This experimental study randomly assigned fifth-year medical students to the following groups: in-person communication skills training (iCST), VR, and a combined iCST+VR group. The intervention included a 30-minute video-based mini-lecture followed by practical application. The VR group received the VR truth-telling module, the iCST group received the small-class iCST module, and the iCST +VR group received both the iCST and VR modules. Primary outcomes assessed were cancer truth-telling perspectives, with communication confidence and learning satisfaction as a secondary outcome. Data were collected at baseline, immediately after, and at three and six months post-intervention. Seventy-nine medical students were enrolled and randomly assigned to the iCST (n = 28), VR (n = 29) and iCST +VR (n = 22) groups. The study findings showed that the iCST+VR group significantly improved in cancer truth-telling perspectives at six months post-intervention. No significant difference was found between iCST and VR groups for cancer truth-telling perspectives. Although communication confidence scores significantly improved across all groups, no differences were found between groups. The iCST group reported higher learning satisfaction compared to other groups, with no significant difference between VR and iCST+VR. This study demonstrated that VR is as effective as iCST in enhancing cancer truth-telling perspectives and communication confidence, highlighting VR's potential as an innovative tool in medical education.",

    "abstract": "The global penetration of mobile phones has offered novel opportunities for communicating health-related information to individuals. A low-cost system that facilitates autonomous communication with individuals via mobile phones holds potential for expanding the reach of health messaging in settings with human resource and infrastructure limitations. We sought to design a flexible, low-code system using open-source software that could be adapted to different contexts and technical environments and accommodate a wide range of automation needs. We report on key details of the mobile phone-based appointment reminder and incentive system (mParis), document its use, review implementation challenges and adaptations to address these challenges in the context of a quasi-randomized trial of mobile phone-based reminders and incentives as means of increasing the timeliness of childhood vaccinations in Tanzania, and outline other use cases that highlight the versatility of the system. The mParis instance described in this paper, which is hosted in Tanzania, sent automated, individualized vaccination reminders in the form of SMS text messages to the mobile phones of mothers of young children. Process workflows, based on the national vaccination schedule of Tanzania, were programmed into mParis. Reminders for vaccinations due at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks were sent 7 days and 1 day before and 14 days after each vaccination due date. A subset of messages included financial incentive offers to mothers for the timely vaccination of their children. We report on implementation outcomes, challenges, and adaptations to address these challenges. Between August and December 2017, a total of 412 pregnant women were enrolled in the trial. After mothers reported the birth of their children, individualized vaccination reminder messages were sent for vaccination due dates between January and July 2018. From March 2018, messages contained financial incentive offers. Of 1397 messages sent, 1122 (80.3%) messages were recorded as delivered, 249 (18.8%) as expired and resent; 23 (1.6%) as failed, and 3 (0.2%) as sent but lacking a delivery confirmation. In total, 633 (45.3%) messages contained incentive offers. Of 173 women who received at least 1 message, 67 (38.7%) were sent reminders only; 106 (61.3%) women were sent at least 1 incentivized message. Numerous challenges were encountered during the system's implementation, despite its deliberate design to accommodate basic problems, such as intermittent internet access and power failures. Continuous adaptation to increase the resilience of the system resulted in a successful deployment. mParis' open-source nature, auditability, and ability to autonomously execute algorithms in a low-resource setting with frequent infrastructure challenges suggest favorable prospects to automate health communication in a wide range of settings. mParis' use in other applications, including enrollment and follow-up for health-related research studies, demonstrates its versatility and ability to accommodate diverse challenges that may be encountered.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aimed to examine the association between hearing loss and social integration as well as the effectiveness of audiologic rehabilitation interventions. Academic databases were comprehensively searched up to December 2023 to identify relevant cross-sectional cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 45 years and older. Outcome effects were reported as odds ratios (<i>OR</i>s) for observational studies and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for intervention studies, and pooled analyses were conducted using the random-effects model. A total of 36 articles published in either Chinese or English were included in this meta-analysis: 11 cohort studies involving 52,037 participants, 23 cross-sectional studies involving 142,067 participants, and two RCTs involving 141 participants. Overall, hearing loss was associated with significantly greater odds of social isolation (<i>OR</i> = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.09, 1.31]) and social inactivity (low level of social participation: <i>OR</i> = 1.32, 95% CI [1.13, 1.54]; high level of social participation: <i>OR</i> = 0.85, 95% CI [0.79, 0.91]) among middle-aged and older adults. No significant effects of audiologic rehabilitation interventions on social integration were found (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.46, 0.89]). This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that hearing loss increases the risk of social isolation and reduces social participation among middle-aged and older adults. These findings highlight the importance of providing hearing-related services to enhance social integration in the aging population. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.29941460.",

    "abstract": "Rates of loneliness have risen sharply since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, largely due to disruptions in social relationships and daily routines, with college students experiencing some of the greatest increases. While prevention programs targeting loneliness have been developed, their success has been limited. One promising approach may lie in enhancing the quality of existing relationships rather than simply increasing social interactions during periods of acute loneliness. Relational savoring, an intervention rooted in attachment theory and positive psychology, aims to deepen feelings of connection by encouraging individuals to reflect on positive interpersonal experiences. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a mobile health adaptation of relational savoring, termed mSavorUs (developed by Amir Rahmani), designed to prevent and reduce loneliness among college students. A randomized controlled pilot study was conducted with a diverse sample of 29 college students (43.3% Latinx, 40% Asian American, and 16.7% White). The intervention leveraged a smart ring, smartwatch, and smartphone app to enable just-in-time delivery of relational savoring prompts, alongside continuous monitoring of loneliness-related indicators (eg, physiological activity, sleep, and behavior). Aim 1 involved a thematic analysis of participant feedback regarding the utility, benefits, and challenges of both mSavorUs and the monitoring tools. Aim 2 examined the intervention's effects on loneliness and perceived connectedness. For aim 1, qualitative findings suggested that participants found the content of mSavorUs (developed by Amir Rahmani) rewarding and helpful; however, the timing of the intervention was often experienced as disruptive. For aim 2, quantitative analyses revealed no significant reductions in loneliness or increases in connectedness, indicating the need for adjustments to the intervention delivery method. Although participants found the intervention content valuable, the just-in-time delivery format may have limited its effectiveness. Future iterations should consider alternative timing or delivery strategies to maximize program benefits.",

This study explores an interactive VR-Motion serious game designed for children with ASD, leveraging immersive, controlled environments to enhance social skills, self-care, and emotional regulation. Children with autism often suffer from multiple complications; thus, new serious games that are versatile and easy to use are more suitable for them. This study aims to design and develop a versatile serious game for multifaceted intervention in children with autism, encompassing psychological, social, and learning aspects. We also aim to evaluate the rationality of its design and the effectiveness of its content, with the ultimate goal of providing an effective intervention therapy for children with autism. This study used the methods of pre-experiment and formal experiment. The pre-experiment (<i>n</i>&#x202f;=&#x202f;2): Control group (Average Age&#x202f;=&#x202f;123.8&#x202f;months, SD&#x202f;=&#x202f;32.27&#x202f;months) experimental group (Average Age&#x202f;=&#x202f;119.4&#x202f;months, SD&#x202f;=&#x202f;29.41&#x202f;months), in which one male and one female was trained 4 times a week for 4&#x202f;h each time for 3&#x202f;weeks.

    "abstract": "Mood stabilizer therapy is a prevalent intervention for bipolar disorder (BD). This work aimed at reviewing the knowledge on the cognitive effects of mood stabilizers in patients with BD. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library and PsycInfo databases. Data extraction followed PRISMA guidelines, and quality assessment adhered to the Cochrane Handbook. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 software. Our meta-analysis of 570 patients from nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that mood stabilizer treatments in adolescent BD patients significantly improved emotional processing accuracy (standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.18 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-1.69, -0.67], p &lt; 0.00001), while prolonging reaction time (SMD -0.39 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.73, -0.05], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02). However, attention (SMD 0.21 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.16, 0.58], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.27) and working memory (SMD -0.09 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.19, 2.00], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.93) in adolescents, as well as overall cognitive functioning (SMD 0.48 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.49, 1.45], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.33) in adults, were not significantly affected. Similarly, lithium treatment showed no significant impact on attention in adolescents (SMD 0.21 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.16, 0.58], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.27) or overall cognitive functioning in adults (SMD 0.43 [95&#xa0;% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.50, 1.35], p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.37). Mood stabilizer treatments may enhance emotional processing accuracy while extending reaction times in adolescents, without compromising overall cognitive functioning or specific cognitive domains. Further research is warranted to substantiate these preliminary findings.",

A systematic search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on reminiscence therapy for cognitively impaired older adults was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, CBM, VIP, and Wanfang databases from inception to October 2024. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (ROB 2.0). Data were extracted using standardized forms and analyzed with Review Manager version 5.4 and Stata version 18.0. A total of 18 studies were included, of which 14 studies (19 trials) provided complete data for meta-analysis. Study settings included hospitals, nursing facilities, and community centers, with all interventions based on simple recall reminiscence. Meta-analysis showed a significant effect of reminiscence therapy on cognitive function in older adults with cognitive impairment (SMD=1.15, 95%CI: 0.78-1.52, P&lt;0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed greater effectiveness in participants from Asia (SMD=1.50, 95%CI: 0.98-2.01, P&lt;0.001) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)(SMD=1.56, 95%CI: 0.78-2.34, P&lt;0.001). The optimal delivery strategies involved group sessions with more than six participants (SMD=1.63, 95%CI: 0.48-2.78, P=0.005), conducted weekly (SMD=1.37, 95%CI: 0.83-1.91, P&lt;0.001) for 30-45 minutes per session (SMD=1.29, 95%CI: 0.59-1.99, P&lt;0.001), over a 12-week period (SMD=1.60, 95%CI: 0.83-2.38, P&lt;0.001). Reminiscence therapy effectively improves cognitive function in older adults with cognitive impairment, especially those with MCI. It is recommended as an early non-pharmacological intervention delivered through weekly group sessions of 30-45 minutes, with six or more participants over at least 12 weeks. Future research should involve high-quality studies with extended follow-up periods to fully validate the sustained effectiveness of reminiscence therapy.",

    "title": "Advancements in artificial intelligence transforming medical education: a comprehensive overview.",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing medical education by introducing innovative tools and reshaping traditional teaching and learning methods. AI technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, adaptive learning platforms, and AI-driven assessments are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance diagnostic precision, clinical decision-making, and personalized learning experiences. This narrative review explores the current trends, challenges, and innovations associated with the integration of AI in medical education. It aims to critically examine how AI transforms teaching and learning processes while addressing ethical concerns and practical barriers. We performed a systematic literature search across three major databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for publications dated 2010-2024. Our search strategy employed key terms including 'artificial intelligence,' 'medical education,' and 'AI-based learning platforms' to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles, review papers, and case studies. After screening and selection, 67 studies met our inclusion criteria for final analysis. AII technologies improve learning outcomes by creating personalized, immersive, and interactive environments. They support clinical decision-making and procedural skills training while addressing diverse learner needs. However, ethical issues like data privacy, algorithmic biases, and equitable access, coupled with challenges like faculty resistance and technological infrastructure gaps, limit broader adoption. AI is an important tool in medical education, offering significant opportunities to enhance learning outcomes and bridge educational gaps. However, its successful integration requires ethical frameworks, faculty training, and equitable resource allocation. A balanced approach that combines technological innovation with human-centered pedagogy is essential to preserve empathy and ethical care in healthcare.",

    "title": "Preparing 4th and 5th graders to learn algebra with worked examples and self-explanation prompts.",
    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of the MathByExample intervention, which integrates worked examples and self-explanation prompts into math worksheets to address 4th and 5th graders' misconceptions. Researchers conducted a year-long, classroom-based experiment in 58 U.S. classrooms, randomly assigning classrooms to experimental or control conditions. The study explored the intervention's impact on algebra readiness and the moderating effects of prior knowledge and intervention dosage. Results showed no significant overall impact of the intervention on foundational algebra knowledge (FAK) or preparation for future learning (PFL). However, further analysis provided key insights. For FAK scores, greater self-explanation prompt attempts improved learning, but only when students engaged with a high number of worksheets. Students with higher prior knowledge experienced a negative effect of attempting more worksheets, suggesting they may not benefit from excessive practice. Self-explanation attempts had a stronger positive effect for students with higher prior knowledge. For PFL scores, self-explanation attempts significantly improved PFL scores, but only for students with at least average prior knowledge, with the strongest effects seen in those completing more worksheets. These findings suggest that educators may benefit from actively incorporating the study and explanation of worked examples into elementary math instruction. To maximize their impact, teachers should regularly integrate worked examples into their lessons. Encouraging students to engage with worked examples through self-explanation may mitigate common misconceptions and enhance students' readiness for more advanced algebra concepts.",

    "abstract": "Childhood trauma has profound, long-term effects on cognitive and emotional development. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to synthesis the evidence around the long-term impact of human childhood trauma on domains of cognition and emotion in order to inform interventions and public health strategies. We systematically reviewed 465 studies from PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, 9 studies were included after duplicates were removed and inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and all 9 studies were aimed at low-income people in the United States. Data on study design, trauma types, and cognitive/emotional outcomes were extracted. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2). Random-effects meta-analysis and subgroup analyses (processing speed, attention, working memory, emotion regulation, executive function) were conducted using R software. Childhood trauma was associated with significant deficits in: Attention (SMD = 2.37, 95% CI: [5.75, 10.50]) Working memory (SMD = 3.55, 95% CI: [2.18, 9.28]) Emotion regulation (SMD = 1.25, 95% CI: [1.12, 3.62]) Executive function (SMD = 1.61, 95% CI: [0.06, 3.28]) Processing speed showed smaller deficits (SMD&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.48, 95% CI: [-1.91, 0.94]). High heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>: 77-98%) reflected variability in trauma types and assessments. The pooled effect size (SMD = 1.57, 95% CI: [-0.12, 3.26]) highlighted trauma's pervasive impact. Childhood trauma disproportionately impairs attention and working memory. These findings, however, point to the importance of early screening, trauma-informed care and targeted interventions to ameliorate the long-term consequences of trauma, even with high heterogeneity. Methodological variability should be addressed to inform prevention and treatment strategies in future research, as well as resilience factors explored.",

    "title": "Impact of providing a customized guideline on virtual medical history taking in two serious games for medical education.",
    "abstract": "Serious games are known as safe learning environments, allowing medical students to train their skills without endangering patients' safety. By integrating virtual patients via chatbots, serious games provide the opportunity to practice history taking. The study investigated the impact of self-directed learning by means of a customized guideline on history taking in two distinct chatbot systems embedded in serious games. Fourth-year medical students (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;159) were randomized to one of two serious games, each representing an emergency department and simulating different clinical scenarios. Students played the serious games at two measurement points and received a guideline between both sessions. The chatbots differed in the manner of query entry, with one requiring students to formulate history taking questions themselves, while the other provided a long menu of selectable questions. The dependent variables analyzed included the history taking data entered into the chatbots, represented as a quantified history score, as well as students' comparative self-assessments of their learning outcomes. Comparing only the first measurement point, students achieved higher scores in the free-entry chatbot (85.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;27.7) compared to the long menu chatbot (78.8&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;35.7). Students achieved significantly higher scores in the second than in the first session in the long menu chatbot (<i>t</i>(315)&#x2009;=&#x2009;-2.918, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004, <i>d</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.229) but not in the free-entry chatbot after receiving the guideline. In terms of students' self-assessment, no significant difference between both serious games was found. The results suggest that history taking benefits from self-directed learning in a long menu format relying on cued recall but not in a free-entry chatbot relying on free recall. Since serious games are partially artificial learning environments for training history taking, future studies should examine the extent to which students can transfer their learning in and out of serious games.",

    "abstract": "Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have working memory (WM) impairment, which can be improved by virtual reality-based working memory (VR-WM) training; however, the specific neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify how VR-WM training improves WM in patients with MDD and further explore the role of the frontotemporal lobe in related neural mechanisms. A total of 57 patients with MDD were included in a randomized controlled study to clarify the effects of 20 sessions of VR-WM training on WM in patients with MDD and to explore the role of the frontotemporal lobe in associated neural mechanisms. The Stroop color word test, 2-back task, digit task switching, and digit span test were used to measure the inhibition, updating and switching functions of WM and WM span. The functional features of the frontotemporal lobe in patients with MDD at rest were detected using functional near-infrared spectroscopy before and after training. After VR-WM training, patients with MDD exhibited significant improvements in the accuracy of the Stroop color word test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013) and 2-back task (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002), the scores of digit span test (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.006). Significant group-by-time interactions of local efficiency (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005) and clustering coefficient (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004) of the frontotemporal lobe were observed between groups. The degree of improvement in the total score of the digit span test was positively correlated with the change in the clustering coefficient (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.034). VR-WM training effectively improved inhibition, updating and memory span in the WM of patients with MDD. Furthermore, VR-WM training was observed to enhance functional connectivity in the frontotemporal lobe, thereby improving WM performance in patients with MDD.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a serious problem among college students, and chatbots are a popular intervention tool. Social cues are used in chatbot design, but their effectiveness in depression treatment remains to be verified. This study aimed to compare the effects of chatbots with high-social-cue (HSC) versus low-social-cue (LSC) designs on depressive symptoms. An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted over 16&#xa0;weeks. Eighty-four college students with baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores &#x2265;9 were randomly assigned to either an HSC group (text + voice + animations) or LSC group (text-only).

    "abstract": "Altruistic punishment is crucial in promoting cooperation and maintaining social fairness. The third-party punishment (TPP) game, a typical paradigm testing altruistic punishment behavior, involves individuals incurring personal costs to punish norm violations others commit. This altruistic (costly) punishment has been suggested as an adaptive trait in human evolution, influencing behaviors such as mate selection. Additionally, testosterone levels and facial attractiveness are key factors affecting altruistic behavior and mating preferences, influencing how altruism is displayed and perceived in mating contexts. However, the causal effect of mate choice motives on altruistic punishment behavior is obscure. In this study, we combined exogenous testosterone administration and a TPP game to explore the effect of exogenous testosterone on men's altruistic punishment behavior toward female recipients of varying attractiveness. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects crossover design, 85 heterosexual men came to the lab twice, once receiving testosterone gel and the other time receiving a placebo gel. Our results showed that participants in the testosterone condition (compared to the placebo condition) exhibited a higher frequency of altruistic punishment behavior toward others in the presence of female recipients. The effects varied across different coin allocation conditions and female recipient facial attractiveness, with participants balancing the signaling of altruistic traits and protecting their resources. Our findings highlight the complex interaction between hormonal factors and mating-related cues, which appears to be associated with altruistic punishment behavior.",

    "title": "The effects of cannabis use disorder on cognitive functions: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Impairments in cognition are frequently associated with acute cannabis consumption; on the other hand, controversies persist regarding the residual cognitive impairments of cannabis, with some estimates highlighting significant or mild cognitive impairment. One of the main limitations of the available research syntheses is that little attention has been paid to individuals with cannabis use disorder. Thus, our main objectives are to determine the amplitude of the cognitive deficits associated with cannabis use disorder, and to identify the cognitive domains the most and least impaired. Studies with a patient group with a cannabis use disorder diagnosis and data from at least one validated neurocognitive test were selected. After manual extraction, data were pooled in a multivariate meta-analysis and effect size estimates were calculated for 13 cognitive domains. Meta-regression analyses on potential moderators were performed. There were small-to-moderate impairments in 10 out of the 13 cognitive domains. Deficits in verbal learning/memory, speed of processing and working memory were more prominent (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.4/0.5) whereas verbal fluency and attention were the least affected. No association was observed between the potential moderators and global cognition. This meta-analysis shows that cannabis use disorder is associated with moderate deficits in verbal learning/memory, speed of processing and working memory. Despite the limitation of the studies in the field, our results should serve as a reminder that the residual cognitive impairments associated with cannabis should not be under-estimated prematurely.",

    "abstract": "In this pre-registered study, we investigated the effects of acute cocoa flavanol (CF) consumption on cognitive control and response inhibition processes, at two different dosage levels. This crossover study was randomized, placebo-controlled, gender-balanced, and double-blind, and included 36 healthy adult participants. Participants consumed three different drinks across separate sessions: a placebo drink containing alkalized cocoa powder, a low-dose drink with 415 mg CF, and a medium-dose drink with 623 mg CF, both derived from flavanol-rich cocoa powder. Following each treatment, participants completed the Flanker, Simon, and Go/No-go tasks in a counterbalanced order. We analyzed accuracy and response times for congruent and incongruent trials in the Simon and Flanker tasks, and commission errors, omission errors, and response times in the Go/No-go task. The acute effects of CF on cognitive control and response inhibition were examined using (Generalized) Linear Mixed Model analysis, which included random intercepts, fixed effects, and random slopes. Results revealed that neither dose of CF acutely improved accuracy, interference scores, errors, or response times in these three tasks. Furthermore, neither participant gender nor BMI predicted performance in cognitive control or response inhibition beyond the effects of the treatment conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that acute cocoa flavanol consumption has no significant effect on cognitive control or response inhibition in healthy young adults.",

    "abstract": "Anhedonia is a hallmark symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), associated with impairments in various aspects of reward. VIVRE is the first study in patients with MDD receiving antidepressant therapy to include longitudinal assessment of reward behavior using the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a validated behavioral paradigm for the objective assessment of reward and effort-based decision-making in patients with MDD. Randomized, double-blind study of vortioxetine (10 or 20&#xa0;mg/day) versus desvenlafaxine (50&#xa0;mg/day) in adults with MDD and partial response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy. Motivation for reward based on the proportion of hard trial choices was assessed at baseline and after 8&#xa0;weeks of treatment. There was no difference in the proportion of hard trial choices between the vortioxetine (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;288) and desvenlafaxine (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;300) treatment groups at baseline. Minimal change in parameters of reward motivation was seen over the 8-week treatment period in either group. The between-group difference in the proportion of hard trial choices at week 8 was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.97 [95&#xa0;% CI: 0.82, 1.14]; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.72). Similar results were obtained when controlling for reward probability, reward magnitude, trial number, and sex, or when limiting to the first 50 trials (excluding computer-selected trials). Exploratory analyses evaluating the utility of the EEfRT in clinical populations. Experience from the VIVRE study suggests that further research is required to fully determine the clinical utility of the EEfRT for assessment of antidepressant treatment effects in patients with MDD.

    "title": "Comparing effects of episodic future thinking and cue salience to improve different types of prospective memory in typically developing school-age children.",
    "abstract": "Prospective memory (PM) enables children to remember future intentions and is central to their development. Yet, school-age children face difficulties with remembering planned or assigned tasks and it is therefore crucial to uncover the methods for improving their PM performance. The present study examined the effects of two prominent methods - encoding PM tasks through episodic future thinking (EFT) versus increasing the salience of PM cues - in improving event- and time-based PM of school-age children. In two experiments, 8-12&#xa0;year-old children (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;126 and 126 respectively) completed three PM tasks and tasks tapping working memory, inhibition and shifting ability. Children were randomly assigned to the standard PM instruction group, the EFT group, or the cue salience group. In Experiment 1 (event-based PM), the cue salience group outperformed the other two groups in two computer-based PM tasks but not in a more naturalistic PM task. In Experiment 2 (time-based PM), the cue salience group outperformed the other two groups in all PM tasks, and this did not impair ongoing task performance and the cue salience group monitored the time less frequently. Moreover, children with lower shifting abilities showing larger benefits of salient cues on time-based PM. In both experiments, the EFT and standard groups had similar PM performance. These findings suggest that salient PM cues can improve event- and time-based PM in school-age children whereas EFT may not improve PM performance compared to standard encoding. Future research should investigate children's ability to voluntarily set salient cues for completing daily PM tasks.",

    "title": "Efficacy of a mobile health with tailored personalized exercise rehabilitation program for ADHD children: randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Interventions delivered via mobile health (mHealth) could increase access to guided exercise interventions. We aimed to investigate effectiveness of a self-developed mHealth app-supported tailored exercise rehabilitation program on core symptoms (i.e., inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) and executive functions (EFs, specifically inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD aged 6-12 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;144) were randomly assigned to one of three groups and were offered interventions 3 times a week over a period of 12&#xa0;weeks, and each session lasted 45-60&#xa0;min. Experimental group 1 (EG1, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;53) received exercise interventions through videos from an exercise library that were recommended based on each participant's assessment results via mHealth used by both children and their parents. Experimental group 2 (EG2, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;45) received integrated merging of physically and cognitively demanding exercise interventions implemented offline by coaches, and control group (CG, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;46) received minimal intervention with physical activity education. Outcomes were parent-rated symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, which were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-version IV rating scale, and three EFs via the Stroop Color and Word Test for inhibitory control, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test for working memory, and the Trail Making Test for cognitive flexibility. A linear mixed effects model was used to investigate the intervention effect, and the dependent variable was changed from baseline to the endpoint. Potential confounding variables (i.e., age, sex, intelligence quotient, ADHD subtype, and medicine intake) were used as covariates. EG1 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-3.54, SE 0.96, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and EG2 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-3.98, SE 1.00, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) significantly reduced inattention scores compared to CG, and EG1 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.88, SE 0.81, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and EG2 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-3.50, SE 0.84, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) also significantly reduced hyperactivity/impulsivity scores compared with CG. EG1 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-8.48, SE 3.27, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.016) and EG2 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-9.41, SE 3.46, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.016) significantly improved inhibitory control compared with CG. EG1 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.00, SE 1.07, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and EG2 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.72, SE 1.14, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) significantly improved delayed details of working memory compared with CG.

    "title": "Embedding Social-Emotional Learning in Elementary School-Based Speech-Language Therapy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Many students with communication disorders have unique social-emotional needs, yet school speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are not typically trained in how to address those needs. We developed a new training (STIRS [SLP Training to Increase Resilience in Students]) to equip elementary school SLPs to embed social-emotional learning (SEL) practices within their routine speech-language sessions with K-3 students with communication disorders. The primary objective of this pilot trial was to evaluate the preliminary effects and feasibility of STIRS. This was a single-blind, parallel two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial with elementary school SLPs within a local education agency in Iowa. At a scheduled professional development meeting, the SLPs were randomly assigned to either the STIRS condition or active control condition (speech assessment of bilingual students). Both conditions involved a one-time 3-hr training. SLPs' attitudes, knowledge, and self-efficacy in addressing SEL with their K-3 students were measured immediately before and after the training. After the training, we also collected data on acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility to inform a future definitive trial. Twenty SLPs who attended the professional development meeting consented to participate, were randomized by remote web-based allocation, and completed both pretraining and posttraining measures (12 SLPs in the STIRS condition and eight in the active control condition). Compared to the control group, there was a small positive main effect of the STIRS training on SLPs' openness, knowledge, and self-efficacy immediately posttraining. The SLPs in the STIRS condition also reported adequate levels of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the training. The one-time STIRS training has the potential to increase SLPs' willingness and confidence to support SEL of K-3 students with communication disorders. In a future definitive trial, engagement could be enhanced through more clinical application training. Enrollment challenges may be mitigated by using a different design (e.g., team-based coaching, waitlist control).",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic stress condition associated with dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and cognitive and emotional comorbidities. Therefore, we aimed to examine the acute stress response integrity in adults with epilepsy and its relationship with affectivity, memory, and quality of life (QOL). This hybrid single-blind controlled study involved 3 groups: an experimental group (EG) of patients with epilepsy exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) during a neuropsychological assessment; a control group of patients with epilepsy who underwent neuropsychological testing without stress exposure; and a healthy group (HG) also exposed to the TSST. Patients were recruited from the Refractory Epilepsy Unit and randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. Six saliva samples were collected from all groups at consistent intervals to measure cortisol levels. Repeated measures analyses of covariance and Spearman correlations were performed. The sample consisted of 147 participants: 38 patients in the EG (50% women; 38.50 &#xb1; 10.92 years), 50 patients in the control group (48% women; 40.82 &#xb1; 8.55 years), and 59 individuals in the HG (58% women; 40.82 &#xb1; 8.55 years). The EG showed an abolition of the stress response and no differences with those not exposed to the TSST. The HG exhibited the expected cortisol response to stress with a rise in the area under the curve with respect to increase, which contrasts with the decreases observed in both groups of patients (<i>F</i><sub>(2,146)</sub> = 9.15, &#x3b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.11) with and without stress (mean difference [MD] = -107.90, 95% CI -176.75 to -39.05, and MD = -89.19, 95% CI -152.81 to -25.56, respectively). Cortisol production in the EG was related to lower seizure frequency (&#x3c1; = -0.40, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.08), and better memory retrieval (&#x3c1; = 0.43, 95% CI 0.15-0.68) and QOL (&#x3c1; = 0.40, 95% CI 0.10-0.65). Patients with epilepsy may exhibit a buffered cortisol response to acute stress. Preservation of this response is associated with better clinical, cognitive, and QOL outcomes. Despite limitations such as the cross-sectional design and sample specificity, these findings could help clarify the underlying mechanisms of stress-epilepsy interaction.",

To analyse the concept of \"life skills that promote school health in adolescents\" in the literature. Concept analysis followed the eight steps described by Walker and Avant. In the evidence synthesis, an integrative review was conducted, following the PRISMA 2020 methodological guidelines. The literature review was performed on the Web of Science platform, and in the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases, for articles published between 2020 and 2024, written in Spanish or English, and including qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods studies, or systematic reviews. Eighteen studies were included, from which four key attributes of life skills were identified: decision-making, effective communication, stress management, and problem solving. These skills contribute to reducing risky behaviours, improving resilience, and strengthening overall well-being. Despite the limited evidence linking life skills that promote adolescent school health these can be defined as a set of essential psychosocial competencies that enable adolescents to effectively cope with health-related challenges in school and social environments. The theoretical framework for understanding life skills provided in this study can be used to develop specific educational programs and interventions for adolescents.",

Literature was systematically searched in Chinese and English databases and screened using strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the literature. Meta-analyses were performed with RevMan 5.3 and Stata 16 software. We compared the application effects of the PBL-CBL teaching method versus the LBL teaching method in orthopedic education across multiple dimensions: theoretical knowledge mastery, practical skill proficiency, comprehensive competency development, and satisfaction with teaching methods. (1) 15 studies involving 980 participants were included.

(3) Heterogeneity was observed in the study (I<sup>2</sup> = 77-87%), which may be related to differences in teaching duration, case design, and assessment criteria. However, sensitivity analysis showed good stability of the results, indicating that the conclusions are informative. Meta-analysis demonstrates that, in orthopedic education, the PBL-CBL teaching method offers significant advantages over LBL in enhancing students' theoretical knowledge, clinical skills, and comprehensive abilities. It also stimulates learning interest, improves teaching satisfaction, and facilitates the cultivation of orthopedic clinical talent. However, its generalizability requires further verification through research in different countries.",

    "abstract": "Case-based learning (CBL), an innovative teaching approach distinct from traditional methodologies, has gained increasing popularity in pharmacy education. This study aims to conduct a systematic investigation into the effectiveness of CBL, offering evidence-based insights to inform future research and instructional practices in pharmacy education. A comprehensive search of related literature published prior to June 2023 was performed across seven databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, VIP China Science and Technology Journal, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Medline. Following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible studies underwent rigorous screening. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was utilized to assess methodological quality, with RevMan 5.4.1 employed for systematic review and meta-analysis. An initial retrieval yielded 2,267 studies, of which 11 studies involving 1,339 pharmacy students met the final inclusion criteria. Based on the studies included, the CBL group demonstrated significantly higher exam scores compared to the lecture-based learning (LBL) group (standardized mean difference [SMD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.39, 0.77], P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). In addition, CBL led to substantial enhancements in communication/collaboration skills (risk ratio [RR]&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.49, 95% CI [1.17, 5.27], P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), problem-solving abilities (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.19, 95% CI [1.26, 3.80], P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), and clinical practice skills (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.39, 95% CI [1.46, 3.92], P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

    "abstract": "Excessive Internet gaming has become an increasingly serious public health problem, closely related to changes in cognitive function (especially inhibitory control deficits and increased impulsivity) and related brain regions (such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC). As a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may improve these cognitive deficits by regulating the activity of DLPFC, but its specific effects and mechanisms in the excessive Internet gaming population still need to be further clarified. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) on excessive Internet game usage behavior. Fifty-seven excessive Internet game users were randomly divided into real tDCS stimulation (1.5&#x202f;mA,20&#x202f;min) and sham tDCS stimulation. We assessed their degree of impulsivity and inhibitory control of Internet gaming-related distractors before and after stimulation.Comparing pre- and post-stimulation with real versus sham tDCS, measures of inhibitory control (GO/NOGO task) and impulsivity (BIS-11) revealed no significant changes in the sham group. However, real tDCS significantly enhanced inhibitory control (increased total accuracy, decreased NOGO error rate, and prolonged GO reaction time) and significantly reduced impulsivity (decreased BIS-11 total and subscale scores).These results indicate that tDCS stimulating rDLPFC can enhance inhibitory control ability and reduce impulsivity, having a positive impact on excessive Internet gamers.",

    "abstract": "Neurofeedback training (NFT) is used to modulate brain activity for therapeutic purposes in different patient populations. However, tested training protocols vary in several aspects, and the results of therapeutic benefit have been heterogeneous. The aim of the current study was to compare a SMR against a random frequency protocol and potentially strengthen NFT effects via olfactory context reactivation during sleep in a compact training protocol. 49&#x2009;participants (mean age: 24.7&#x2009;years; 29 women) without any neurological or psychiatric disorder were randomly (double-blind) assigned to three groups: sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) with or without context reactivation, or random frequencies with reactivation during sleep. Within 2&#x2009;weeks, participants underwent eight training sessions (12&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;2 min training intervals) and slept three nights in the sleep lab. NFT sessions were scheduled every day or every other day for practical reasons. Nights two and three were used for reactivation. SMR training success was assessed at baseline, post treatment, and follow-up after 10&#x2009;months. Neurofeedback was provided as pixelated video, which became clearer with better training performance. Although SMR amplitude did not significantly increase, NFT training seemed to have an effect on alpha amplitude over the course of training (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08), and both SMR groups showed by tendency improved objective sleep (e.g., higher sleep efficiency in night 2 vs. baseline night, p<sub>corr</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07). Reactivation did not immediately affect performance or EEG response. However, during the follow-up session, NFT performance was highest in the SMR&#x2009;+&#x2009;reactivation condition (SMR&#x2009;+&#x2009;R&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;SMR-R, p<sub>corr</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02), which could indicate a stabilizing effect of reactivation during sleep. Our data again suggest that (SMR) NFT could foster general relaxation and sleep. Concerning context reactivation, we did, however, only find limited evidence for a potential benefit. Future studies could add more reactivation nights or potentially utilize other forms of context reactivation.",

    "abstract": "Flipped learning and escape room (gamification) are among the innovative teaching strategies frequently used in interactive education methods today, focusing on problem-solving learning. These methods are important in promoting achievement by taking responsibility for learning. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of flipped learning and the escape room method on nursing students' knowledge and skill learning about infection control. The study was a randomized controlled trial with open-label pretest-posttest. The research was conducted with 76 students in the experimental and control groups. In the study, while the experimental group students were taught using the flipped learning method, which is an effective way of learning outside the classroom, their learning was reinforced with gamification using the escape room method. These teaching methods also encouraged students to take responsibility for their own learning. Data were collected by administering the 'Characteristics Form for the Student Group', the 'Knowledge Test on Infection Control Measures' and the 'Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale'. The post-test and follow-up test knowledge scores of the experimental group are statistically significantly higher than those of the control group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and the difference has a high effect (d&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.15). When the total score and all sub-dimensions of the Self-Directed Learning Skills Scale were analysed, a significant increase was found between the pretest and posttest scores of the experimental group compared with the control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.033; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

    "title": "From Board Games to Box Trainers: Gamified Feedback in Laparoscopy Training for Medical Students.",
    "abstract": "Feedback plays a pivotal role in surgical training. Gamification offers a way to make the feedback process more efficient by automating and expediting feedback delivery, which might otherwise be difficult to provide. Prior data suggest that negative feedback may play a greater role in improving performance on laparoscopic skills tasks, whereas positive feedback may enhance learner satisfaction, confidence, and engagement. Automated immediate feedback systems are a potential gamification tool capable of reinforcing correct behaviors, identifying errors, and fueling motivation for surgical skills practice. By gamifying negative feedback and capitalizing on its immediacy, we investigate whether this approach can lead to changes in practice patterns and enhance learners' motivation to practice. Moreover, this study evaluates the impact of a laparoscopic skills simulator that delivers this automated, immediate, negative-only feedback on medical students' Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery peg transfer task performance. Forty-eight laparoscopy-na&#xef;ve medical students were randomly divided into two groups: (A) which trained with a modified 'Operation' board game featuring an auditory buzzer and (B) which used the same trainer with the buzzer disabled. Both groups practiced using laparoscopic Maryland dissectors within the box trainer apparatus, with solely the training board features differing. We tracked the total practice time each participant spent with their assigned simulator and measured preintervention and postintervention performance on the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery peg transfer task (McGill Inanimate System for Training and Evaluation of Laparoscopic Skills metrics). Fifty-two percent (52%; 25 of 48) of participants used the practice trainer at least once. Both groups practiced the same number of times, but during sessions group B practiced for significantly longer than group A (P = 0.03). Neither the amount of time practiced (B = -0.17, P = 0.44) nor the study group (B = 0.19, P = 0.40) was significantly associated with a greater improvement in performance. The 'Operation' trainer's automated negative-only feedback delivery mechanism discouraged laparoscopic skills practice among novices. While the 'Operation' trainer's automated negative-only feedback delivery mechanism decreased novice learners' practice duration at any given session, it did not appear to impact motivation to practice again. Future studies should evaluate the roles of mixed, immediate feedback delivery models and appropriately calibrating task difficulty to achieve desirable difficulty in cultivating practice habits.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of integrating standardized patients with the situational simulation teaching method (SSTM) on nursing interns' learning outcomes, work capabilities and engagement in the respiratory department. Traditional simulation methods may lack realism and interactivity. Combining standardized patients with SSTM may provide a more immersive and effective teaching strategy. A randomized controlled trial. This randomized controlled trial compared the outcomes of traditional SSTM versus a combined standardized patient and SSTM approach. From April 2022 to April 2023, 108 nursing interns were randomly assigned to either a control group (traditional SSTM) or a research group (combined SSTM and standardized patients). Outcomes measured included theoretical and practical knowledge, self-directed learning, work engagement, caregiving skills, self-efficacy, stress levels and teaching evaluations. Nursing interns in the research group showed significant improvements in theoretical and practical knowledge, autonomous learning, work engagement, caregiving skills and self-efficacy, with a reduction in stress levels. Teaching evaluations rated the research group higher across multiple aspects. The integration of standardized patients with SSTM is an effective educational strategy that enhances learning outcomes, practical capabilities and motivation among nursing interns, offering a valuable approach for better preparing students for clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Complete mesocolic excision (CME) for right-sided colon cancer offers oncological advantages but remains technically demanding, which limits its widespread adoption. Understanding the learning curve (LC) for this complex procedure is essential to ensure safe implementation and to guide structured surgical training. This systematic review aims to evaluate the learning curve of minimally invasive CME for right-sided colon cancer, focusing on operative metrics and complications, and estimating the number of cases required to achieve proficiency. This systematic review adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024615748). A comprehensive search across six databases included studies utilizing CUSUM analysis to evaluate the LC of minimally invasive CME. Outcomes of interest included operative time, complications, pathological quality, and oncological metrics. Studies with fewer than ten cases or lacking LC focus were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I framework. Seven studies were included, comprising laparoscopic and robotic CME. Proficiency thresholds ranged from 21 to 32 cases, with consistent reductions in operative time across studies. Complication rates varied (3.6-13%) but remained within acceptable limits in most series. Lymph node harvest was adequate even during early phases, with minor variations between studies. Heterogeneity in study design and reporting limited meta-analysis but highlighted the utility of standardized CUSUM analysis for evaluating LCs. This review establishes a consistent proficiency plateau for minimally invasive CME at 21-32 cases, supporting its safety and efficacy even during initial phases. However, methodological variability and lack of standardized reporting underscore the need for further research and validated training programs to optimize outcomes and ensure broader adoption.",

    "abstract": "Attentional bias (AB), characterized by a disproportionate allocation of attention toward threat-related stimuli, constitutes a well-established cognitive mechanism underlying anxiety disorders. As a targeted intervention, attentional bias modification (ABM) has garnered substantial empirical support for its efficacy in attenuating AB and ameliorating anxiety symptomatology. This study evaluated and compared the effectiveness of three major ABM training paradigms in reducing attentional bias manifestations: dot-probe task-based ABM (DPT-ABM), emotional spatial cueing task-based ABM (ESCT-ABM), and visual search task-based ABM (VST-ABM). Using the attention to negative inventory (ANI) scale, we screened 202 non-clinical adolescents exhibiting elevated levels of negative attentional bias (NAB) and randomly assigned them to either an active modification group (DPT-ABM, ESCT-ABM, or VST-ABM) or a matched control group (DPT-C, ESCT-C, or VST-C). Participants underwent eight offline training sessions across a four-week period. Attentional bias scores (ABS), learning anxiety, and sense of agency (SoA) were assessed at pre-test and post-test intervals. Additionally, a three-month follow-up evaluation was conducted to examine long-term changes in ABS. The results showed that VST-ABM led to significant and sustained reductions in ABS compared to its control group, while other paradigms did not produce such effects. This study provides new evidence that active search training for positive emotional stimuli in VST-ABM is more effective than passive avoidance training of negative stimuli in reducing negative attentional bias and improving emotional well-being in non-clinical adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Haptic cueing to improve gait in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) is an emerging treatment approach of interest. This systematic review [PROSPERO CRD42023483230] aimed to critically appraise the available literature on the effectiveness of haptic cues on gait in people with PD. Articles published from inception to May 2025 were searched in EMBASE, MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Both randomized and non-randomized clinical trials that investigated the effects of haptic cues on gait parameters (stride length, gait velocity, cadence) in people with PD were included. Two reviewers independently selected articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias (ROB) using the Downs and Black tool. Twenty-nine studies, including 661 participants with PD, were included. Four studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with strong methodological quality, while the others were pre-post interventional studies. Three RCTs reported outcomes suitable for pooled analysis. Results indicate that haptic cueing improves gait (mainly velocity and stride length), with some improvements noted in additional spatiotemporal parameters and freezing of gait. Despite positive findings, evidence is limited and more robust RCTs are required to verify the efficacy of haptic cues, particularly for sustained effects on gait.",

    "title": "Comparing Peer vs. Near Peer Feedback in an At-Home Laparoscopic Curriculum.",
    "abstract": "Skilled faculty instructors for laparoscopy are limited. Previously we observed that learners give effective asynchronous feedback to their peers, on par with faculty. We hypothesize that senior resident near-peers can give superior feedback compared with peers by exhibiting advanced technical knowledge, while sharing educational benefits seen in peer feedback. Junior surgical residents completed a 9-stage curriculum of laparoscopic tasks, with videos uploaded to an online platform. In experimental design, residents were randomized for video review by peers (same level) or near-peers (PGY4). Performance assessed with a task-specific rubric and completion time on an in-person final assessment was compared with t-test. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with participants compared peer and near-peer feedback. A single academic institution with residency programs in 2 cities. Fifty-one invited PGY1-2 residents from 3 specialties (general surgery, OB-GYN, urology). Final assessment performance was similar among peer (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;10) and near-peer (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;7) cohorts as seen in mean (SD) total points (56 [5.5] and 60 [4.3], p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.160) or total (SD) time taken (1029 [289] and 887 [278] seconds, p&#x202f;=&#x202f;0.355) during the assessment. Interviews with 3 participants from the peer group and 5 from near-peer identified 3 major themes. First, different accountability mechanisms relate to assessor role, noting that participants were motivated to maintain reputation in front of their senior resident near-peers; in contrast, working with peers felt more collaborative and supportive. Second, participants noted they learn as they gave and received feedback, and evaluating one's peers provided a sense of community. Third, the value of the curriculum is largely in the curriculum design, including video examples or rubrics which standardize feedback regardless of assessor expertise. Social learning and the learning environment appeared stronger in the peer feedback group relative to the near-peer group. Additionally, no particular advantage was noted in feedback quality given by near-peers.",

    "abstract": "Observational learning is widely used in skill learning, with self-modeling (i.e., viewing oneself perform at a higher level than currently possessed) emerging as a promising method with potential direct effects through attention/information processes, as well as indirect motivational benefits. However, prior research has yielded mixed results regarding its effectiveness in children learning motor skills and whether its effects are direct, indirect, or both. This study compared the effects of self-modeling, self-observation (i.e., viewing oneself perform at the current level), peer-modeling (i.e., viewing a peer perform at a higher level than the learner), and a control group on front crawl learning and motivation in children aged 5-9&#xa0;years. The aim of this comparison was to disentangle the direct attentional/informational effects from the indirect motivational effects of self-modeling and observational learning on learning outcomes. Sixty-seven children participated in an eight-week intervention, randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Before practicing the front crawl, participants watched instruction videos featuring either themselves at the same skill level (i.e., self-observation), themselves at a higher skill level (i.e., self-modeling), a peer (i.e., peer-modeling), or a control video of Shrek (control). All three observational learning interventions led to significantly greater improvements in swimming time than the control group, in the absence of significant differences between the observational interventions. No significant differences were found in motivational beliefs between the four groups. Mediation analyses revealed significant direct effects of all three observational interventions on improvements in swimming time, with no evidence of indirect effects through motivational beliefs. It appears that, regardless of the model used, observational learning improves children's front crawl learning, but not their motivational beliefs. The effects of observational learning seem to be predominantly direct, enhancing attention and information processing.",

    "abstract": "A core element of EMDR therapy is that a patient recalls a traumatic memory while concurrently making horizontal eye movements. Experimental studies show that performing such tasks simultaneously (i.e., Recall&#xa0;+&#xa0;Dual-Task) reduces the memory's vividness and unpleasantness. Memory age may act as a boundary condition on this effect as older memories have been more consolidated and strengthened over time compared to more recently formed memories, making older memories less susceptible to change. To investigate this, participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;195) in Experiment 1 recalled an old or a new negative autobiographical memory and were randomly assigned to a Recall&#xa0;+&#xa0;Dual-Task intervention or a Recall Only intervention. Before, during, and after the intervention the memory was rated on vividness and unpleasantness. In Experiment 2 (N = 356) a follow-up rating was added one day later to test for delayed effects of memory age on intervention effectiveness. Collectively, the two experiments show that Recall&#xa0;+&#xa0;Dual-Task immediately reduces memory vividness and unpleasantness compared to Recall Only. For unpleasantness this differential effect remained one day later. However, none of the effects were moderated by memory age. Thus, these findings suggest that memory age is not a boundary condition for dual-task effectiveness and that dual-task interventions (as used in EMDR) could be similarly effective for reducing the intensity of emotional memories of different ages.",

Female participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;179), either using HCs (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;87) or naturally cycling (NC; N&#xa0;=&#xa0;92), were randomly assigned to one of three groups: no emotion regulation (control), distancing and immersion, or reinterpretation and immersion. The emotion regulation groups completed emotion regulation training in which they viewed emotional images while applying different emotion regulation strategies, followed by a surprise memory test. Overall, HC users showed greater emotional reactivity to emotional images compared to NC participants. Both HC and NC groups successfully applied emotion regulation strategies as measured by changes in emotional affect; however, distancing led to a greater reduction in negative emotions compared to reinterpretation, particularly among HC users. Both HC and NC groups showed better memory for positive images after applying immersion. For negative images, HC users showed reduced memory performance when applying either distancing or reinterpretation, an effect not observed in NC participants. These findings suggest that HC use may influence specific aspects of emotional processing and memory, highlighting the need for more nuanced research on the cognitive and emotional effects of hormonal contraceptives.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated use of retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) to strengthen inhibitory memories following exposures for individuals with fear of public speaking. RIF refers to the weakening of memories following recall of related memories. Participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;64) with elevated public speaking fear completed 16 public speaking exposures over two visits. Following each speech, participants noted one positive, inhibitory memory (i.e., absence of unconditional stimulus of rejection) and one negative, excitatory memory (i.e., unconditional stimulus of rejection). Participants randomly assigned to the Inhibitory condition rehearsed positive memories following a procedure designed to induce forgetting of negative memories from the same speeches, whereas participants in the Control condition rehearsed a mix of positive and negative memories. After the second visit, participants recalled as many exposure memories as possible. We hypothesized that RIF would occur in both conditions and that Inhibitory condition participants induced to forget negative memories would report a greater decrease in public speaking fear. In partial support of our hypotheses, we observed evidence of RIF only in the Inhibitory condition. We found no difference in change in public speaking fear between conditions, but participants who demonstrated more RIF reported a greater decrease in public speaking fear. This is the first study to demonstrate RIF of fear-related memories. Differences in RIF between conditions suggests that fear-related memories may be more susceptible to RIF than inhibitory memories. Strategies that adapt RIF paradigms or other strategies to increase forgetting of fear-related memories should be honed in the future to augment exposure.",

    "abstract": "Food cue reactivity shapes eating behavior and likely relates to weight and hunger states. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies, however, have yielded mixed results on the underlying neural correlates. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of weight and hunger on neural responses to food cues. We searched PubMed and Web of Science (2000-2022) for fMRI studies using visual food cues that reported participants' weight and hunger states (PROSPERO: CRD42022365310). The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools and fMRI reporting standards were used to assess the risk of bias. The coordinate-based meta-analysis was conducted using GingerALE. Of the 2451 screened articles, 50 were included in the systematic review (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;1402), and 45 in the meta-analysis (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;1162). Results are based on both whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Overall, food cues consistently activated reward, frontal, and visual brain areas, in both obesity and healthy-weight groups, though selective differences in activation strength were found. A higher-order contrast meta-analysis indicated higher activations in a parahippocampal region in obesity versus healthy weight, supported by one study. Stratified analyses indicated that during fasting, individuals with obesity showed reward area activation (16 studies, n&#x202f;=&#x202f;396), while healthy-weight individuals exhibited frontal activation (23 studies, n&#x202f;=&#x202f;429), however, higher-order contrast analyses between groups showed no significant differences.

Additional studies are needed to further clarify these neural differences.",

    "abstract": "Learning by updating expectancies for aversive events is a proposed mechanism of exposure therapy. Reward processes and positive emotions, such as relief, may be closely tied to this learning process, though this has not been explicitly studied in an exposure therapy setting. Participants were UCLA college students who completed two sessions of exposure to public speaking (16 exposures total) and three public speaking anxiety assessments (baseline, post-assessment, one-week follow-up). Additionally, participants completed rehearsal exercises after exposures and were randomized to one of two rehearsal conditions: positive rehearsal designed to enhance reward processes and positive emotions (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42), or neutral rehearsal (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;42). Self-reported expectancy for the feared outcome (e.g., social rejection) and relief that the expected feared outcome did not occur were measured across exposures using both observed and computational modeling indices. Public speaking anxiety decreased from baseline to follow-up, with no differences between groups. Observed expectancy ratings decreased across exposures at a faster rate for the neutral than the positive rehearsal group, with no group differences in computational modeling of learning rate. Observed relief ratings significantly decreased across exposures for the positive group only, with no group differences in computational modeling of relief rate. Faster expectancy-based learning rate and higher expectancy-based intercept at the first exposure of two exposure sessions predicted lower public speaking anxiety at follow-up. Higher intercept of relief at the first exposure of two exposure sessions, but not relief rate, also predicted lower public speaking anxiety at follow-up. Findings support learning via expectancy updating as an important process in exposure therapy and highlight a need for further study of relief during exposure.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of smoking cessation education and training on the learning outcomes of dental students. A thorough literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and APA PsycINFO databases, covering publications up to March 2025. The inclusion criteria comprised all randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, with the assessment of methodological quality performed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. The initial search identified 922 articles, from which 9 moderate-quality studies were ultimately included, comprising 3 randomized controlled trials and 6 quasi-experimental studies, involving a total of 498 dental students. The instructional methods employed encompassed lectures, collaborative learning, and blended learning approaches. Notably, all studies exhibiting large effect sizes utilized either collaborative or blended teaching strategies. Five studies demonstrated statistically significant enhancements in students' knowledge regarding smoking cessation (P &lt; .05), with 3 studies reporting large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 1.41-2.80). Four studies revealed that training significantly improved dental students' attitudes and motivation towards tobacco cessation (P &lt; .05), with 2 studies indicating large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.94-2.00). Five studies showed significant advancements in students' skills related to tobacco cessation counselling (TCC) behaviours, with 3 studies showing large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.95-2.50). Three studies indicated a significant increase in students' self-efficacy post-training, all of which demonstrated large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 1.41-2.00). Overall, smoking cessation training was determined to be positively effective in achieving the learning outcomes of undergraduate dental students. To optimize outcomes within time and resource limits, appropriate teaching methods are essential. Collaborative and blended learning strategies can boost classroom interaction and improve essential learning outcomes. However, further experimental research is necessary to ascertain the long-term effects of such training.",

This study examined the effects of a simple reminiscence-based intervention on different reminiscence functions in this population. 113 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;61) or control group (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;52). The experimental group received 16 reminiscence sessions over eight weeks. Assessments occurred pre-, post-intervention, and at follow-up.

Intervention effects were analyzed using 2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;3 mixed ANOVAs (group&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;time). The results showed significant improvements in adaptive reminiscence functions, including identity, problem-solving, and preparation for death, as well as in the prosocial functions of conversation and teaching/informing in the experimental group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that simple reminiscence can be an effective strategy for preserving and enhancing adaptive reminiscence functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Clinical Implications: This intervention can be integrated into routine care for individuals with cognitive impairment, helping maintain emotional-cognitive functioning and improve quality of life.",

Linear mixed models analyzed outcomes with flavor condition, sex, and their interaction as fixed effects, adjusting for flavor order. Participants (average age = 19.1 years, <i>SD</i> = 0.8; 52.5% female and 67.5% White) used e-cigarettes on average 6.2 (<i>SD</i> = 1.5) days/week. Participants reported marginally less liking of the overall vaping experience for the watermelon flavor with menthol (<i>M</i> = -3.92 [<i>SE</i> = 3.16]) compared to the watermelon flavor without menthol (<i>M</i> = 1.27 [SE = 3.16], <i>p</i> = .05). No main effects of flavor, sex, or their interactions were observed in sensory and reward effects (<i>p</i>s &gt; .05). Among our sample of young adult e-cigarette users, adding a cooling component to a sweet-flavored e-liquid did not result in altered liking, sensory, or reward effects compared to sweet-flavored e-liquid without cooling.

    "abstract": "Physically active learning and quality physical education can be an opportunity to increase physical activity and encourage its practice. Therefore, the study purpose was to analyze the effect of a classroom-based physical activity intervention on children's physical literacy, movement behavior and cognitive performance. Randomized control trial (with retention) and multilevel linear model analysis. The Active Learning in Physical Literacy Study was conducted in Valencia (Spain) and involved 332 fifth grade students (10-11&#x202f;years) from six primary schools (three experimental and three control). The intervention, registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (number NCT05812118), lasted 9-10&#x202f;weeks and consisted of the implementation of three physically active learning activities for at least 30 min in combination with physical education lessons each day. The outcomes of the intervention were within movement behavior: moderate to vigorous physical activity; within physical literacy: perceived physical literacy, social support for physical activity, actual and perceived motor competence; and within cognitive performance: math fluency and teachers' proxy-report of math performance. A significant interaction effect (group per time) on moderate to vigorous physical activity, actual motor competence, math fluency and teachers' proxy-report of math performance was found. No interaction effect was found in the psychosocial domain (perceived motor competence and physical literacy, and parent and peer support for physical activity). The Active Learning in Physical Literacy intervention was effective in enhancing movement behavior and cognitive performance. Therefore, movement-centered pedagogy enables the integration of physical activity with learning, which in turn contributes to improving elements of children's physical literacy.",

    "abstract": "It is fundamental for patient safety that medical devices are correctly and competently applied. Shift work, especially in anaesthesia, poses challenges to provide timely comprehensive learning opportunities. Because personnel shortages encourage cuts to staff education, self-directed learning might alleviate these difficulties. We conducted a single-centre, noninferiority, randomised, controlled trial in a large university-based anaesthesia department. Anaesthesia nurses and physicians were randomly assigned 1:1 to self-directed learning including a learning video (intervention) or to an instructor-led workshop (control). Both groups attended a 1-h teaching session on a new anaesthesia workstation. Around 3 months later, participants from both groups were assessed on 12 competences at an examination station. The defined primary outcome was the difference in success rates between groups. We hypothesised that the success rate of self-directed learning would be noninferior to instructor-led learning by a noninferiority margin of &#x394;=10%. Data from 222 participants (97 anaesthesia nurses, 125 physicians) were analysed. Participants were aged between 32 and 44 yr; 35.6% had &lt;5 yr of professional experience. The success rate difference between both groups was -0.9% (90% confidence interval: -3.8%-1.7%), confirming the noninferiority of self-directed learning. Creating an educational video for the self-directed acquisition of necessary knowledge and skills to handle an anaesthesia workstation requires initial investment, but reduces substantially instructor time, as learners can study independently according to their needs. Video-supported self-directed learning of the handling of an anaesthesia workstation was not inferior to traditional teacher-led instruction. ClinicalTrials.gov(NCT05530382).",

    "title": "Should medical teachers spend more time modelling or coaching students? A dual eye-tracking and randomised controlled study on peer instruction in sonography.",
    "abstract": "When first introducing medical procedures, instructors must decide how much of their limited time must be allocated between modelling (demonstrate and explain) and coaching (scaffold and support) students. Given the time constraints in clinical routine, it is currently unknown which relative proportion of modelling versus coaching is more efficient for procedural learning. We randomly assigned 73 students without prior knowledge to either an extended modelling (EM) or an extended coaching (EC) group for an emergency sonography training. In the EM group, medical teachers demonstrated a routine examination explaining their thought process, while also providing some coaching. In the EC group, students trained more independently with consistent teacher support, with less emphasis on modelling. We used dual mobile eye-tracking and voice recording to objectify the teacher-student interactions and applied a comprehensive assessment to understand which learning domains improved under which condition. On post-tests, the EC group outperformed the EM group by 12% in interpreting dynamic sonographic imagery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014). They completed the ultrasound examinations 7% faster (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.050). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in interpreting static sonographic imagery (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.322) nor in practical scores (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.062). Contrary to expectations, there were no differences between the groups in terms of eye movement metrics that explained the performance effects. However, two behavioural variables were positively related with learning outcomes across both groups: the percentage of joint visual attention between teacher and student (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.316, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and the number of words spoken during the training (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.175, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). This study provides empirical evidence that EC may be particularly effective when introducing new procedural medical skills. In learning complex procedures, direct sensorimotor experience with guided support appears more advantageous than extended observation. These findings suggest that medical educators should give students more opportunities for supervised hands-on practice rather than relying primarily on demonstration-based teaching.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise may enhance cognitive functions, including inhibitory control. Despite increasing evidence, there remains a need for robust evidence on long-term interventions targeting inhibition in healthy, sedentary young adults. We investigated the effects of a 12-wk cardiovascular exercise program on this population's behavioral and neuroelectric measures of inhibitory control. Sedentary young adults were randomized into an experimental group ( n = 32) or a passive control group ( n = 30). The experimental group completed a cycling ergometer program consisting of 6 wk of moderate-intensity continuous exercise, followed by 6 wk of moderate- to high-intensity interval exercise. Inhibitory control was assessed at baseline (pretest), after 6 wk (midtest), and after the intervention (posttest) using a modified flanker task with EEG recordings. Assessed outcomes included response time (RT) and event-related potentials (the amplitude and latency of the N2 and P3b components). The experimental group exhibited a progressive reduction in RT for incongruent trials across all time points (pretest to midtest, midtest to posttest, and pretest to posttest) without compromising accuracy. The control group showed RT reductions only from pretest to posttest, with a decline in overall accuracy. Neuroelectric analyses revealed decreased N2 amplitudes and faster P3b latencies in the experimental group from midtest to posttest during incongruent trials. The control group demonstrated increased N2 amplitudes from pretest to midtest and pretest to posttest during congruent trials. A 12-wk cardiovascular exercise intervention combining moderate-intensity continuous exercise and moderate- to high-intensity interval exercise enhances both behavioral and neuroelectric indices of inhibitory control in sedentary young adults. These findings highlight the potential of exercise programs as an accessible and effective strategy for improving cognitive health, especially in healthy but sedentary adults.",

The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Instructional videos are commonly employed in physical education (PE) to boost motor skills and motivation. However, their transient nature often hampers their effectiveness. This study delves into how video modality and user control affect learning basketball tactics. Eighty third-year students (<i>M</i><sub><i>age</i></sub> = 16.13 years old, <i>SD</i> = 0.62) take part in this study. Participants were randomly placed into four groups: \"video + audio without control\", \"video + text without control\", \"video + audio with control\", and \"video + text with control\". After the intervention, students were assessed through recall and transfer tests. The results highlighted that the students performed significantly better in conditions where they had control over the video. Interestingly, the \"video + text with control\" group outperformed the \"video + audio with control\" group. This outcome suggests a reverse modality effect, challenging the traditional preference for audio over text in instructional videos. These results imply that giving learners control is beneficial, especially for novices dealing with complex dynamic visualizations. However, they also advise caution in choosing the modality, as the effectiveness can vary depending on the nature of the content and the learner's control over it.",

    "abstract": "Chronic widespread pain (CWP)-as in many other clinical presentations-manifests in ongoing pain without identifiable structural cause, with pain that spreads over multiple body areas. The development and maintenance of symptoms may involve learning mechanisms. Ninety-four healthy volunteers participated in this study and were randomly distributed to 4 groups. In the classical conditioning combined with the verbal suggestion group, US- (small pain distribution) and US+ (large pain distribution) were paired with visual stimuli (CS+ and CS-), and participants were told about this association. In the verbal suggestion group, the conditioning was not performed, whereas in the classical conditioning-only group, learning was not combined with suggestion. In the control group, conditioning and suggestion did not take place. Ratings of perceived pain distribution were collected after each trial and ratings of pain intensity after each block of trials. During the testing phase, participants were exposed to electrocutaneous stimuli corresponding to only the small (US-) pain distribution. The results showed significant differences between CS+ and CS- pain distribution ratings across the experimental groups: conditioning + verbal suggestion ( P &lt; 0.01), conditioning-only group ( P &lt; 0.05), and verbal suggestion-only group ( P &lt; 0.05), but not in the control group ( P &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, significant differences in the perceived pain distribution were found between the control group and all experimental groups. This result supports our main hypothesis that the perceived pain distribution can be influenced by classical conditioning as well as verbal suggestion, although the effect is stronger when both are combined.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with available treatments often showing limited efficacy. Recent research suggests that targeting specific subtypes of depression and understanding the underlying brain mechanisms can improve treatment outcomes. This study investigates the potential of the potassium KCNQ (Kv7) channel opener ezogabine to modulate the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the brain's reward circuitry and alleviate depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, a core feature of MDD. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with MDD ages 18 to 65 years compared daily dosing with ezogabine (n= 19) with placebo (n = 21) for 5 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed RSFC of the brain's key reward regions (ventral caudate, nucleus accumbens) at baseline and posttreatment. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Montgomery-&#xc5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and other clinical symptom scales. Ezogabine significantly reduced RSFC between the reward seeds and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus compared with placebo, which was associated with a reduction in depression severity. Improvements in anhedonia (SHAPS) and depressive symptoms (MADRS) with ezogabine compared with placebo were also associated with decreased connectivity between the reward seeds and mid/posterior cingulate regions (midcingulate cortex, PCC, precuneus). The findings suggest that ezogabine's antidepressant effects are mediated through modulation of striatal-mid/posterior cingulate connectivity, indicating a potential therapeutic mechanism for KCNQ-targeted drugs for MDD and anhedonia. Future studies should validate these results in larger trials.",

Gamification and Flipped Classroom (FC) literature expresses a clear need for a theoretical foundation that positively affects motivation, behavioral change, and learning. However, this requires an overview of the current theoretical foundations of GFC research. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic mixed studies review (SMSR) of the current theoretical foundations of GFC research and learning effects. Sixty-nine studies were identified after applying rigorously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review revealed that a significant number of studies (25 of 69) lacked a theoretical foundation. In studies supported by theory, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) was most frequently employed. Moreover, only three studies used theories to design both gamification and FC components. While GFC research generally shows positive effects on learning, studies with a theoretical background reported a higher rate of positive GFC outcomes (56%), compared to only 29% for studies lacking a theoretical foundation. Future research should explore and attempt to link SDT and other theories to learning impacts.",

We partly randomized student assignments to three schematic conditions: (a) diagrams with simultaneous arrows, (b) diagrams with sequential-transient arrows, or (c) diagrams with sequential-permanent arrows. Each of 45 participants attended a morning session (08h00-09h00) and an afternoon session (16h00-17h00) on two different days. Each session involved oral temperature and mood state measurements, a study phase (in which the participant studied how the play system functioned), and then a recall-reconstruction task. We found that morning sessions were associated with better recall performance than late afternoon sessions, regardless of the schematic diagram format. Moreover, students derived greater benefit from diagrams featuring both sequential-transient and sequential-permanent arrows in both morning and afternoon sessions, with a clear relative advantage for the diagrams with sequential-permanent arrows. During morning sessions, compared to afternoon sessions, participants showed lower oral temperature, lower negative mood, and higher positive mood. We discuss these findings and their implications for the acquisition of tactical information about soccer.",

    "abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgery has transformed minimally invasive procedures by enhancing precision, dexterity, and visualization. However, it presents unique psychomotor and cognitive challenges that traditional surgical training often fails to address. Simulation-based platforms such as the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS) and SimNow are widely implemented, yet a universally accepted standard for assessing robotic surgical proficiency remains elusive. Commonly used evaluation tools-GEARS, OSATS, and expert assessments-vary in standardization and applicability. To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize current evidence on simulation-based robotic surgical training in trainees, focusing on proficiency assessment tools, learning curve thresholds, and skill transfer from conventional surgical techniques. A systematic search of five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) was performed up to June 2025. Eligible studies included trainee populations assessed using validated robotic simulators or evaluation metrics. Data extraction followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis. Fourteen studies including 652 surgical trainees met the inclusion criteria. Simulation-based training significantly improved performance on GEARS (SMD 1.22, 95% CI 0.96-1.49) and OSATS (SMD 1.08, 95% CI 0.82-1.34). Task completion times (SMD -0.95) and error rates (SMD-1.03) also improved markedly. Learning curve analyses revealed performance plateaus between 15 and 35 sessions (median: 22). Subgroup analyses showed comparable efficacy between dVSS and SimNow simulators. Skill transfer from laparoscopic surgery showed a moderate effect (SMD&#x2009;~&#x2009;0.40), while no significant benefit was observed from open surgical experience. The integration of expert-defined proficiency thresholds and real-time feedback accelerated skill acquisition and improved self-efficacy scores. Simulation-based training significantly enhances robotic surgical proficiency, especially when integrated with validated metrics and expert feedback. A competency-based framework incorporating performance analytics and learning curve insights is essential for effective training. Future research should prioritize AI-enhanced, personalized training platforms and long-term validation of simulator-acquired skills in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a self-perceived cognitive complaint in the absence of objective impairment, representing an at-risk state along the continuum of cognitive aging. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) has shown cognitive benefits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its effects on cognitive functions in SCD remain largely unexplored. To evaluate the effects of 10-Hz rTMS over the L-DLPFC in individuals with SCD on cognitive functions and long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity, indexed by changes in motor evoked potential (MEP) following intermittent theta burst stimulation, and examine the relationship between brain plasticity and cognitive outcomes. In this randomized, sham-controlled trial, 42 individuals with SCD received 20 sessions of either active or sham 10-Hz rTMS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21 per group) over four weeks. The primary outcome was delayed episodic memory, evaluated using the Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H). Secondary outcomes included additional cognitive measures and MEP amplitudes at baseline and at 5 (T<sub>5</sub>), 10 (T<sub>10</sub>), and 30 (T<sub>30</sub>) minutes post-intervention. The rTMS group exhibited significant improvements in both delayed episodic memory (AVLT-N5) and MEP amplitudes at T<sub>5</sub> and T<sub>10</sub> following the intervention, whereas such changes were not observed in the sham group. Moreover, increased MEP amplitude at T<sub>10</sub> was positively correlated with improved AVLT-N5 performance. These findings provide the first evidence for enhanced delayed episodic memory and LTP-like plasticity in individuals with SCD following 10-Hz rTMS over the L-DLPFC, suggesting a potential role of LTP-like plasticity in elucidating the neurophysiological correlates of cognitive improvements for SCD.

    "abstract": "Contemporary society faces significant challenges that can lead to stress-induced tunnel vision. Positive affect can counteract these effects by expanding humans' attentional scope, potentially promoting resilience and creativity. This preregistered triple-blind study investigated the role of endogenous opioids in mediating attentional broadening following reward receipt. Using a placebo-controlled crossover design, 40 volunteers underwent two sessions separated by at least 1&#xa0;week, receiving either 50&#xa0;mg of naltrexone or a placebo. Participants completed a Navon letters task designed to contrast the effects of reward receipt versus reward anticipation on attentional scope. As predicted, our results show that the attentional broadening observed after reward receipt under placebo was eliminated when opioid receptors were blocked. Naltrexone did not result in blunted reward anticipation effects on task performance or attentional narrowing. This study highlights the role of endogenous opioids in attentional breadth and their potential for cognitive flexibility and resilience through natural positive experiences, with potential implications for mental health and stress management.",

    "abstract": "The learning curve for endoscopic diagnosis varies, and an optimal educational strategy is not available. Working memory (WM) refers to an individual's ability to store and process information quickly and simultaneously. This study aimed to determine whether educational methods, optimized by individual WM, facilitate learning about endoscopic diagnoses. In the development phase, the standard WM profile for general endoscopists was determined by 79 endoscopists. In the validation phase, 60 trainees from four Japanese institutions were assessed for visuospatial or verbal WM dominance, based on the standard WM profile, and randomly assigned to receive matched (Matched-E group) or unmatched (Unmatched-E group) education. In the Matched-E group, the visuospatial and verbal WM-dominant trainees learned the endoscopic diagnosis of colorectal polyps by pattern recognition and through the description text of narrow-band imaging classification, respectively. In the Unmatched-E group, participants received education that was opposite to their dominant WM type. The diagnostic accuracy of the endoscopic diagnosis of colorectal polyps was compared between the groups after each educational session. Among the 60 trainees, 40 (21 in Matched-E and 19 in Unmatched-E) completed the validation test. The diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher in the Matched-E group than that in the Unmatched-E group (61.6% vs. 53.9%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). The diagnostic accuracy for non-neoplastic lesions was higher in the Matched-E group than that in the Unmatched-E group (68.0% vs. 48.4%, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002), whereas it did not differ for adenoma, intramucosal cancer, or invasive cancer.

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Soy foods and isoflavones are inversely associated with cognitive decline; however, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show mixed results. Fermented soy contains bioactive compounds not found in unfermented soybeans, such as peptides and aglycone isoflavones, which may support cognition by reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Fermented soy RCTs on older adults with mild cognitive impairment show cognitive benefits; however, the effects of fermented soy on cognitively healthy older adults are not known. <b>Methods</b>: We investigated the effects of a non-probiotic fermented soy powder, added to the usual diet, compared to a placebo matched for energy on global cognition, memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive function in a 12-week RCT on 61 adults aged 65 years and older (74 &#xb1; 5 y; 47 completers). <b>Results</b>: The fermented soy group showed significant improvement (<i>p</i> = 0.041) in memory scores (1.81%, 95% CI: -2.10, 5.72) vs. placebo (1.16%, 95% CI: -3.64, 5.97) using analysis of variance, adjusted for sex and baseline scores. Post hoc analyses on women 70 years and older (<i>n</i> = 29) found significant improvement in global cognition (<i>p</i> = 0.028) and memory (<i>p</i> = 0.049) in the fermented soy group. Global cognition mean change adjusted for baseline scores was 2.86% (95% CI: 1.52, 4.21) for fermented soy and 0.06% (95% CI: -1.43, 1.55) for placebo. Memory mean change adjusted for baseline scores was 8.47% (95% CI: 5.05, 11.89) in the fermented soy group, compared to 2.05% (95% CI: -1.75, 5.84) for placebo. <b>Conclusions</b>: These outcomes suggest that fermented soy has the potential to slow age-related cognitive decline, especially memory for women 70 and older. Further research to confirm these findings in older women, and in males and other age categories is warranted.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the YCMAP intervention (Youth Culturally Adapted Manual Assisted Problem Solving) for adolescents after self-harm in Pakistan. Multicentre, randomised controlled trial that compared YCMAP with enhanced treatment as usual. General practices, emergency departments, medical wards of participating hospitals, and community centres across Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Multan, and Rawalpindi. Adolescents with a recent history of self-harm identified at participating health centres by treating physicians between 5 November 2019 and 31 August 2021. The YCMAP group received up to 10 treatment sessions over three months; the intervention was based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy. The primary outcome was the repetition of self-harm at 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes were distress, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and health related quality of life at three, six, nine, and 12 months after randomisation. Participants' satisfaction with the services was assessed at three and 12 months after randomisation. This trial was conducted between November 2019 and February 2023 and included 684 adolescents randomised to YCMAP (n=342) or enhanced treatment as usual (n=342). The YCMAP group had a significantly lower risk of self-harm repetition than the enhanced treatment as usual group at 12 months after randomisation (odds ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.70, P=0.006). YCMAP participants showed a statistically significant reduction in distress, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation at three months, but these differences were not statistically significant at 12 months. YCMAP participants also reported significantly better quality of life and satisfaction with services at three months, with these effects sustained at all follow-up points. The YCMAP intervention was shown to be beneficial in self-harm prevention among adolescents. Further research and replication of findings in diverse settings are recommended to strengthen the evidence base for this public health intervention.

    "title": "Investigating Learning Effects Through the Implementation of Teledermatology Consultations Among General Practitioners in Germany: Mixed Methods Process Evaluation.",
    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of dermatological diseases will pose a growing challenge to the health care system and, in particular, to general practitioners (GPs) as the first point of contact for these patients. In many countries, primary care physicians are supported by teledermatology services. The aim of this study was to detect learning effects and gains among GPs through teledermatology consultations (TCs) in daily practice. As part of a mixed methods study embedded in a cluster-randomized controlled trial (TeleDerm), a full survey and semiguided face-to-face interviews were conducted among GPs of participating intervention practices using the telemedicine approach. A TC assessment tool (TC-AT) was developed to evaluate the quality of clinical data and images of TCs conducted during the run-in and intervention phases, with a score ranging from 0 (lowest quality) to 10 (highest quality). Mixed methods analysis triangulated qualitative content analysis, survey data with a growth curve model calculated from TC-AT data, comparing subjective experiences of GPs with objective process data. A total of 487 TCs of 33 practices were analyzed. Questionnaires from n=46 GPs (practice-level response rate: 69.9%) were included in the quantitative analysis. Two-thirds of the GPs (n=31; 67.4%) in the written survey rated the TCs as helpful for differential diagnosis and treatment management. Improved self-reported confidence in diagnosing skin diseases due to the timely clinical feedback from dermatologists was reported by more than half of the responding GPs (n=25; 54.3%). In the interviews (n=13), teleconsultations were mainly seen as a learning opportunity by the GPs. Regarding the quality of TCs, a mean TC-AT score of 7.4 (SD 1.7, range 0-10) was observed. In the growth curve model, a simple linear time trend provided the best fit to the TC-AT score trajectory across the observed study period. A significant time * TC-AT start score interaction was found (F452=30.66, P&lt;.001). While regardless of the initial TC-AT score, repeated TCs lead to process quality improvements over time, post hoc probing of the TC-AT start score as a moderator of the learning effect over time revealed the highest improvements among GP practices with a lower initial TC-AT score (-1 SD: standardized slope=0.59, P&lt;.001; mean: standardized slope=0.38, P&lt;.001; +1 SD: standardized slope=0.18, P&lt;.001). TCs have been shown to be an effective method of education for GPs in terms of \"learning on the job\" in daily practice. The telemedicine approach seems to be an easily implementable and effective tool to support continuing medical education in the field of dermatology. Strategies could be developed to train GPs and medical students in the use of TC to adequately prepare them for the increasing technological demands of their future profession in primary care.",

    "abstract": "Reward processing involves several components, including reward anticipation, cost-effort computation, reward consumption, reward sensitivity, and reward learning. Recent research has highlighted the cerebellum's role in reward processing. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cerebellar stimulation on reward processing using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). In this single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study, 63 healthy adults received either active (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;31) or sham (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;32) 1.7&#xa0;mA HD-tDCS targeting the right posterior cerebellum for 20 minutes. Reward processing was assessed before and after stimulation using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task, the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards (EEfRT-Adaptive) Task, and the Probabilistic Stimulus Selection Task (PST). Results showed that the active stimulation group preserved anticipatory and consummatory pleasure in response to high rewards in the MID task, whereas the sham group exhibited a decline in these measures from pre-test to post-test. The active stimulation group had enhanced reward sensitivity in the EEfRT-adaptive task. HD-tDCS appeared to influence the reward learning rate in the PST, although this effect was moderated by participants' emotional state. Our study provides preliminary evidence that HD-tDCS targeting the cerebellum can effectively modulate multiple facets of reward processing. Cerebellar stimulation may have therapeutic potential for psychiatric patients with impaired reward processing.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of robotic pancreatectomy has grown significantly in recent years, driven by its potential advantages in precision, minimally invasive access, and improved patient recovery. However, mastering these complex procedures requires overcoming a substantial learning curve, and the role of structured mentoring in facilitating this transition remains underexplored. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the number of cases required to achieve surgical proficiency, assess the impact of mentoring on skill acquisition, and analyze how outcomes evolve throughout the learning process. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a thorough literature search across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, encompassing studies published from the inception of robotic pancreatic surgery up to 2025. We included studies that explicitly reported on learning curves, mentoring interventions, or skill progression in robotic pancreatic resections. Meta-analytical methods were employed to synthesize data on operative time, intraoperative blood loss, conversion rates, and postoperative complications. After screening 1,234 records, 25 studies met our inclusion criteria. Our findings indicate that achieving proficiency in robotic distal pancreatectomy typically requires 20-30 cases, with operative time stabilizing around 180&#xa0;min beyond this threshold. In contrast, robotic pancreatoduodenectomy, being more technically demanding, necessitated 40-60 cases before surgeons reached consistent performance levels. Notably, surgeons who underwent formal mentoring programs demonstrated a shortened learning curve, requiring approximately 10-15 fewer cases to achieve comparable outcomes. Furthermore, mentored surgeons exhibited significantly lower complication rates (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85) and reduced operative times (mean difference&#x2009;-&#x2009;45&#xa0;min, 95% CI&#x2009;-&#x2009;60 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;30).These results underscore the importance of structured training and mentorship in robotic pancreatic surgery. The integration of standardized learning pathways, simulation-based training, and proctored early cases may optimize skill acquisition and improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on defining universal benchmarks for proficiency and evaluating long-term benefits of mentorship programs.",

Despite efforts to counteract such neural alterations, brain-based interventions for this disorder remain ineffective. In this sham-controlled randomized study, we report the initial results on the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulus (TMS) in normalizing reward functioning in this population. During a reward-based choice task, we applied robot-assisted 10-Hz TMS to the prefrontal cortex in OU (Active&#x2009;=&#x2009;16, Sham&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) and matched healthy controls (HC, Active&#x2009;=&#x2009;22, Sham&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) while we recorded the reward positivity - an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the anterior midcingulate cortex (MCC) to rewards. A robotic arm positioned a TMS coil over a prefrontal cortex target, and 50 pulses were delivered at 10-Hz before every 10 trials (2000 pulses, 400 trials). Our results revealed an interaction between TMS (Active vs Sham) and Group (OU vs HC) (F<sub>1,72</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.9, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01, &#x3b7;<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09).

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA&#x202f;: Included studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SP+CBL (experimental group) with lecture-based learning (LBL) (control group) among Chinese medical students and resident physicians, with outcomes including teaching satisfaction, theoretical knowledge scores and clinical practice performance. Non-English/non-Chinese studies, non-RCTs, duplicate publications, studies with incomplete data or irrelevant topics were excluded. Two researchers (JS/XC) independently screened records. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (ZZ). Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2.0 tool (ROB 2.0). Meta-analysis used Stata V.17.0. A random effects (RE) model was prespecified due to anticipated heterogeneity, final model selection RE or fixed effects was based on I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Evidence profiles were generated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Subgroup analyses compared theoretical/clinical outcomes between medical students and resident physicians to explore heterogeneity sources. A meta-analysis of 31 RCTs (n=2674), SP+CBL pedagogy outperformed traditional methods in three domains. Teaching satisfaction showed substantial improvement (OR 7.19, 95% CI 3.80 to 13.60, p&lt;0.001; moderate GRADE evidence). Theoretical knowledge achievements increased significantly (MD 5.91, 95% CI 4.63 to 7.18, p&lt;0.001; low GRADE evidence due to inconsistency). Clinical practice performance also improved significantly (MD=7.62, 95% CI 6.16 to 9.08, p&lt;0.001; low GRADE evidence from inconsistency). All findings remained robust in sensitivity analyses. Further subgroup analyses revealed that the improvement in theoretical knowledge scores was more pronounced among medical students, while the enhancement in clinical performance was more significant among resident physicians. Despite some high outcomes heterogeneity stemming from unavoidable methodological constraints in education, our meta-analysis and systematic review of eligible literature demonstrate that integrating SP and CBL facilitates students and resident physicians in acquiring theoretical knowledge and practical skills. It also boosts teaching satisfaction and positively impacts Chinese clinical education. INPLASY202560118.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of peer-assisted learning (PAL) and traditional teaching methods on the theoretical knowledge and practical skill education in clinical medicine by summarizing the relevant randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies reported to date. A comprehensive search was conducted across several medical literature databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Springer, Ovid, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Biology Medicine Disc (CBMdisc). All pertinent articles, reviews, and references published from January 1970 to May 2023 were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 software. A total of 81 RCTs were included in this analysis. The findings indicated that PAL surpassed traditional teaching methods in enhancing the transfer of theoretical knowledge and the acquisition of practical skills, especially in terms of student satisfaction and acceptance. It was also observed that, although PAL displayed advantages in certain areas, its effectiveness might not be substantial in fields demanding high levels of specialized knowledge. Furthermore, the reliability of the findings could be constrained by small sample sizes and inadequate implementation of blinding methods. Consequently, it is concluded that PAL is an effective and promising teaching method. Nonetheless, more rigorous research is required in the future to comprehensively explore the role of PAL in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Smooth social interactions rely on children's abilities to decode others' social signals, which includes what an individual may say or do, and their facial emotional expressions. Failure can lead to exclusion from social groups. Consequently, a number of social and emotional learning (SEL) training programmes have been developed, with some evidence of positive impacts on those skills themselves and on academic achievement. Here, we present and evaluate the efficacy of a novel classroom-based computerized learning activity, called SEE+ (Socio-emotional engagement through observation), in supporting and enhancing 7- to 10-year-olds' emotion recognition and theory of mind judgements through observation and inference. SEE+ involved observing four virtual characters interacting within social scenarios and inferring their mental states. Participants were recruited from across diverse school settings (rural, urban) in England as part of a large-scale randomised controlled trial (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5585; 7.3-11.0 years old, M age&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.1, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.0) resulting in a mix of socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Mixed model ANOVAs were used to compare performance on socio-emotional tasks between the SEE+ group, an active control group and a teaching-as-usual control group. SEE&#x2009;+&#x2009;was associated with the equivalent of 4-6 months improvement in performance on the socio-emotional assessment tasks. Children showed near transfer effects of the intervention (i.e., when characters present in the computerized learning activity were used in the assessment), while no strong evidence of far transfer effects (i.e., when photographs of unknown children were used in the assessment) was found. Limitations were the use of pen-and-paper assessments with a reduced number of trials, and a possible ceiling effect in the older children in the photograph condition. Our findings point to the relative plasticity of younger children's socio-emotional cognition and underscore SEE+ as an easy-to-use cost-effective socio-emotional resource for teachers to embed SEL in the school curriculum.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized shared-design tourniquet features have useful first-use learning when knowledge-of-results occurs. In a prior study, after watching training videos, 64 volunteers were videoed applying (Latin squares randomization): Combat Application Tourniquet Generation 7 &#x2122; (CAT7), SOF &#x2122; Tactical Tourniquet-Wide Generation 3 (SOFTTW3), SOF&#x2122; Tactical Tourniquet-Wide Generation 5 (SOFTTW5), Tactical Mechanical Tourniquet&#xae; (TMT), OMNA Marine Tourniquet&#x2122; (OMT), X8T-Tourniquet (X8T), Tactical Ratcheting Medical Tourniquet&#x2122; (Tac RMT), and RapidStop&#xae; Tourniquet (RST). Tourniquets were applied to live thighs with audible distal Doppler pulses. This study subset was 10 experienced and 33 no-experience appliers. Experienced appliers had fewer strap/redirect and fewer tightening-system understanding problems and faster associated times than no-experience appliers. Among no-experience appliers, firstuse learning was supported by faster \"Go\" to \"strap secured\" times for combined seventh and eighth versus first applications (p=.008), secondversus first-encounter CAT7/OMT applications (p=.0005), and secondversus first-encounter SOFTTW3/ SOFTTW5 applications (p=.079). Occlusion at \"Done\" was more frequent with experienced appliers (p=.006) and did not show first-use learning across all tourniquets in no-experience appliers. Occlusion at \"Done\" indicated possible first-use learning with ratcheting-buckle versus windlass-rod tightening systems (p=.028, no-experience appliers). Hook-and-loop strap security, which provides no inherent knowledge-of-results, showed no learning in experienced (five problem applications by two appliers) or no-experience appliers (29 problem applications by 18 appliers). Knowledge-of-results is critical for, but does not guarantee, tourniquet-application-useful first-use learning. The existence of first-use learning can allow limited experience with one tourniquet to improve performance with a different tourniquet with shared-design features. Therefore, exposure to different designs may have value, and providing tourniquet-training knowledge-of-results is important.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the impact of high-altitude hypoxia on multidimensional cognitive functions, considering moderating variables such as altitude, exposure time, cognitive domain, and experimental design. A three-level meta-analysis was conducted on 59 studies (1966-2024) comprising 739 effect sizes. Studies were screened and coded according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Cognitive tasks were categorized into seven domains: executive control, working memory, long-term memory, perceptual ability, psychomotor skill, attention, and others. Hedges' g was used as the effect size measure, and multilevel modeling was applied to account for dependent effect sizes. High-altitude hypoxia significantly impaired overall cognitive function (g = -0.424, p &lt; 0.001). Long-term memory and perceptual functions were most affected, followed by executive control, attention, and psychomotor skills; working memory was least impacted. Cognitive impairment was significant at altitudes above 2500 m. Acute (&lt;&#xa0;3 days) and chronic (&gt;&#xa0;30 days) exposure significantly affected cognition, while intermediate exposures (3-30 days) did not. Subgroup analyses revealed varying sensitivity across cognitive domains to altitude and exposure duration. High-altitude hypoxia adversely affects cognitive function, with severity varying by cognitive domain, altitude, and exposure duration. These findings highlight the need for tailored interventions and further research into acclimatization and de-acclimatization processes.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive comparison and evaluation of the effects of team-based learning (TBL) and lecture-based learning (LBL) in clinical medical education (CME) was conducted. A thorough search was carried out over PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for publications about the utilisation of TBL and LBL in clinical medicine. The search was performed until 20 September 2023. After the initial screening of the literature, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracting data and evaluating the methodological quality, a meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software and Stata 17.0 software. Thereby, nine studies were included. TBL was superior to LBL in total scores (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.19~1.48, p = 0.012), with significant differences in short-term theoretical scores (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.22~0.70, p &lt;0.001), practice scores (SMD = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.17~1.58, p = 0.015), student satisfaction (SMD = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.97~1.29, p &lt;0.001), and long-term theoretical scores (SMD = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.73~1.51, p &lt;0.001). The TBL teaching model appears to be superior to the LBL teaching model in all aspects of clinical medicine education, including total scores, short-term theoretical scores, practice scores, long-term theoretical scores, and student satisfaction. However, these findings need further confirmation from high-quality studies. Key Words: Team-based learning, Clinical medicine, Lecture-based learning.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of 12-week interventions on cognitive and physical fitness adaptations in older men with cognitive decline. We employed a randomized, parallel, and controlled design with five groups: team sports (TS), team sports with cognitive training (TS+C), aerobic exercise (A), aerobic exercise with cognitive training (A+C), and a control group (Control). Fifty older male volunteers (mean age: 69.3 &#xb1; 3.2 years) were included in the analysis. Interventions consisted of two 60-minute sessions per week for 12 weeks. Both TS and A groups participated in structured physical training, with TS involving 5v5 handball and football games, and A focusing on circuit training exercises. The TS+C and A+C groups additionally incorporated 20-minute cognitive training sessions using a software, targeting memory, attention, and executive functions. The control group maintained their usual routines. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physical fitness was assessed through six tests of the Senior Fitness Test. Results revealed significant post-intervention differences in MoCA (p &lt; 0.001, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup> = 0.622), chair stand (p = 0.038, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup> = 0.189), up and go (p &lt; 0.001, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup> = 0.516), and 6-minute walk test (p = 0.001, &#x3b7;p<sup>2</sup> = 0.333) scores among groups. Post hoc analysis showed that TS, TS+C, A, and A+C groups significantly improved in MoCA, chair stand, up and go, and 6-minute walk test compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were observed for arm curl, sit and reach, or back scratch tests. Our findings suggest that 12-week interventions incorporating team sports or aerobic exercise, with or without cognitive training, can improve cognitive function and physical fitness in older men with cognitive decline, and may contribute to strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Neurological diseases such as stroke or Parkinson's disease are often accompanied by weakening or loss of proprioception, which seriously affects the motor control ability of the patients. However, proprioception rehabilitation is challenging due to the pain caused by impaired joints and the hard efforts that patients have to make during training. This study investigated the cross-transfer effect of short-term visuomotor training to the untrained wrist from the trained wrist, from both views of behavioral results and brain activity analyses. Thirty healthy volunteers aged 25.53&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.95&#x2009;years were recruited for this study. They were randomly assigned into two groups: the visuomotor (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) group performed visuomotor training (VM group) and the conventional training (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) group (CT group) performed flexion and extension training on the right wrist. Behavioral tests (movement accuracy error, MAE) were performed both before and after training, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded. The movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) were calculated in the test session before and after training. Behavioral results showed that after visuomotor training of the right wrist on the VM group, the mean MAE of both the right wrist and untrained left wrist were reduced (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) after training. EEG topography showed reduced brain activity as the behavioral test task became familiar. ERPs showed a decrease in amplitude during the behavioral test for both trained and untrained wrist movements. MRCPs latency significantly increased at C3 and C4 while amplitude decreased at C3 and Cz for the right wrist; latency significantly increased at C3 while amplitude decreased at Cz for the left wrist. Increased power at CP3 for the right wrist and CP4 for the left wrist in &#x3b1;-frequency ERSP after VM was observed; reduced power in &#x3b2;-frequency ERSP after VM was observed for both wrists. For the CT group, the mean MAE of the trained right wrist increased (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) after training, while the untrained left wrist showed no statistical significance. No significant energy changes corresponding to the left/right wrist were observed in EEG topography after training. There was a noticeable decrease in ERPs amplitude at the central and parietal regions for both the left and right wrists. The MRCPs latency significantly increased at C3 for the right wrist; however, the latency and amplitude did not significantly change for the left wrist. Decreased power at FC3 and CP3 for the right wrist in &#x3b1;-frequency ERSP after CT was observed. From the regression analysis, the behavioral improvement of VM-R was correlated with CP3; the behavioral improvement of VM-L was correlated with C3, C4, CP3, and CP4. Visuomotor training on the right wrist led to proprioceptive improvements in both the trained and untrained wrists, demonstrating a cross-transfer effect. These findings suggest that visuomotor training could be used in rehabilitation protocols to improve proprioception in patients with neurological diseases, offering a less painful and more efficient method to restore motor control.",

    "abstract": "This study explores how immersive simulation-based learning affects nursing students' engagement, motivation, satisfaction, self-confidence, and knowledge gains in anatomy education. A quasi-experimental study was carried out from January to February 2025 among nursing students. A total of 76 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an experimental group receiving immersive simulation (n=38) and a control group following traditional instruction (n=38). A pre- and post-intervention test framework was implemented to evaluate changes in student engagement, motivation, satisfaction, self-confidence, and knowledge acquisition. Data analysis was done through non-parametric tests, specifically the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with IBM SPSS. The immersive simulation group demonstrated significant improvements in motivation (Z=-4.407, p&lt;0.001), engagement (Z=-3.555, p&lt;0.001), knowledge acquisition (Z=-3.213, p=0.001), and self-confidence (Z=-2.054, p=0.040) compared to the traditional method group. Nevertheless, the difference in learning satisfaction between the two groups was not statistically significant (Z=-1.660, p=0.097). These findings indicate that immersive simulation has a positive effect on nursing students' motivation, engagement, self-confidence, and knowledge acquisition. While satisfaction levels were comparable between groups, immersive simulation presents a valuable complement to traditional teaching methods and may help address educational challenges in healthcare training.",

    "abstract": "Transition from a categorical to a dimensional approach has been proposed in the field of psychosis. However, whether key features of schizophrenia, such as cognitive deficits, really do lie along a linear continuum remains uncertain. To explore this, we compared for the first time verbal learning impairments in six entities of the psychosis spectrum using linear, nonlinear, and categorical models. Studies involving verbal learning tests in familial high risk, clinical high risk, schizotypy/schizotypal, ultra-high risk, first episode of psychosis (FEP), and chronic schizophrenia populations were systematically searched in three databases in September 2024. Studies were included if they reported an immediate, delayed, or total recall measure in subclinical or clinical entities and healthy controls. The <i>metafor</i> package was used to compute effect sizes for the comparison between cases and control groups, categorized by psychosis entities. Model comparisons were also performed to compare linear, nonlinear, and categorical distributions of the effect sizes. The meta-analysis aggregated a total of 262 studies in the psychosis spectrum. Effect sizes were moderate in at-risk populations (&lt;0.50) and large in clinical populations (-1.00 for FEP and &gt;1.00 for chronic schizophrenia). A nonlinear model best explained our data in immediate recall, while the results in delayed and total recall suggest the inferiority of linear models. Our findings suggest a discontinuity in verbal learning between at-risk populations and clinical entities, challenging a purely linear dimensional model of cognitive impairment in the psychosis spectrum.",

In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, a music intervention (16 one-hour sessions in 8-10&#xa0;weeks, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;44) was compared to care-as-usual (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;53) at baseline, post-intervention and 8-weeks follow-up. Participants had a mean age of 47&#xa0;years (SD 15.4) and were diagnosed with mild or moderate ID. Four different EF components were tested: 1) cognitive flexibility, 2) attention, 3) inhibition and 4) working memory. Principal component analyses and multilevel models were applied to evaluate intervention effects. The music intervention showed no significant effect on EF compared to the care-as-usual group. Because the amount of invalid data exceeded the expected dropout rate, additional information is provided about the nature of this invalid data. This individual music intervention did not significantly improve EF in adults with mild or moderate ID. Results need to be interpreted with caution, given the methodological and feasibility challenges encountered.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common and disabling feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), and interventions to mitigate its negative functional consequences are in high demand. Metacognitive strategy interventions, such as the Multicontext (MC) Approach, may support daily function among people with PD (PwPD). To determine feasibility, participant acceptance, and preliminary estimates of the MC Approach's treatment effect for PwPD. Quasi-randomized controlled pilot trial. Participants underwent pretreatment assessment, allocation to treatment group (MC, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29; control, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28), 10 treatment sessions, 1-wk posttreatment assessment, and 3-mo questionnaire follow-up. Participants' homes. PwPD without dementia but with subjective cognitive concerns. Ten weekly sessions of the MC Approach, which aimed to develop awareness and strategies to control cognitive performance across activities via therapist mediation, functional activity performance, and homework. The control intervention used the same structure and treatment activities but did not address awareness or strategy use or use mediated learning. Indicators of trial feasibility (recruitment, retention, study duration), participant acceptance (satisfaction, homework completion), and treatment effect (self-rated functional cognitive goal performance). We enrolled 3 participants/mo and had 87% retention. Both groups' satisfaction and homework completion were high. Compared with control participants, MC participants reported greater improvement in functional cognitive goal performance from preintervention to postintervention that was maintained at follow-up. The MC Approach is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially efficacious intervention to address the functional cognitive goals of PwPD without dementia. A larger, fully randomized trial is required to provide definitive efficacy data. Plain-Language Summary: Cognitive impairment is one of the most common and disabling features of Parkinson's disease. As such, cognitive interventions that support daily function for this population are in high demand. The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility of one such potential intervention, the Multicontext (MC) Approach, among people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) without dementia. We also wanted to generate preliminary estimates of its effect on everyday cognitive function to inform future definitive trials. In a pilot quasi-randomized controlled trial, we found that the MC Approach is feasible, safe, and acceptable for people with PwPD. We also found that it may improve self-rated performance of daily cognitive goals. We can now proceed with a full-scale randomized controlled trial to determine its efficacy. Ultimately, this work will meet the pressing need for evidence-based cognitive interventions that improve or maintain occupational performance and participation among PwPD.",

    "abstract": "Preventing harm to others is a foundational principle of human morality that relies on distinct learning processes when avoiding harm to others versus oneself. Using a behavioral neuroendocrinology perspective, we investigated the effects of a single dose of testosterone administration on harm-avoidance learning. 120 healthy men randomly received either testosterone or placebo. Three hours later, participants completed a harm-avoidance task, learning over time to choose the option with a lower probability of electric shock to avoid harm either for themselves (Self condition) or for a stranger (Other condition). Behavioral analyses revealed that testosterone administration prolonged recipient differences across trials compared to placebo. Computational modeling quantified these recipient differences which were likely caused by testosterone administration. A reinforcement learning model with dual learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors (PEs) best accounted for individuals' choices. Analysis showed that, compared to placebo, testosterone enhanced learning from negative outcomes but suppressed learning from positive outcomes in the Self condition, without affecting learning rates in the Other condition. Additionally, testosterone administration slowed prosocial learning from negative outcomes compared to placebo and reversed its positive relationship with trait anxiety. Collectively, our findings offer precise computational insights into the role of testosterone administration in harm-avoidance learning. The results indicate that testosterone influences harm-avoidance learning, potentially in a self-protective and strategic prosocial manner. This study aims to enhance the comprehensive understanding of hormonal effects.",

Participants, including sixty-four Iranian EFL students, were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. While the control group participated in interactive speaking tasks in regular classes, the experimental group performed interactive tasks using SmallTalk2Me. Two tests were administered before and after treatment to measure the participants' speaking performance and anxiety: the IELTS speaking test and a modified form of the Foreign Language Classroom (Speaking) Anxiety Questionnaire (&#xd6;zt&#xfc;rk &amp; G&#xfc;rb&#xfc;z, 2014). Quantitative data were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), which reported a significant increase in speaking performance and a meaningful decrease in speaking anxiety in the experimental group. Fifteen learners from the experimental group were interviewed to collect qualitative data. The quantitative results hinted at the shared agency, perceiving a language learner as an augmented subject receiving augmented capabilities. Three primary themes were identified: learner-centered benefits, a supportive learning environment, and associated challenges and limitations. While qualitative findings advocate for self-regulated learning, enhanced learner engagement and motivation, and the significance of constructive feedback, they highlight concerns regarding the excessive reliance on AI, which may undermine autonomy and critical evaluation of alternative options due to automation. The findings indicate a potential trade-off between automation and autonomy in the speaking proficiency of EFL learners.",

    "title": "Alcohol-Induced Disinhibition of Facial Responses to Pain.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol in sub-toxic dosages has appeared to slightly reduce experimental pain in psychophysical paradigms. However, this effect may also reflect impaired scaling performance in subjective ratings. To address this, we additionally assessed facial responses as a more direct and cognitively unbiased pain measure, while acknowledging the potential confound of alcohol's effects on motor inhibitory function. We investigated 41 healthy participants (22 females) in a randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled design; targeting two moderate breath-alcohol levels (0.6&#x2030;, 0.8&#x2030;). Before and after an alcoholic or placebo drink, painful heat stimuli were applied to the forearm. Facial responses were analysed using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Subjective responses were assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). To control for alcohol's effects on motor inhibitory function, participants completed the antisaccade task, which assesses inhibitory control over reflexive motor responses (eye movement). While pain ratings were unaffected, alcohol significantly affected facial responses to pain, with the high alcohol dose leading to increased facial responses. Moreover, alcohol also led to a decrease in inhibitory control, with poorer performance in the antisaccade task. Not surprisingly, we found a significant association between the alcohol-induced increase in facial responses and the alcohol-induced decrease in inhibitory control. Alcohol-induced motor disinhibition likely enhanced facial responses to pain without altering the subjective pain experience. In consequence, individuals under the influence of alcohol may facially display stronger pain levels (than experienced), which should not be interpreted as intentional exaggeration by clinicians involved in pain assessment. Subtoxic doses of alcohol are known to produce weak analgesic effects. In contrast, the facial responses to pain were elevated under alcohol in the present study; probably due to an alcohol-induced motor disinhibition. Thus, individuals under the influence of alcohol may be analgized while in parallel being facially overly pain responsive.",

To systematically review and synthesize evidence on memory-making interventions for children and young people aged 0-19&#x2009;years with life-threatening or life-limiting conditions and their families in paediatric palliative and bereavement contexts. A systematic review conducted in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for mixed-methods reviews and reported using PRISMA guidelines. Narrative synthesis was used to identify key themes related to the effectiveness, implementation and family experiences of these interventions. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Scopus. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria, identifying three categories of memory-making interventions: storytelling-based, art-based legacy and physical keepsake creations. While statistical significance was limited, studies suggested small to moderate psychosocial benefits. Narrative synthesis identified four key themes: emotional expression and comfort; family connection and communication; memory preservation and personalization; and grieving support and continued bonds. Digital storytelling was the most common intervention. Families emphasized the need for personalized and culturally sensitive approaches to improve engagement and relevance. Memory-making interventions provide valuable emotional and psychosocial benefits for children and young people and their families in paediatric palliative and bereavement contexts. Tailored, well-supported interventions can strengthen resilience and well-being. Addressing challenges like technological barriers and cultural sensitivities may optimize these interventions and improve care quality.",

    "abstract": "In schizophrenia, episodic memory deficits are observed across verbal and visual memory tasks, as well as during free recall and recognition. Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormalities in several brain regions, though findings have often been inconsistent. To resolve these discrepancies, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide an updated understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in episodic memory deficits in schizophrenia. The meta-analysis included 59 functional neuroimaging studies using episodic memory tasks in schizophrenia. The analysis revealed reduced brain activity, during encoding, in the left para-hippocampal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left fusiform gyrus and the left striatum. During retrieval, reduced activations were observed in schizophrenia in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and medial superior frontal gyrus, the right angular gyrus and the left supplementary motor are. We found reduced activations in the memory-relevant para-hippocampal gyrus, as well as in brain regions involved in semantic processing, cognitive control and visual processing. This study fills critical gaps in understanding the neural correlates of episodic memory deficits in schizophrenia, offering insights into how cognitive functions are affected in this disorder.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research has increasingly concentrated on examining verbal working memory (VWM) with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the findings on whether ASD experience impairments in VWM are inconsistent, which could be attributed to various factors, including age, IQ, task variations, and participant heterogeneity. Therefore, this study undertakes a meta-analysis to review the advancements in research on VWM deficits in ASD, exploring the potential influence of factors such as age, IQ, sample size, and test tasks on VWM performance in this population. According to the Boolean algorithm, this study combined keywords related to VWM in children and adolescents with ASD, and published them in Web of Science, PsyCINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang Database to find all research findings in ASD related VWM published before 2024, and the final meta-analysis comprised 25 studies. The research conclusion indicate that children and adolescents with ASD have deficits in VWM. In addition, age, IQ, sample size, and testing tasks may not be important factors affecting the VWM in ASD. The conclusion of this study provides theoretical basis and clinical guidance for further exploring the influencing factors and intervention methods of VWM with ASD in the future.",

    "abstract": "This study explores nursing students' experiences and needs regarding chatbot-assisted learning, while evaluating the opportunities and challenges they encounter. As artificial intelligence (AI) advances, chatbots are increasingly integrated into nursing education, offering real-time feedback and personalized support. While chatbots show promise in enhancing theoretical knowledge and clinical skills, little is known about students' actual experiences and expectations. Gaining insight into students' perspectives is essential for optimizing chatbots' implementation in nursing education. This study conducts a systematic search of several electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang, using search terms related to nursing students, chatbots, experiences, perceptions, and qualitative research. A thematic synthesis approach is employed to extract and analyze the relevant studies. Nine studies were included in this review. Thematic synthesis revealed four major themes: perceived availability, role participation, potential challenges, and student needs. Nursing students highlighted chatbots' technical and interactive availability-valuing timely responses, ease of use, and personalized support. Chatbots were seen as active participants in learning, facilitating bidirectional communication, clinical simulation, information retrieval, academic assistance, and decision-making. However, concerns were raised regarding information accuracy, ethical risks, over-reliance, and misalignment with nursing values. Students expressed clear expectations for chatbot updates, curriculum integration, and regulatory oversight to ensure safe and effective usage. Chatbots not only offer substantial benefits for nursing education but also present notable challenges. Students prefer more specialized chatbots tailored to their diverse learning needs. They also emphasize the need for better regulation and training to improve chatbots' effectiveness. Educators should integrate chatbot training into curricula to enhance student readiness and ethical use. Policymakers must prioritize regulation that ensures data protection, content accuracy, and equitable access. Developing nursing-specific chatbot systems and institutional guidelines is essential for responsible adoption and sustainable innovation.",

    "abstract": "There continues to be growing interest in the Science of Learning including identifying ways to apply findings. Presently, little is known about learning during healthy adulthood and methods to improve that learning. The main objective of the present systematic review is to identify and synthesize all recent cognitive and brain research investigating learning during healthy aging in adulthood. Searches were performed across Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases to identify published and unpublished studies conducted in healthy adults. Eligible studies reported measures of learning-related cognition, brain structure or function and their relationship with age, or effects of interventions to improve learning. Risk of bias was assessed using either the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool or Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Search and screening were performed by three trained reviewers. Included studies were summarized using narrative synthesis and, for intervention studies, an effect direction plot. A total of 265 relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Studies were primarily lab-based cross-sectional studies conducted in Western contexts. Findings revealed an overall decline in learning-related cognitive and brain outcomes during healthy aging. However, declines were more pronounced in fluid abilities and explicit learning and memory while crystalized abilities and implicit learning and memory showed stability. Generally, higher education and socioeconomic status positively modulated age-related learning trajectories while baseline cognitive function influenced the effectiveness of interventions. Findings from the present systematic review are potentially limited by the exclusive focus on healthy aging and the small number of included studies conducted in non-Western contexts. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Pressure injury poses significant challenges in nursing homes, exacerbated by aging populations and gaps in caregivers' training. This study evaluated the efficacy of the social learning theory-based training program in improving Chinese nursing home assistants' pressure injury prevention and management competence. Two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial. Nursing assistants in 4 Chinese nursing homes. A cluster randomized controlled trial allocated 95 participants from 4 nursing homes to intervention (n = 46) or control (n = 49). The intervention group received a social learning theory-based training program, which involved a blended teaching-learning model combining online (15 short videos for a total of 2 hours of online sessions) and traditional face-to-face offline (a total of 5 hours of offline sessions) methods spanning over 4 weeks. Outcomes (knowledge, attitudes, practices, visual identification skills, and self-efficacy) were assessed at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 3 months postintervention using validated tools. The intervention group showed significant improvements immediately postintervention (P &lt; .001) in all outcomes, with sustained gains in knowledge, attitudes, practices, and self-efficacy. Visual identification skills declined to baseline by 3 months postintervention (P &gt; .05). Between-group differences favored the intervention at all time points (P &lt; .001). Satisfaction exceeded 90%, highlighting program feasibility. A social learning theory-based training program can effectively enhance nursing assistants' pressure injury prevention and management competence; however, visual identification skill retention requires reinforcement. This scalable, theory-driven model addresses global workforce training gaps in long-term care, offering actionable strategies to reduce pressure injury incidence and improve care quality for aging populations.",

    "abstract": "As an inter-individual psychological and behavioural construct, coachability is hypothesised to be a fundamental determinant of learning and performance enhancement within sport, business and education domains. Despite its perceived importance, consensus on a precise definition and its exact dimensional components has yet to be established. This systematic review aimed to: (1) establish consensus on a common definition and (2) identify consistent constituent component constructs of coachability&#xa0;evident in the literature. Using systematic search and screening methods, 53 articles (41 studies; 12 grey literature) from sources spanning 5 decades were identified. Findings revealed variable definitions of coachability that evolved with respective theoretical and investigatory paradigm shifts. Nonetheless, throughout, coachability was consistently considered a multi-component construct. Literature supported the existence of potentially six inter-connected component dimensions: Attentiveness to information; Willingness to learn; Persistence in overcoming setbacks; Feedback seeking; Feedback receptivity; and Feedback implementation. For each component, evidence illustrating psychological and behavioural features resonating with higher and lower component presence was identified. Identified components were also validated through independent interviews with sport coaches. Collectively, findings established a synthesised consensus definition aligned with identified component dimensions, reflecting: an individual's willingness and ability to seek, receive and act upon constructive feedback to persistently foster self-development and enhance performance in a given domain. Given the limited assessments, methodologies and instruments available, research is recommended to refine and validate assessment instruments, verify constituent components identified, confirm relationships between coachability and developmental outcomes, and identify coachability optimisation strategies to benefit personal development within domain contexts.",

    "abstract": "Meta-cognitive Training (MCT) is a promising therapeutic approach for schizophrenia. However, the extent to which demographic factors influence its efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms and cognitive biases, as well as enhancing cognitive insight, needs further examination. A comprehensive search of databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, (2007-November 2024) published only in English was conducted. Thirty-seven studies (81&#xa0;% randomized, 19&#xa0;% non-randomized trials) were included. Inclusion criteria were participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or related psychotic disorders, and there were no sex, gender, race, or ethnicity restrictions. We analyzed the influence of demographic factors on the efficacy of MCT, and the meta-regression analyses were conducted for variables including sex, age, duration of illness, and years of education. MCT significantly reduced positive symptoms (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.40; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), delusions (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.41; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and improved cognitive insight (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.28; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Women benefit more in cognitive insight in self-reflectiveness scale (d&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.27; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.05). However, no statistically significant gender differences were observed in other domains. Furthermore, no significant results were observed for other sociodemographic variables under study. MCT has been demonstrated to be an effective therapeutic method in the reduction of symptoms associated with schizophrenia, with the impact of demographic factors being limited. The enhancement of cognitive insight, particularly in the domains of self-reflectiveness and self-confidence, has been demonstrated in women. Future research should consider individual differences, particularly in the context of gender to advance personalized therapeutic approaches and optimize psychological interventions.",

    "abstract": "Clinical care and research need to improve treatment availability for auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). To provide further evidence, we examined the efficacy of an unguided six-weeks self-help intervention for AVH (MCT<sub>Voice</sub>) based on metacognitive training. N&#xa0;=&#xa0;78 participants with distressing AVH were recruited from clinical and non-clinical settings. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the MCT<sub>Voice</sub> with a waitlist control group (WL<sub>control</sub>), both receiving additional treatment-as-usual. Outcomes were the frequency and distress of AVH, general hallucinatory and psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and satisfaction with the intervention, following an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) principle. Besides, we conducted an explorative cluster analysis to examine subgroups of voice hearers. We found no significant differences between the groups on the frequency and distress of AVH. However, general hallucinatory experiences were significantly reduced in the MCT<sub>Voice</sub> compared to the WL<sub>control</sub> group in PP-data (F(3,48)&#xa0;=&#xa0;39.51, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.038, &#x3b7;<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.09).

    "abstract": "Anatomy education in the undergraduate medical curriculum faces many competing interests, including the increasing demand for ultrasound learning. Instead of being treated as a separate subject, ultrasound can offer a unique lens to visualize anatomy without using cadaveric materials. This study used a randomized controlled design to compare learning with hands-on ultrasound to learning on cadavers. Forty preclinical medical students were randomized to an experimental group or a control group. Both groups attended a session covering structures in the neck, upper limb, and abdomen. The experimental group learned using hands-on ultrasound imaging, while the control group was taught on a dissected cadaver. Participants completed multiple-choice tests on anatomical relationships and structure identification at four time points: presession, post-session, 1-week follow-up, and 1-month follow-up. There was no statistical difference between test scores of the two groups. The post-session average score (54% for cadaver group, 57% for ultrasound group) more than doubled the presession average score (20% for cadaver group, 25% for ultrasound group) (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). One-week follow-up and 1-month follow-up scores (40%-44%) significantly decreased from immediate post-session for both groups. Eighteen of the 20 ultrasound-facilitated participants felt more confident operating an ultrasound device compared to before the session. Three quarters of all participants agreed hands-on ultrasound should be part of their anatomy education. This study shows hands-on ultrasound imaging can effectively substitute cadaver-based learning of certain anatomy topics at the introductory level. Ultrasound integration highlights the clinical relevance of anatomy and provides an innovative tool for anatomical education.",

    "abstract": "Understanding differences in conditioning with stimuli evoking fear and/or disgust is valuable to develop meaningful interventions for phobias, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). We investigated possible differences in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned responses using unconditioned stimuli (UCS) which elicit fear, disgust, or both emotions simultaneously. Participants underwent a sequential conditioning paradigm over three consecutive days (acquisition, extinction, and extinction retrieval) and were randomly assigned to fear (F), disgust (D), or mixed (FD) conditioning. Pictorial stimuli (UCS) and neutral faces (as conditioned stimuli; CS) were used, with CS-UCS contingency, valence, fear, and disgust ratings as readout measures. The D and FD groups showed higher valence and disgust ratings after acquisition than the F group, with no group differences in CS-UCS contingency or fear ratings. During extinction, the F group had the greatest reduction in CS-UCS contingency ratings, and the D group showed the largest decrease in disgust ratings for CS+. At extinction retrieval, disgust ratings decreased most in the D group, while fear ratings dropped most in the F and FD groups for CS-. No significant group differences were found for valence during extinction and extinction retrieval. Conditioning with UCS evoking disgust or disgust and fear simultaneously led to stronger negative valence and disgust responses compared to conditioning with fear-evoking stimuli. Extinction was most effective in the F group (highest reduction of CS-UCS contingency ratings), offering some support for the idea that disgust may be more resistant to extinction than fear.",

    "abstract": "Balance disorders are a major modifiable risk factor for falls, and balance exercises reduce fall rates. However, the effectiveness of balance exercises may depend on the relationship between the task difficulty and individual skill levels. This study aimed to explore the impact of task difficulty on the motor learning benefits of balance exercises. A sex-stratified, randomized, and non-blinded study was conducted among 40 community-dwelling older adults assigned to either a low- or high-difficulty balance exercise group. The task difficulty was manipulated by altering the support component affixed to an unstable board. Balance performance was measured using a stability index, and functional task difficulty was assessed using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). The experiment included a pre-test, practice trials, and post-test conducted 24&#xa0;h later. Statistical analyses included analysis of variance and regression analyses to examine the impact of task difficulty on motor learning and the relationship between motor learning benefits and task difficulty. While both groups showed improved balance performance with practice, the low-difficulty group demonstrated greater motor learning benefits at the 24-h post-test (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Regression analysis showed a curvilinear relationship between the performance dimension score of the NASA-TLX and motor learning benefits (y = -0.017x<sup>2</sup> + 1.843x - 26.711, adjusted R<sup>2</sup>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.380, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001).

    "abstract": "High frequency deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is a well-established therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms, however, its effect on non-motor symptoms is controversial. Low frequency DBS can improve cognition, but its effects on motor functions are detrimental. Our goal was to evaluate the effect on verbal fluency (VF) of dual frequency STN-DBS combining high and low frequency (130&#x2009;+&#x2009;10&#x2009;Hz) as compared to 130&#x2009;Hz or 10&#x2009;Hz alone and to OFF stimulation. The effect on motor symptoms, working memory, and subjective feelings was also assessed. We used a randomized order of experimental conditions with a double-blind design to assess the effects of 130&#x2009;Hz, 10&#x2009;Hz, and 130&#x2009;+&#x2009;10&#x2009;Hz stimulation as compared to OFF stimulation in 18 PD patients with STN-DBS. In each condition, participants completed: phonemic and action VF, N-back task, and visual analogue scales for fatigue and stress level. Motor functions and gait velocity were also assessed. Friedman analysis of variance were conducted to determine whether change scores from baseline OFF stimulation, in our primary (VF) and secondary outcomes measures (motor functions, N-back task, subjective feelings) were different in the three stimulation conditions. VF improved more in the 130&#x2009;+&#x2009;10&#x2009;Hz condition than 130&#x2009;Hz condition (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006); there was no difference between 130&#x2009;+&#x2009;10&#x2009;Hz and 10&#x2009;Hz (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.2) and between 130HZ and 10&#x2009;Hz (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6).

    "abstract": "A predisposition to elevated food reward may hinder weight loss success during multidisciplinary interventions. However, this has not been consistently demonstrated in adults, nor at all in children. To test the associations between explicit and implicit food reward and preference at baseline and prospective changes in weight and body composition in adolescents with obesity. A meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials in adolescents with obesity was undertaken using frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models. Participants from each study took part in similar 12-week multidisciplinary interventions. Liking and wanting for foods varying in fat content and sweet taste were assessed at enrolment, and both anthropometrics were tracked from enrolment to post-intervention. In a grand sample of N&#x2009;=&#x2009;132 adolescents with obesity, liking and wanting for high-fat foods did not significantly predict changes in weight or fat mass. However, implicit wanting for sweet foods predicted changes in standardised body and lean mass, such that a greater wanting for sweet foods was associated with greater loss of body (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039, &#x3b7;<sup>2</sup>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) and lean mass (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, &#x3b7;<sup>2</sup>p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13) in both frequentist and Bayesian analyses. Baseline implicit wanting for sweet (high carbohydrate, low protein), but not energy-dense, foods may be more strongly related to prospective changes in lean mass than fat mass during weight loss in adolescents with obesity.

    "title": "Effect of physical activities on cognition and the ability to perform a dual task in children with autism spectrum disorder: a randomized clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "To investigate effectiveness of physical activities on cognitive function and ability to perform a dual task in children with ASD. This randomized clinical trial involved 30 children with high-functioning ASD, aged 6-12 years, who were randomly assigned to either experimental (n: 15) or control group (n: 15). The experimental group underwent 24 sessions of physical training aimed at improving balance, agility, central stability, and motor coordination (3 sessions per week), while control group continued with their rehabilitation routine services. Cognitive function was assessed using Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) questionnaire, forward and backward digit span tests before and after 4-week intervention. The ability to perform a dual task was evaluated through center of pressure (COP) parameters during static and dynamic balance tasks while performing the forward digit span test. All participants finished the study and analyzed. Following the intervention, experimental group exhibited a significant increase in BRIEF scores including inhibition, emotional control, planning/organization, working memory, and initiation, compared to control group. The experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in backward digit span test, but not in forward item. For the ability to perform a dual task based on static balance, experimental group showed a significant reduction in medial-lateral/anterior-posterior displacements, and area sway of COP on non-dominant leg with eyes closed, compared to the control group. Physical exercises have the potential to enhance cognitive function in autistic children. Despite the lack of a large difference between the groups in dual-task performance, physical exercises may effectively improve balance during such tasks.",

    "title": "The effectiveness of tDCS on motor sequence learning in high and low-physical activity older adults.",
    "abstract": "It appears that applying multi-session anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning tasks would induce larger and longer-lasting motor behavioral effects compared to sham a-tDCS in high and low-physical activity older adults. To examine the short-term and long-term outcomes of multiple sessions of M1 a-tDCS with the serial reaction time task (SRTT) on motor learning in both high and low-physical activity older adults. In this single-blind, randomized, parallel-arm, sham-controlled trial, 56 older adults-28 with high physical activity and 28 with low physical activity-were randomly assigned to either the sham or real a-tDCS group, with 14 participants in each group. The participants took part in eight blocks of SRTT for five consecutive days in combination with a-tDCS or sham tDCS. Response time and error rate were measured before the intervention, one day, and one week after the completion of the intervention. According to the study results, there were significant differences in error rate and reaction time between older adults who underwent a-tDCS and those who underwent sham-tDCS in both physical activity levels (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Additionally, we observed a significant difference in motor learning improvements (reaction time and error rate) between older adults with high and low levels of physical activity following the a-tDCS intervention (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). The findings demonstrated that older adults who received a-tDCS, particularly those with higher physical activity, experienced greater improvements in both reaction time and error rate during SRTT sessions than those who received sham stimulation, both immediately after the intervention and one week later.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to examine the modulatory effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on Chronic low back pain (cLBP). 70 cLBP patients were recruited and randomized into taVNS or transcutaneous greater auricular nerve stimulation (tGANS) group. Both interventions were administered by participants themselves after initial training (five times/week for four weeks). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected at baseline and after 4-week interventions. Seed-based static and dynamic functional connectivity (sFC and dFC) were performed to investigate the modulation effects on descending pain modulation system and reward network using the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) as seeds. 51 patients (taVNS: n &#x200b;= &#x200b;25; tGANS: n &#x200b;= &#x200b;26) completed the study. Within-group comparisons showed a significant improvement in pain-related outcomes for both groups. Between-group comparisons revealed no significant differences. FC analysis showed that both taVNS and tGANS can increase the PAG - postcentral gyrus sFC. The taVNS is associated with increased PAG - amygdala and PAG - paracentral gyrus and decreased PAG - medial frontal cortex sFCs compared to tGANS. The present study suggest that both taVNS and tGANS can alleviate cLBP through distinct yet overlapping pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of auricular nerve stimulation as a telehealth solution for cLBP and other chronic pain conditions.",

    "title": "Everyday memory and metacognitive intervention: a randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "This study evaluated whether the Everyday Memory and Metacognitive Intervention (EMMI) improved everyday memory functioning and subjective memory among older adults. The EMMI uses a metacognitive approach to link awareness of situational cognitive demands to the selection and use of strategies to bypass cognitive constraints and to successfully achieve everyday goals. The randomized controlled trial randomly assigned participants to the EMMI group or an active control group trained in mnemonic strategies for word list memorization. We used an event-based ecological momentary assessment smartphone application to assess self-reported everyday memory failures during everyday life. We also evaluated group differences in pretest to posttest change on objective and subjective measures of memory. An intent-to-treat analysis of the 78 persons randomly assigned to conditions revealed no difference in measures assessed prior to the intervention. The final sample consisted of 30 EMMI participants (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;75.83, <i>SD</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.68) and 32 control group participants (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;74.94, <i>SD</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.38). There were no differences between the groups on everyday memory failures and prospective memory. Both groups showed significant increases in aspects of subjective memory ability from pretest to posttest, with the EMMI group producing greater improvements in memory self-efficacy. The control group differentially improved in associative memory after memory-strategy training. Although EMMI did not show the predicted everyday memory improvements, it still has potential to improve people's everyday functioning by way of improving subjective experiences. Post-pandemic enhancements to the intervention could lead to demonstrable everyday memory successes.",

    "abstract": "Adjusting practice to different goals and characteristics is key to learning, but its development remains unclear. Across 2 preregistered experiments, 190 4-to-8-year-olds (106 female; mostly White; data collection: December 2021-September 2022) and 31 adults played an easy and a difficult game, then chose one to practice before a test on either the easy, difficult, or a randomly chosen game. All children adjusted their active practice choices to condition. When the test game was known, they practiced that game. However, when the test game was randomly chosen, only children 6+ and adults practiced the difficult game, while younger children only showed a trending effect. This suggests that the ability to prepare for uncertainty may develop between ages 4 and 6.",

    "title": "Efficacy and mechanisms of repeated closed-loop auditory exposure during slow-wave sleep for internet gaming disorder.",
    "abstract": "Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) is marked by impaired psychological and social functioning but remains without effective treatments. Cue exposure therapy (CET) is typically administered during wakefulness to help extinguish addictive memories. However, recent studies suggest that sleep may be an optimal state for memory modulation. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of repeated closed-loop exposure to game sounds during UP-state of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on IGD. 84 participants meeting DSM-5 criteria for IGD were randomly assigned to sleep intervention/control groups (SIG/SCG) or awake intervention/control groups (AIG/ACG) with two consecutive days of intervention. During SWS of two intervention nights, around 300 sounds were exposed at slow-wave UP-state. While the awake groups received similar auditory cue exposure during the awake state for two consecutive days. Cravings, playtime, and P300 amplitude in the cue reactivity task were recorded at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up intervals (1, 2, 3, weeks, and 1 month). Results showed that the SIG significantly reduced cravings (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and playtime (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) at post-intervention and follow-up, whereas awake CET showed no effect. The SIG exhibited higher low-frequency and early spindle power, along with lower late spindle power after sound exposure. Notably, the linear increase in sound-elicited late spindle power across the 20 intervention blocks over two experiment nights was positively correlated with reduced cravings post-intervention (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015), especially among participants achieving a craving reduction greater than 30% after one month. Our findings suggest that closed-loop auditory exposure during SWS presents a promising, non-invasive intervention strategy for treating IGD, potentially exerting its effects by modulating late spindle power.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined the effects of brief focused breathing techniques. This study investigated the impact of brief slow-paced breathing (SPB) with a longer exhalation on working memory and perceived mood, stress, and arousal. Between-subjects experimental design. Participants (139 undergraduates, 69% female) were randomized to a one-time SPB session or a mind-wandering active control condition. The participants completed the OSPAN working memory task and state measures of mood, stress, and arousal at three time points: baseline, post-manipulation, and post-task. OSPAN performance improved in the experimental group. Mood improved in the experimental group but decreased in the control group from baseline to post-manipulation and then decreased in both conditions after completing the OSPAN task. Stress decreased in the experimental group from baseline to post-manipulation and was significantly different from the control group at the post-manipulation time point. Stress then increased from post-manipulation to post-task in both conditions. Arousal decreased in both conditions from baseline to post-manipulation but then increased from post-manipulation to post-task. The current results demonstrate that a brief SPB session with longer exhalation improved working memory and temporarily improved mood and stress thus providing a just-in-time intervention to help individuals cope with stress-inducing conditions.",
