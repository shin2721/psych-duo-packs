    "abstract": "The author examined 2 distinctive aspects of emotion regulation in mathematics homework, including emotion management and cognitive reappraisal. Participants were 1,799 high school students from 46 classes in China. Two multilevel models were run, 1 with emotion management and another with cognitive reappraisal as the dependent variable. Both emotion management and cognitive reappraisal were positively associated with 5 individual-level variables (monitoring motivation, managing time, learning-oriented reasons, self-concept, and teacher feedback) and 1 class-level variable (self-concept). In addition, at the individual level, emotion management was associated negatively with adult-oriented reasons but positively with arranging the environment and prior mathematics achievement. Meanwhile, cognitive reappraisal was positively associated with parent education at the class level.",

    "abstract": "For students to thrive in the U.S. educational system, they must successfully cope with omnipresent demands of exams. Nearly all students experience testing situations as stressful, and signs of stress (e.g., racing heart) are typically perceived negatively. This research tested the efficacy of a psychosituational intervention targeting cognitive appraisals of stress to improve classroom exam performance. Ninety-three students (across five semesters) enrolled in a community college developmental mathematics course were randomly assigned to stress reappraisal or placebo control conditions. Reappraisal instructions educated students about the adaptive benefits of stress arousal, whereas placebo materials instructed students to ignore stress. Reappraisal students reported less math evaluation anxiety and exhibited improved math exam performance relative to controls. Mediation analysis indicated reappraisal improved performance by increasing students' perceptions of their ability to cope with the stressful testing situation (resource appraisals). Implications for theory development and policy are discussed. [At time of submission to ERIC this article was in press with &quot;Social Psychological and Personality Science.&quot;]",

    "abstract": "Most Americans will experience a form of trauma before adulthood, resulting in hindered learning and emotional regulation. The purpose of this quantitative, correlational-predictive study was to examine if and to what extent the two facets of Emotional Regulation, Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression, considered collectively, and individually within standard regression model, significantly predict the Well-being of online undergraduate learners in the United States. Emotion regulation theory and PERMA theory of well-being supported this research. The research questions predicted a correlation exists between the emotion regulation ability and well-being in online undergraduate learners. The sample of 84 online undergraduate learners completed two questionnaires, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the PERMA Profiler. The findings of a standard multiple linear regression indicated that the two facets of Emotional Regulation, Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression considered together significantly predict the Well-being of online undergraduate learners in the United States, adjusted R[superscript 2] = 0.611, F(2, 81) = 66.209, p &lt; 0.001. The model accounted for 61.1% of the variance in learners' overall well-being. Both predictors considered individually within the model were statistically significant: Cognitive Reappraisal was a significant direct (positive) predictor of overall Well-being: [beta] = 0.597, t = 6.75, p &lt; 0.001, whereas Expressive Suppression was a significant inverse (negative) predictor of online undergraduate learners' overall Well-being: [beta] = -0.260, t = -2.93, p = 0.004. These findings point to the need to strengthen online undergraduate learners' emotional regulation as a means to enhance their well-being.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical linear modeling techniques were used to explored individual and contextual factors of emotion regulation in a sample of 2074 adolescents from grade 7 through grade 12 and 54 head teachers in China mainland. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R) were administered among students and Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale (MDEES) among head teachers. Results showed that at the student level, Effortful Control and Affiliativeness were positively related to adolescents' reappraisal whereas Surgency was inversely correlated with reappraisal after gender, grade level and parent's education were controlled. And Negative Affect (NA) positively predicted suppression. At the teacher level, teachers' Emotional Contagion promoted the impact of adolescent Surgency on reappraisal after teaching age was controlled. In addition, Responsive Crying, Emotional Attention and Feeling for Others enhanced the influence of NA upon Suppression among teachers. However, Positive Sharing weakened the negative association between NA and Suppression. These findings expand the understanding of the role of teacher empathy in adolescents' emotional development, and have important implications for classroom management and teacher empathy training.",

Participants expressed hopes that meditation would help them manage stress and anxiety, improve their focus and relationships, and support their personal growth and motivation. With respect to lived experiences of formal meditation, we found that without explicit prompting, approximately 86% of coded phrases reflected dimensions of experience that could be mapped within the matrix, suggesting its efficacy for coding. Furthermore, almost all participants attributed mindfulness to improving their general wellness, with dereification, breathing, and nonaversive affect frequently mentioned as key factors leading to these improvements. Additionally, consistent with the neurophenomenological aims of the matrix, we list cognitive outcomes and neurophysiological mechanisms potentially attributable to the nature of selected appraisal statements by participants.",

Participants received eight face-to-face sessions of manualized Internet-supported CBT for problem drinking with or without trauma-focused emotion regulation skills (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy [TARGET]). Both interventions were associated with sustained (at one-month follow-up) reductions in self-reported drinking frequency, drinking-related impairment, and heavy drinking in the past week, as well as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD symptoms, and improvement in self-reported emotion regulation. The enhanced intervention was associated with significantly greater sustained reductions in complex PTSD symptoms and resulted in medium/large effect size reductions in days of alcohol use (versus small effects by CBT). Emotion regulation enhancement of CBT for college student problem drinkers with interpersonal trauma histories warrants further investigation.",

The current study tested whether teachers' cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, occupational burnout, and life satisfaction in the fall were related to the level, and trajectory across the school year, of three indicators of student well-being: student-reported positive outlook, student-reported emotional distress, and peer-reported prosocial behavior. Multilevel growth modeling was employed to examine data from 15 elementary teachers and their 320 students. Teachers' emotion regulation skills and life satisfaction were associated with students' well-being: when teachers used cognitive reappraisal, students reported low emotional distress; when teachers used expressive suppression, students reported a less positive outlook and peers reported few prosocial behaviors; teachers' life satisfaction was associated with high levels of prosocial behavior. Effects on the trajectory of student well-being were not significant. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology&quot; v69 Article 101151 2020.]",

Data collected from a sample of 113 Israeli teachers were analysed using structural equation modelling analysis and cluster analysis. Path model analysis indicated that suppression mediates the relations between teachers' conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism on one hand, and their negative mood on the other, and that reappraisal mediates the relations between teachers' conscientiousness and neuroticism on one hand, and their positive mood on the other. Cluster analysis revealed associations between three personality types of teachers with their emotion regulation and mood.

A cross-sectional, predictive, and non-experimental design was applied with a sample of 366 firefighters. Participants completed the Emotional Sensitivity Scale and the Individual Work Performance Scale. Data analysis included Spearman's correlation and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results revealed a weak but statistically significant negative correlation between emotional sensitivity and work performance (&#x3c1; = -0.19; p = 0.001), with Positive Emotional Sensitivity showing the strongest association (&#x3c1; = -0.22; p &lt; 0.001). Among males, Positive Emotional Sensitivity negatively predicted Work Performance in the Context (&#x3b2; = -0.235; f<sup>2</sup> = 0.050), while Negative Egocentric Sensitivity also showed a negative effect (&#x3b2; = -0.190; f<sup>2</sup> = 0.030). For females, Negative Egocentric Sensitivity exerted a stronger negative influence on Work Performance in the Context (&#x3b2; = -0.392; f<sup>2</sup> = 0.133). No significant associations were found between emotional sensitivity and counterproductive behaviors (p &gt; 0.05). The findings indicate that emotional sensitivity, particularly its positive and negative egocentric forms, may adversely affect work performance in firefighters. These results underscore the importance of developing differentiated emotional regulation and stress management interventions tailored by sex to support occupational performance in high-demand professions.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, CBT does not lead to a satisfying symptom reduction in a considerable number of patients with OCD. The identification of variables that predict insufficient treatment response could improve efficient treatment selection and inform the development of specific augmentative treatments. In the current study, we tested whether prediction of treatment response can be improved by including neurobiological markers during working memory (WM) performance. Forty-four patients with a primary OCD diagnosis participated in an n-back WM task with varying WM load while functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was performed. Subsequently, all patients received CBT in an outpatient clinic. WM load-dependent modulation of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in a bilateral cluster in inferior/superior parietal lobule predicted CBT response over and above clinical and sociodemographic variables (p &lt; 0.05). Higher modulation was associated with larger relative symptom reduction. The results of the current study indicate that the ability of the WM system to flexibly adapt to changing task demands might be a useful indicator of CBT response in OCD. Possibly, this mechanism facilitates relearning processes during exposure-based CBT. However, findings need to be replicated in larger samples.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined the effectiveness of CBT among war-traumatised Arab children, including Palestinian children. This study aimed to assess the effect of a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program on enhancing resilience and alleviating complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) symptoms among Palestinian children affected by political detention. A quasi-experimental design utilising a one-group pretest-posttest approach was employed. The study included 50 affected children recruited from non-governmental organizations and community organizations in conflict-affected regions of the West Bank. The CBT program comprised seven sessions totaling 9&#x2009;h. Each session lasted between 60 and 90&#x2009;min. Data were collected before and after the program, which was implemented from March to May 2025. The findings from the pretest and posttest revealed a statistically significant reduction in CPTSD symptoms and improvement in resilience following the program. Resilience scores increased from a mean of 19.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.6 to 30.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.6, indicating enhanced resilience capacity (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;16.457, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms showed a substantial decline from severe 14.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.5 to minimal 1.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.8 (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001). Similarly, disturbances in self-organization significantly decreased. The results proved the effectiveness of a CBT program in improving resilience and minimising CPTSD symptoms among participants. Thus, policymakers and healthcare professionals must ensure that psychological support programs, such as CBT, are implemented among war-traumatised children. Additionally, healthcare professionals, including nurses, should be equipped to respond effectively and provide high-quality care for traumatised children.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of institutional care on sleep quality, cognitive functions, and quality of life in individuals aged 65 and over living in T&#xfc;rkiye. This cross-sectional study included a total of 62 elderly individuals, either residing in a nursing home or living in their own homes. Participants were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and WHO-5 Well-Being Index. After adjusting for age and education, ANCOVA confirmed that nursing home residents had significantly lower MMSE scores than community-dwelling individuals (F(1,58)=7.98, p=0.006, partial &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.121). The mean PSQI score of the participants was 8.06&#xb1; 3.3, and 64.5% had a score &#x2265;5, indicating poor sleep quality overall. The MMSE scores were significantly lower in nursing home residents compared to community-dwelling individuals (22.2 &#xb1; 4.4 vs. 25.2 &#xb1; 3.4; p = 0.005). These differences in MMSE remained significant after adjustment for age and education (ANCOVA, p=0.006). Sleep latency was shorter (p = 0.022) and daytime dysfunction was higher (p = 0.028) among nursing home residents, while sleep efficiency was significantly better in those living at home (p = 0.030). A weak but statistically significant negative weak correlation was found between PSQI and WHO-5 scores (r = -0.299, 95% CI: -0.51 to -0.05, p = 0.018). However, no significant correlation was observed between PSQI and MMSE scores. Nursing-home residents exhibited lower cognitive performance and poorer sleep efficiency compared to community dwellers, reflecting group differences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n                Objectives\n                A positive association between trait mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal has previously been found. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated the impact of an 8-week MBSR course on early and late stages of emotion regulation using mindfulness and reappraisal.\n              \n                Methods\n                Participants were allocated into an 8-week MBSR training group (n = 14 for task reports and self-reports; n = 10 for ERPs) or a wait-list control group (n = 15 for task reports and self-reports; n = 11 for ERPs). Pre and post the 8-week training, participants completed an affective picture viewing task and were instructed to regulate their responses to negative and neutral images using mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression.\n              \n                Results\n                At post-test, only the training group showed significant improvements in self-reported trait mindfulness and trait cognitive reappraisal, together with improvements in the self-reported ability to employ mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal during the task. The training group showed decreased 200–280 ms positivity across all three strategies at post-test. The LPP did not change over time but overall showed more positive mean amplitudes to cognitive appraisal.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                These findings suggest that MBSR may adaptively modulate early attention deployment to emotional stimuli, but modulations of later stages of emotion processing may require more extensive mindfulness training. In addition, conscious employment of mindfulness may require less cognitive effort than cognitive reappraisal.",

    "abstract": "Putatively, mindfulness meditation involves generation of a state of \"nonappraisal\", yet, little is known about how mindfulness may influence appraisal processes. We investigated whether the state and practice of mindfulness could enhance cognitive reappraisal. Participants (N = 44; M age = 24.44, SD = 4.00, range 19 - 38, 82.2% female) were randomized to either 1) mindfulness, 2) suppression, or 3) mind-wandering induction training conditions. Cognitive reappraisal was assessed with the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) prior to experimental induction, and state mindfulness was assessed immediately following induction using the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS). Participants practiced their assigned strategy for one week and then were reassessed with the ERQ reappraisal subscale. Participants receiving mindfulness training reported significantly higher levels of state mindfulness than participants in the thought suppression and mind wandering conditions. Although brief mindfulness training did not lead to significantly greater increases in reappraisal than the other two conditions, state mindfulness during mindfulness meditation was prospectively associated with increases in reappraisal. Path analysis revealed that the indirect effect between mindfulness training and reappraisal was significant through state mindfulness. Degree of state mindfulness achieved during the act of mindfulness meditation significantly predicted increases in reappraisal over time, suggesting that mindfulness may promote emotion regulation by enhancing cognitive reappraisal.",

    "abstract": "Inadequate emotion regulation may underlie the development of psychopathology as well as worsened physical health, particularly in the context of life stress. Cognitive reappraisal is typically considered an adaptive strategy to manage negative emotions. However, the extent to which reappraisal is beneficial may hinge upon contextual and individual differences. Specifically, it is unclear whether and how the ability to reappraise effectively (i.e., reappraisal ability) and exposure to stressful life events moderate the association between habitual reappraisal and health. Using a series of questionnaires and an experimental task designed to measure the ability to effectively down-regulate sad emotions using reappraisal, the present study examined the interactive effects of habitual reappraisal, reappraisal ability, and exposure to stressful life events on depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as self-reported physical health in 400 young adults (62.5% women; mean age = 19.8 &#xb1; 2.5). Results indicated that habitual reappraisal may protect against elevated depressive symptoms and worsened self-reported physical health for people exposed to more stressful life events. Moreover, reappraising often appeared to be particularly beneficial for those who were less effective in their attempts. Results for anxiety symptoms were not significant, although habitual reappraisal remained significantly associated with anxiety symptoms as a lower-order term. These findings provide novel contributions to the field of emotion regulation and health by clarifying that exposure to stressful life events is a key moderator in the association between reappraisal and some areas of health and by elucidating the important roles of both habitual reappraisal and reappraisal ability.

    "abstract": "Emotional stress throughout the day is known to affect objective sleep physiology and subjective sleep quality. In the interplay between emotions and sleep, emotion regulation plays a critical role in the recovery from stressful, emotional events and subsequent sleep. While the effects of top-down emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive reappraisal on sleep have been studied before, the impact of bottom-up emotion regulation strategies such as experiential emotion regulation is understudied. Cognitive reappraisal reflects the cognitive reinterpretation of the meaning of a stressful event, while experiential emotion regulation involves an active, non-intervening, accepting, open and welcoming approach of acknowledging awareness of raw sensory affective experiences or ‘experiential awareness’ in a first phase and expression in a second phase. The present study aims to investigate the effects of experiential emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal on the recovery from pre-sleep emotional stress measured by (1) negative affect and (2) sleep structure. Sleep of forty-three healthy Dutch-speaking participants (22 females, 21 males) has been assessed using EEG polysomnography. Stress was triggered using a pre-sleep emotional failure induction, after which emotion regulation by experiential emotion regulation versus cognitive reappraisal versus control was induced twice. The control condition consisted of the reallocation of attention towards the neutral aspects of the emotional event. The results indicated that recovery from negative affect of the failure experience after single or repeated deployment of experiential emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal was not significantly different from the control condition. Moreover, after repeated deployment, sleep physiology did not significantly differ between experiential emotion regulation, cognitive reappraisal, and the control condition in the impact of the regulation of the failure experience. The implications of the distinctive impact of experiential emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal on both the pre-sleep emotional experience and follow-up sleep physiology are discussed.",

This study investigated the relation between the habitual use of different emotion regulation strategies and cortisol reactivity and recovery in healthy control individuals (CTL; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;33) and in individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41). The tendency to worry was associated with increased cortisol reactivity to a stressor across the full sample. Rumination was not associated with cortisol reactivity, despite its oft-reported similarities to worry. Worry and rumination, however, were associated with increased cortisol during recovery from the stressor. The only difference between CTL and SAD participants was observed for reappraisal. In the CTL but not in the SAD group, reappraisal predicted recovery, such that an increased tendency to reappraise was associated with greater cortisol recovery. These results suggest an important role of the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies in understanding biological stress reactivity and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Emotional stress throughout the day is known to affect objective sleep physiology and subjective sleep quality. In the interplay between emotions and sleep, emotion regulation plays a critical role in the recovery from stressful, emotional events and subsequent sleep. While the effects of top-down emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive reappraisal on sleep have been studied before, the impact of bottom-up emotion regulation strategies such as experiential emotion regulation is understudied. Cognitive reappraisal reflects the cognitive reinterpretation of the meaning of a stressful event, while experiential emotion regulation involves an active, non-intervening, accepting, open and welcoming approach of acknowledging awareness of raw sensory affective experiences or 'experiential awareness' in a first phase and expression in a second phase. The present study aims to investigate the effects of experiential emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal on the recovery from pre-sleep emotional stress measured by (1) negative affect and (2) sleep structure. Sleep of forty-three healthy Dutch-speaking participants (22 females, 21 males) has been assessed using EEG polysomnography. Stress was triggered using a pre-sleep emotional failure induction, after which emotion regulation by experiential emotion regulation versus cognitive reappraisal versus control was induced twice. The control condition consisted of the reallocation of attention towards the neutral aspects of the emotional event. The results indicated that recovery from negative affect of the failure experience after single or repeated deployment of experiential emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal was not significantly different from the control condition. Moreover, after repeated deployment, sleep physiology did not significantly differ between experiential emotion regulation, cognitive reappraisal, and the control condition in the impact of the regulation of the failure experience. The implications of the distinctive impact of experiential emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal on both the pre-sleep emotional experience and follow-up sleep physiology are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of emotion by cognitive reappraisal has attracted a lot of attention over the last decade. Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed a wide-spread network of multiple prefrontal and sub-cortical brain regions involved in the successful decrease of negative emotions. However, less is known about the temporal dynamics and the physiological mechanisms underlying these regulation processes. Synchronization of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands plays a key-role in the long-range interaction of different brain regions and oscillatory coupling in the theta frequency range was recently identified to play an important role in the interaction of prefrontal structures, the amygdala and the hippocampus in animal models. Accordingly, we investigated the role of prefrontal theta oscillations during the cognitive reappraisal of aversive pictures in humans. We hypothesized an increase in frontal theta oscillations during emotion regulation and a relationship between frontal theta power and the subjective success of emotion regulation. EEG from 30 healthy participants was recorded while they were asked to passively watch or reappraise the content of pictures with negative content. As expected, we found a significant increase in frequencies around 4Hz at electrode Fz during the regulation condition 'decrease' compared to the 'maintain' condition (p=.006) as well as for the regulation condition 'increase' compared to the 'maintain' condition (p=.017). Additionally, the strength of theta power was positively correlated with the regulation success as reported by the participants (r=0.463, p<.05). The estimation of possible generators of the theta oscillations was done using standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results suggested the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus as a possible generator. The results of the present study are in line with previous findings of fMRI studies suggesting the same regions as part of the regulation network and provide a first direct link between the imaging based knowledge of emotion regulation and a possible physiological mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents significant challenges in early diagnosis and intervention, impacting children and their families. With prevalence rates rising, there is a critical need for accessible and efficient screening tools. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular Temporal Action Localization (TAL), holds promise for automating ASD screening. This paper introduces a self-attention based TAL model designed to identify ASD-related behaviors in infant videos. Unlike existing methods, our approach simplifies complex modeling and emphasizes efficiency, which is essential for practical deployment in real-world scenarios. Importantly, this work underscores the importance of developing computer vision methods capable of operating in naturilistic environments with little equipment control, addressing key challenges in ASD screening. This study is the first to conduct end-to-end temporal action localization in untrimmed videos of infants with ASD, offering promising avenues for early intervention and support. We report baseline results of behavior detection using our TAL model. We achieve 70% accuracy for look face, 79% accuracy for look object, 72% for smile and 65% for vocalization.",

    "abstract": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Little is known, however, about the specific psychological skills that may improve with MBCT. The present study investigated the relationship between history of MBCT and emotion regulation ability. Specifically, we examined cognitive reappraisal ability (CRA) in a sample of individuals with a history of MBCT compared with two control groups: a group without a history of any type of therapy and a group with a history of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Groups were matched on key variables including age, sex, education, working memory, emotional reactivity, and life stress. CRA was measured using a standardized laboratory challenge. Results indicated that participants with a history of MBCT demonstrated higher CRA than both the no-therapy control group and the CBT control group. These results suggest that, by guiding people to accept thoughts and feelings without judgment and to focus on the present moment, MBCT may lay the foundation for increased CRA.",

    "abstract": "This study illuminates the complex relationship between cultural orientation towards collectivism, emotional regulation skills, cognitive reappraisal ability, sports engagement, perceived coach support, and sports self-efficacy in Chinese athletes' performance satisfaction. Seven hundred and fifty athletes from Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Sichuan completed 5-point Likert scale assessments. The study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze variable connections. The results reveal significant relationships between performance satisfaction and cultural orientation towards collectivism (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.35, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), emotional regulation skills (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.28, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001), cognitive reappraisal ability (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.32, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01), sports engagement (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.20, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), perceived coach support (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.25, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01), and self-efficacy in sports (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.30, p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). These findings underscore the importance of psychological factors in shaping athlete well-being and performance satisfaction. These relationships linked the self-determination theory, social support theory, and the transactional model of stress and coping. Treatments that improve athlete self-efficacy, emotional control, and coach-athlete relationships may improve player happiness, retention, and organizational performance. These actions affect management and the economy. A supportive environment and athlete development initiatives may boost athlete well-being and performance, leading to long-term sports success and competitiveness.",

    "abstract": "Negative emotions trigger psychotic symptoms, according to a growing body of evidence. Thus, there is a need for effective emotion regulation in schizophrenia. Reappraisal is an effective, cognitive emotion regulation strategy in healthy individuals. However, it is an open research question whether individuals with schizophrenia have difficulties in successfully applying reappraisal. This study experimentally tests the efficacy of reappraisal compared to distraction in patients with schizophrenia and non-clinical controls. An experimental design with group as between-subject factor (non-clinical controls versus patients with schizophrenia) and emotion regulation during anxiety induction as within-subject factor (reappraisal, distraction, no regulation). Seventeen patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy participants were instructed to respond to anxiety-inducing stimuli by either using reappraisal, distraction or by just watching. Both reappraisal and distraction were effective in down-regulating anxiety, compared to no regulation. The main effect of group and the interaction of emotion regulation condition and group were not significant indicating that the efficacy of both cognitive emotion regulation strategies was independent of group. Patients with schizophrenia are able to apply reappraisal successfully under experimental conditions. Conclusions are limited by the small sample size of this pilot study. Clinical implications for cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Emotions are by nature embodied, as the brain has evolved to quickly assess the emotional significance of stimuli and output signals to the body's viscera and periphery to aid adaptive responses. Emotions involve both implicit bodily and explicit narrative processes, and patients may experience transdiagnostic distress when bodily signals are not attended to and holistically integrated with explicit narratives about experience. Similarly, therapists may be trained in more implicit body-based approaches (i.e., massage/bodywork, physical and occupational therapy, and nursing/medicine) or more explicit narrative-based approaches (i.e., psychotherapy), and may lack training in skills that integrate both levels of emotion processing to aid healing and growth. To address these gaps, we propose a framework where the bridge between implicit bodily sensations and explicit narratives lies in cultivating mindful awareness of bodily sensations associated with emotions. This process brings subjective awareness to notice inner body experience (or interoceptive awareness) that is often outside of conscious awareness, so that it may be understood and re-integrated in more adaptive ways, which we call somatic reappraisal. Using clinical theory and example vignettes, we present mindful interoceptive awareness for adaptive emotion processing as a framework to cultivate and enhance somatic reappraisal. Mindful interoceptive awareness brings more focused and sustained attention to inner body experience; likewise, internal sensations associated with emotions become more granular, vivid, and can shift in ways that facilitate somatic reappraisal. Learning to sustain interoceptive awareness when engaged with mindfulness qualities of nonjudgment and compassion promotes an experience where new associations between emotions, meanings, and memories can be made that generate insights that are holistic and integrative. A clinical vignette is used in this paper to provide examples of this approach in psychotherapy. An example script for use in mindfulness groups is included, and resources are suggested for clinicians to gain more experience. Mindful interoceptive awareness for adaptive emotion processing is a clinical process that can be learned and applied by a range of clinicians to treat mental and physical health conditions that may benefit greater embodied awareness.",

    "abstract": "The tendency for emotions to be predictable over time, labelled emotional inertia, has been linked to low well-being and is thought to reflect impaired emotion regulation. However, almost no studies have examined how emotion regulation relates to emotional inertia. We examined the effects of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression on the inertia of behavioural, subjective and physiological measures of emotion. In Study 1 (N = 111), trait suppression was associated with higher inertia of negative behaviours. We replicated this finding experimentally in Study 2 (N = 186). Furthermore, in Study 2, instructed suppressors and reappraisers both showed higher inertia of positive behaviours, and reappraisers displayed higher inertia of heart rate. Neither suppression nor reappraisal were associated with the inertia of subjective feelings in either study. Thus, the effects of suppression and reappraisal on the temporal dynamics of emotions depend on the valence and emotional response component in question.",

    "abstract": "Within this integrative review, cognitive load theory (CLT) is asserted as a powerful framework for conceptualizing human cognitive processes within learning. The relationship between cognition and emotion is then examined and further integrated within the scope of CLT. Emotion regulation strategies are discussed and adaptive strategies are proposed as being of particular relevance to broadening the theoretical and practical impacts of CLT. Central to the argument of this review is the use of cognitive reappraisal as a potential mitigator of cognitive load. Cognitive reappraisal involves reframing or reassessing understandings or beliefs that underlie an emotional response, which may mitigate cognitive load imposed by maladaptive emotion. It is proposed that effectively integrating adaptive emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive reappraisal in our pursuit of more effective cognitive functioning will aid in the development of a more integrated model of cognition and emotion within CLT.",

    "abstract": "In emotion regulation (ER) research, participants are often trained to use specific strategies in response to emotionally evocative stimuli. Yet theoretical models suggest that people vary significantly in strategy use in everyday life. Which specific strategies people choose to use, and how many, may partially depend on contextual factors like the emotional intensity of the situation. It is thus possible - even likely - that participants spontaneously use uninstructed ER strategies in the laboratory, and that these uninstructed choices may depend on contextual factors like emotional intensity. We report data from four studies in which participants were instructed to use cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions in response to pictures, the emotional intensity of which varied across studies. After the picture trials, participants described which and how many strategies they used by way of open-ended responses. Results indicated that while a substantial proportion of participants in all studies described strategies consistent with cognitive reappraisal, a substantial proportion also endorsed uninstructed strategies. Importantly, they did so more often in the context of studies in which they viewed higher-intensity pictures. These findings underscore the importance of considering uninstructed ER choice in instructed paradigms and situational context in all studies of ER.",

    "abstract": "Emotion regulation dysfunctions are assumed to contribute to the development of tobacco addiction and relapses among smokers attempting to quit. To further examine this hypothesis, the present study compared heavy smokers with non-smokers (NS) in a reappraisal task. Specifically, we investigated whether non-deprived smokers (NDS) and deprived smokers (DS) differ from non-smokers in cognitive emotion regulation and whether there is an association between the outcome of emotion regulation and the cigarette craving. Sixty-five participants (23 non-smokers, 22 NDS, and 20 DS) were instructed to down-regulate emotions by reappraising negative or positive pictorial scenarios. Self-ratings of valence, arousal, and cigarette craving as well as facial electromyography and electroencephalograph activities were measured. Ratings, facial electromyography, and electroencephalograph data indicated that both NDS and DS performed comparably to nonsmokers in regulating emotional responses via reappraisal, irrespective of the valence of pictorial stimuli. Interestingly, changes in cigarette craving were positively associated with regulation of emotional arousal irrespective of emotional valence. These results suggest that heavy smokers are capable to regulate emotion via deliberate reappraisal and smokers' cigarette craving is associated with emotional arousal rather than emotional valence. This study provides preliminary support for the therapeutic use of reappraisal to replace maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies in nicotine addicts.",

A transformational learning program was designed including activities in the classroom as well as outside activities. They incorporated cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of student behaviors, aiming to effectively transform their impulse-buying behaviors. The initial test from the six-week pilot program shows changes in awareness and with some consumption behaviors toward less impulse buying. With a longer time frame in future programs, positive behavioral changes are likely to be more prominent. Implications abound for mindfulness-based transformational learning programs in business education that effect sustainable behaviors of students as our young generation members.",

Using the 1998-2016 Survey of Consumer Finances data, we show that American families have increasingly engaged in financially more intensive parenting but that there are substantial differences by wealth and race-ethnicity. Over time, White families above median wealth accumulate more financial assets and education savings as well as less education debt for children. In contrast, Black and Hispanic families across the wealth distribution have low financial assets and education savings for children. In addition, for Black families across the wealth distribution education debt has grown to substantial amounts. These findings suggest that the contemporary norm of intensive parenting has unequal financial manifestations, which have likely contributed to the widening of wealth and racial inequalities, especially between White and Black child households.",

These findings lead us to argue that curriculum is needed that will permit a careful examination of how everyday citizens can gain knowledge, acknowledge values, and work towards a reasoned and reality-based view of what is at stake with regard to these issues in the 21st Century.

    "abstract": "High levels of student debt can hamper recent graduates as they start their adult lives and careers, influence their choice of job, location, or the decision to pursue further education (Asher 2009). At the same time, student loans are a vital source of financing for students looking to pursue higher education and, if managed appropriately, student loan debt is generally a worthwhile investment that enables individuals to receive the skills and training they need to be competitive in a dynamic global economy. In addition to decisions about paying for higher education, students face other financial choices while in college, such as deciding whether to take on consumer debt as well as selecting and managing transaction account products. As students leave college and transition to the workplace, they are faced with a series of important financial decisions on everything from budgeting to securing health insurance to saving for retirement. Possessing the skills, information, and tools necessary to make effective financial decisions will help to ensure that young people are able to make the right decisions before and after college so that they can begin to build their financial futures. To address these needs, this report has been prepared by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission according to Section 1042 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 and describes the state of financial education among students at covered educational institutions. The report describes current efforts to enhance financial education in a number of institutions with respect to student understanding of financial aid, along with other financial education topics at two critical junctures: (1) Choosing Where to Go and How to Finance Postsecondary Education; and (2) Making Sound Financial Decisions When Enrolled and Beyond.

However, the financial demands placed on individuals today include much more complicated matters, such as buying a home and saving for retirement. Furthermore, financial literacy gives rise to normative questions such as what responsibility should be placed on individuals. In educational terms, this creates an alignment problem where the hopes and expectations placed in financial literacy as mass-education is not met by desirable results. This article uses previous results and the construct of powerful knowledge to discuss how financial literacy education in upper secondary school can benefit from an incorporation into social studies, which is an existing school subject in many educational systems. Findings include that teachers can utilize their existing teaching competence to also teach financial literacy. However, to accomplish results, both curricula and syllabi must guide teachers to abandon the focus on money management to instead focus on teaching students concerning the financial, economic and political issues that affect personal finances, yet at the same time can be affected by democratic decisions. Implications for financial literacy teaching and learning are discussed using the concept Powerful Financial Literacy.",

After controlling for self-selection bias through propensity score matching, the findings show that receiving financial advice is associated positively with the likelihood of saving for children's college education. Other findings reveal that seeking specific types of financial advice relating to savings/investment, insurance, and tax planning is positively associated with a household's decision to allocate money for their children's postsecondary education. The ensuing discussion highlights that policies incentivizing households to seek financial advice could promote college savings and contribute to reduction in student loan dependence.",

Further, regression analyses highlighted differences between predictors of perceived financial well-being and more and less frequent money saving behaviors, which may indicate different paths for intervention. Specifically, students reporting engaging in less common financial strain behaviors appear to have more objective financial difficulties, whereas students reporting more common financial strain behaviors report more factors that suggest difficulty with money management skills and those with lower levels of perceived financial well-being report higher levels of worry. Mediational analyses further indicated a potential role for parental intervention to improve perceived financial well-being and decrease unhealthy responses to financial strain.",

    "abstract": "Due to the increased financial pressure--exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic--that students in higher education need to endure, considerable attention is being drawn towards the determinants of student financial anxiety. A conflicting picture has been captured about financial literacy, which has been shown to either be associated with better financial well-being or to be unrelated to financial stress. While discerning between financial knowledge ('objective' financial literacy) and perceived ability to manage personal finances ('subjective' financial literacy), this study also explores the impact that students' attitudes towards debt may exert on their financial anxiety. In a sample of 174 university students from the UK, we measured students' financial anxiety, objective and subjective financial literacy, attitudes towards debt and perceived impact of COVID-19 on financial behaviour. Bayesian analyses revealed that only attitudes towards debt and perception of the impact of the pandemic predicted students' financial anxiety. While the evidence in regard to financial literacy was inconclusive, mediation analyses showed that objective financial literacy indirectly impacted financial anxiety by increasing fear of debt. The findings suggest that students' financial anxiety may be reduced by adopting strategies that focus on the subjective perception of debt and of economic circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Occupational therapy students face professional and personal financial literacy challenges. Professionally, financial management has been identified as an instrumental activity of daily living, and recent research has examined how occupational therapy has helped clients with these skills. Personally, occupational therapy students may face higher debt levels due to degree escalation and economic changes. The study aimed to determine the level of understanding of financial literacy among matriculating occupational therapy students in a combined baccalaureate and entry-level master's program. Nineteen occupational therapy students completed a virtual survey distributed through Google Forms. The survey included demographic questions, the Financial Self-Efficacy Scale (FSES), and a 16-question survey about financial habits and knowledge from open-sourced questions. Descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS version 29. Results showed that most students had a general understanding of financial literacy, but they could not correctly apply the concepts to real-life questions. The overall mean for the FSES was 13.05 (SD = 4.28). For financial habits, most students reported they did not have an emergency fund or a budget but had checked their credit scores. Most students responded incorrectly or were unsure about most financial knowledge questions. No one answered all the financial knowledge questions correctly. Financial literacy is needed in occupational therapy education to prepare students to transition with skills that will benefit clients and themselves.",

    "abstract": "Student loans are likely to remain a prominent instrument for paying for college in Texas, a necessary financial tool for low- and moderate-income students. As college costs rise and growing enrollments further stretch grant funds, the policy challenge is to assist students in determining the appropriate level of student loans for their individual situation. The process begins with quality college outreach services to high school students. Financial literacy training can help students manage their finances and plan their careers wisely, providing reasonable loan debt and salary expectations. Professional, qualified loan counseling can help students better understand their loan obligations, and a neutral party can advocate on behalf of students and provide essential delinquency and default prevention services to keep them in repayment. Although they carry some risk, student loans are a necessary tool for promoting college access and success, allowing students to enroll full time and work a minimum number of hours. This can enhance the quality of the educational experience and reduce the number of years to degree, saving money for both the student and the state.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and risk-taking behavior in the stock market for both graduates and undergraduates. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted two surveys on two groups: graduates and undergraduates. The questionnaires were sent to the two groups via &quot;Google Form&quot;. The surveys were undertaken from March to October 2021, with final data on 500 undergraduates and 400 graduates. The three techniques used are multiple linear regression (MLR), structural equation model (SEM) and ordinal logit regression (OLR) to examine the causal relationships. Findings: Based on survey data on 400 graduate and 500 undergraduate students, our results show that financial literacy is positively associated with risk-taking behavior (i.e. use of debt and willingness to use debt) after controlling for demographics. Graduates with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to use debt. Undergraduates with higher levels of financial literacy are more willing to use debt. In addition, parental education has a significant moderating effect on the association between financial literacy and debt use among undergraduate students. The results are robust compared to the alternatives. Research limitations/implications: Although this study finds a positive association between financial literacy and risk-taking behavior among graduates and undergraduates, and these results are robust to the alternatives, the scope of this study is limited and only focuses on Vietnam. Hence, it needs to be expanded overseas. Next, graduates may make investment decisions based on stock prices or valuations, and as a result, the link between financial literacy and stock valuations should be investigated in subsequent research. Last but not least, further studies should also examine the digital financial literacy level of the younger generation, as it plays an important role in the digital age. Practical implications: First, this study finds that higher financial literacy tends to use more debt, implying that financially literate people know how to use debt smartly to earn more profits. Second, students with higher-educated parents are less likely to use debt for stock investment, meaning that parents help students avoid possible risks while in the university. Finally, female graduates and college students all perform lower in financial literacy than their male counterparts. This can create a larger gender gap in financial literacy between women and men, particularly, in a society in which men often play the leading role in the family. As a result, it calls for policymakers, educators and parents to pay more attention to improving financial literacy among girls and women in general. Originality/value: This study has three contributions. First, this is the first study to examine the impact of financial literacy on risk-taking behavior between two groups of graduates and undergraduates. The results show that individuals with a higher level of financial literacy are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior (i.e. debt use) in terms of the stock market. Recent research, for example, Phung et al. (2022), examines investors' informal debt (from families and friends), while this study investigates graduates' debt use (from brokerage firms). Second, parental education is a significant mediator between college students' financial literacy and debt use. The literature on parental socialization mainly documents parents' direct influence on children's financial knowledge and performance (Shim et al., 2010; Phung, 2023). Unlike previous research, this study finds that parental education plays a moderating role between college students' financial literacy and their risk-taking behavior. Finally, three methods and multiple models are used to test causal relationships. The results are robust compared to the alternatives.",

    "abstract": "University students and university personnel are important contributors to the economy of the United States regarding excessive student loan debt. As such, a lack of financial literacy is a significant problem. The purpose of this single descriptive qualitative case study was to describe the experiences of certain individual university students about their financial knowledge of their student loan debt. Bandura's social learning theory and Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory was used to analyze the results of this study. The research questions asked how university students describe their experiences regarding student loan debt and their financial acuity, and how do university students' parents describe their experiences with student loan debt? This study examined students' perceptions and experiences regarding financial literacy and money management related to student loan debt. Data for this study included interviews with 10 borrowers, one college financial counselor, field notes, observations of information available to students on student loans, reviewed reports, and personal journals or diaries on their debt. Open and axial coding revealed five themes: (a) financial skills, (b) budgeting, (c) initial debt, (d) benefits, and (e)challenges. This study could contribute to social change by persuading the implementation of financial literacy training through independent courses or by incorporating lessons into the core curriculum in institutions - similar to this one but using financial knowledge of student loan debt. The study could contribute to financial change by helping university students acknowledge financial challenges; they may alleviate stress and reclaim control of their financial knowledge of student debt and personal lives.

    "abstract": "The lack of basic financial knowledge and skills among youth today is of national concern. American high school students routinely fail tests that evaluate their financial knowledge and are ill-prepared to face important decisions about borrowing, saving, investing, and planning for their financial futures. The consequences of these low levels of financial literacy can be significant. Low financial literacy is correlated with a host of negative credit behaviors, including higher borrowing rates, mortgage delinquency, and home foreclosure. Financial literacy also influences important decisions about education. Youth with no savings account are less likely to attend college, and for those in college, financial stress and credit card debt have been tied to an increased likelihood of missing class and dropping out. States have a vested interest in the economic health of their citizens, making low financial literacy an important issue for policymakers. Public education before high school graduation can play a role in improving financial literacy and promoting sound financial decision-making. Yet many--if not most--financial education efforts focus on college students and adults. Such efforts are often reactive rather than proactive, and may be too little too late. In contrast, earlier education initiatives during and before high school can target individuals before they have had the opportunity to get into serious financial trouble and become entrenched in negative behaviors. Research suggests that introducing children and adolescents to general concepts, such as responsible spending and good saving habits, may pay dividends later in life by establishing the building blocks for financial well-being in adulthood. This review first presents a holistic framework of financial literacy that reflects the various ways it has been defined by researchers and practitioners. It then examines state efforts to incorporate financial literacy education into their K-12 standards, mandates, and curricula, and review research on the effectiveness of these policies on student outcomes. Finally, the authors highlight a number of financial education organizations, programs and resources--both public and private--that have had positive impact on K-12 students, and describe their design and influence.",

    "abstract": "For students with a significant amount of student loan debt, the excitement of graduating from college can be overshadowed by feelings of anxiety and fear. Debt perception is about more than the cost of a college degree, the amount of financial aid received, or the value families place on education. In this article, the author tells a story about David, a student, who graduated from college with more than $85,000 of student loan debt. He uses this story to define debt perception as, a psychological attitude based on an individual's history and beliefs around money and debt influenced by the values and habits of families and the characteristics of the communities where they grew up. The author goes into detail about the concept of financial literacy, which is often thought of as an individual or family responsibility, however, individuals and families, especially people of color or those from low-income households, may not have the ability or resources to teach financial literacy. All these points are detailed through following David's story of his goal of seeking higher education.",

    "abstract": "As the funding environment for higher education and theological education changes, an increasing number of graduate theological students hold student loan debt that will follow them well into their postgraduation working lives (Delisle, 2014). This study reports the attitudes about money voiced by master of divinity students at one mainline Protestant seminary. Using interactive qualitative analysis, researchers discovered seven key themes that function as a conceptual system (mind map). Participants reported that the three themes that exerted the most influence in the system were beliefs (how money fits in with other convictions held by students), societal impact (what students think about the results of government policies and actions of private firms regarding money), and financial awareness (how students know about their income, expenses, and obligations). These themes influenced what students thought about debt, saving, giving money away, and their emotions about money. Most participants voiced explicitly theological beliefs about money, including a variety of reasons for their own giving. The article discusses these findings in relation to other research about student debt and Christian attitudes toward financial giving. Recommendations arising from these findings include providing explicit curricular attention in theological schools to money as a problem for Christians and to developing students' financial literacy. Theological schools may benefit from exploring the relationship between the institutional need to admit tuition-paying students and the needs of churches for full-time pastors. Areas for further research include the relationship between a sense of Christian vocation and money, as well as what, if anything, is distinctive about donating money to explicitly Christian organizations.",

A survey research design was used for the study. The study was carried out in the North-west zone of Nigeria. The population of the study was 219 Business Education Lecturers in 10 Colleges of Education. The entire population was studied since it was small and manageable. Two research questions were answered and one null hypothesis was tested at 0.05 level of significance and 202 degrees of freedom. A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data for the study. The questionnaire items were structured on a 5-point Likert scale. A total of 204 copies of the questionnaire were retrieved from the respondents for analysis. The data collected were analyzed using Mean statistic to answer the research questions, while analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that all the items of retail store location and design were accepted by the respondents as having influence on the impulse buying behaviour of consumers. The findings also revealed that there was no significant difference in the Mean responses of Business Education Lecturers with regards to their ranks on the influence on all the retail store items on consumer impulse buying behaviour. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended, among others, that retailers should adopt the retail store variables identified in this study in order to boost their trade and provide a satisfying shopping experience for their customers.",

Those surveyed exhibit low credit card usage and responsible payment practices. Most never use credit to pay medical expenses. Respondents display a financial literacy level similar to the Jump$tart Coalition's 2008 college sample. While the financial situations and well-being for most are positive, those with financial pressures face some negative outcomes. Increasing financial literacy and teaching basic budgeting to a targeted segment of older adults have the potential to increase well-being and family relationships.",

    "abstract": "For many people in the United States, college paves the way to the middle class. Programs like Pell Grants and government backed loans help students afford a college degree. These programs help young Americans gain the skills they need to get a good job. But too many Ohioans struggle to afford college and pay back student loans. The Trump administration's budget proposal and the resolution passed by the House Budget Committee dismantle key college access and affordability programs. Both proposals slash Pell Grants, the most important source of need-based aid for students. The proposals also cut interest-free loans for undergraduate students in school, and eliminate some debt relief programs. These programs ensure that college is attainable for low- and middle-income Ohioans. Every year hundreds of thousands of working-class students attending Ohio public and private universities use these programs to make college more affordable. Ohio is one of the worst states in the nation in student debt burden. These cuts will force Ohioans to take on even more debt to get a degree--making our communities and economies less competitive. The House Budget Resolution sets Congressional funding priorities for the next 10 years. It calls for massive giveaways to the wealthy and corporations and deep cuts to programs that pay for college. Members of the Budget Committee voted to slash $236 billion in mandatory education spending. They targeted programs that help the most people afford college: Pell Grants, subsidized loans, income-based repayment plans, and public service loan forgiveness. This report examines the programs and makes recommendations how Congressional representatives can protect student financial aid and debt relief programs.

    "abstract": "Background/purpose: Financial literacy is essential for adolescents navigating complex digital finance. However, gaps persist due to inconsistent formal education, varied parental influence, and uncritical digital exposure. This study explores the financial education experiences, financial management behaviors, and digital financial misconceptions of high school students using a qualitative phenomenological approach. Materials/methods: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with three students and their parents and analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: The findings reveal that financial information obtained through social media was found to be more dominant than that from formal school curricula. Students exhibited impulsive spending behaviors, limited understanding of digital financial risks, and varied financial decisions influenced by family norms. Parental involvement emerged as a crucial factor in shaping students' financial attitudes and behaviors. This study contributes to the field by proposing an integrative literacy framework that connects formal education, parental guidance, and digital financial realities to better prepare youth for informed decision-making in an increasingly digital economy. Conclusion: This study highlights that while formal, informal, and non-formal financial education positively impact students' financial literacy, gaps remain due to limited school education and varying parental guidance. Social media and digital platforms are major financial learning sources for Generation Z, but they also introduce risks of digital financial misconceptions. Students face challenges in financial management, such as poor record-keeping, inadequate saving, and impulse spending. Misunderstandings about digital transactions, along with rising online fraud, further complicate financial decisions. Parental involvement is crucial for financial independence, and family well-being is tied to financial stability and communication. The study calls for a comprehensive financial literacy program that combines formal education, parental involvement, and digital financial risk awareness to promote responsible financial behaviors among high school students.",

    "abstract": "This qualitative phenomenological study engaged 20 young, low-income credit union members who participated in financial education classes at Denver Community Credit Union. The study explored learning experiences that generated changes in money management behaviors and sought evidence of transformational learning in a nonformal education setting. Themes from participants' interview answers appear under three core themes and seventeen sub-themes. Core theme 1: Indicators of money-management behaviors: five sub-themes included: examine and plan savings habits, track spending habits and rethink before buying, learn how credit works, learn how to pay off credit, and avoid adding new credit. Core theme 2: Steps in transformational learning: six sub-themes included: experienced dilemmas resulting from high debt and low income, accomplishment via experiencing improved money management habits, inform, write about, and discuss money issues, identify irresponsible and out of control financial habits, become confident and self-accountable, and positioned to lead others. Core theme 3: Perceived transformational learning: six sub-themes included improved self-awareness and financial control, experienced dilemmas resulting from loss of income and high debt, experienced discontent with lack of knowledge, experienced discontent with unclear goals, experienced discontent with unmanaged credit, and plan spending, budget, and then act. Young, low-income credit union members changed their money management behaviors and experienced transformational learning as a result of their financial education experience at Denver Community Credit Union. A set of teaching/learning sequences are proposed and explained. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "abstract": "In this letter, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) responds to questions about the effects of President Biden's August 24, 2022, announcement on executive actions affecting student loans. The cost of outstanding student loans will increase by $20 billion because an action suspended payments, interest accrual, and involuntary collections from September 2022 to December 2022, the CBO estimates. After accounting for those suspensions, CBO estimates that the cost of student loans will increase by about an additional $400 billion in present value as a result of the action canceling up to $10,000 of debt issued on or before June 30, 2022, for borrowers with income below specified limits and an additional $10,000 for such borrowers who also received at least one Pell grant. The cost of debt cancellation is the present value of the borrowers' projected repayments of student debt before accounting for the cancellation minus the present value of repayments after doing so. CBO's estimates are highly uncertain. The most uncertain components are the projections of how much borrowers would repay if the executive action canceling debt had not been undertaken and how much they will repay under that executive action. Those projections depend in part on future economic conditions and on how the terms of loans might be modified in the future.",

It works from a conceptual model that predicts that attitudes will be partly determined by a range of social factors, mediated through personality and 'financial literacy'. Path analysis is used to explore this model. The proposed model was found to be basically sound, with some notable negative findings. Socio-economic status was found to have a negligible role in determining debt attitudes, while the role of financial literacy was limited to reducing the likelihood of seeing debt as useful for lifestyle expenditure. Debt anxiety was found to be higher among students with a general predisposition to anxiety and inversely related to viewing student debt as a form of educational investment. It is concluded that student debt attitudes are multidimensional and individualised, challenging simplistic ideas of debt aversion in earlier literature.",

    "abstract": "College has never been so necessary or so expensive for Americans. Rising costs, state disinvestment, declining household incomes, and grant aid that has not kept pace lead more students to borrow, and borrow more, to go to school. While federal student loans are the safest option for students who need to borrow, rising student loan debt has repercussions for both individuals and the broader economy. In addition to the severe consequences for those who default, student loan debt--even low debt when paired with low earnings--can hold borrowers back from starting a family, buying a home, saving for retirement, starting a business or farm, or saving for their own children's education. While not a solution for rising costs or debt, income-driven repayment (IDR) for federal student loans gained broad support over a decade ago from lenders, students, schools, and both Republicans and Democrats. Since Congress passed the first widely available plan in 2007, IDR has become an increasingly critical option for students who have to borrow to afford college, and it continues to have strong bipartisan support. IDR plans now help millions of borrowers stay on top of their loans and avoid default, providing the assurance of manageable monthly payments tied to their income and family size, as well as a light at the end of the tunnel so that student loan payments do not last the rest of their lives. In addition to providing repayment relief to borrowers struggling with low incomes relative to their debt, the availability of more affordable payments through IDR can help allay well-documented fears about college costs and debt that keep some students from ever attempting college and push others to drop out before completing. However, the range of IDR plans available today--five of them, each with varying eligibility requirements, costs, and benefits--is confusing and contributes to under-enrollment among the borrowers who may need IDR the most. To better serve both borrowers and taxpayers, IDR must be both streamlined and improved. Needed improvements include simplifying the annual income recertification process in IDR, better targeting the benefits of IDR, and preventing forgiven debt in IDR from being treated as taxable income. This report details a proposal to streamline the multiple IDR plans into one improved plan that caps monthly payments at 10% of income, provides tax-free loan forgiveness after 20 years of payments, targets benefits to borrowers who need help the most, and prevents borrowers with high incomes and high debt from receiving loan forgiveness when they could have afforded to pay more.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have focused heavily on the astronomical student loan debt number in the United States of America and the overall expense of higher education; however, few studies have focused on the financial literacy of higher education students and what financial knowledge the individuals possess who were key members of the community who were adding to the overall student loan debt number. The purpose of this study was to examine the mindset of higher education graduates from public universities within the last 10 years (2012-2022) about factors that have contributed to the overall student loan debt number in the United States with a specific focus on the financial literacy of these students. Specific research questions were developed to study college graduates and their financial thought processes on selecting their college, payment plan, major, and financial repercussions of these decisions. I utilized the snowball and convenience sampling methods in this qualitative study to obtain 14 research participants who graduated from public universities between 2012-2022 to personally interview about their financial literacy, knowledge, habits, and influences in high school, during their higher education journey, and post-graduation. The data analysis showed individuals were more aware of the cost of college and student loan debt than previous research conducted. Multiple things played into this, such as parental influence and self-awareness. Implications of these findings and recommendations for further research were discussed.

    "abstract": "In the wake of the deep recession of 2008 and 2009, there has been increased concern over the current level of financial literacy among American citizens. For many, this concern extends to our college students getting ready to enter the real world as they leave college life behind. This study looks at the preparedness of college students to manage their financial affairs both as young adults and as citizens able to effectively plan for typical life-changing events. This body of knowledge usually includes a solid understanding of investing, insurance, risk, credit, debt, buying a home, retirement planning, wills and living wills, and cash management. The focus of this study was undergraduates at two smaller private higher education institutions in New England and a public community college in South Carolina. This study evaluated the financial literacy skills of college students as measured by a well-regarded questionnaire developed and used by the Jump$tart coalition. The study quantified the financial literacy of students at the three institutions, and looked for statistically significant differences based on gender, age, college major, and first-generation college students. Few differences were found among these categories. There was not a statistically significant difference in financial literacy between men and women. Age was a factor in financial literacy, but not a major one. Business and STEM majors outperformed other majors, but the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, no difference was found in the scores of first generation students versus non first generation. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

This study employed an exploratory sequential design in which quantitative data from a survey was collected first, followed by the collection of qualitative data from participant interviews to study occupational therapy graduates who accrued more than $100,000 in student loan debt. Forty-four occupational therapy graduates from Creighton University completed a survey asking questions about personal choices in relation to debt. Of these respondents, 20 completed a follow-up semi-structured interview. Six themes related to the effect of debt on personal lives emerged from the interviews, including: 1) mental health, 2) future purchasing power, 3) relationships, 4) maintaining life work balance, 5) frugality, and 6) financial literacy. Four themes related to effect of debt on professional lives were: 1) job limitations, 2) stuck, 3) career choice, and 4) salary dissonance. Future research should further examine how programs can address these concerns to promote student and practitioner well-being.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between financial literacy and financial behaviors among various age groups. Financial literacy was measured in three ways: objective financial knowledge, subjective financial knowledge or confidence, and subjective financial management ability. The age groups were 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65 and older. Long-term financial behavior referred to retirement saving and investing behavior, whereas short-term financial behavior referred to spending and emergency saving behavior. In the full sample, both objective and subjective financial literacy variables were positively associated with long- and short-term financial behaviors. In the age subsamples, subjective financial knowledge or confidence was more strongly related to long- and short-term financial behavior than either objective financial knowledge or subjective financial management ability in the younger age groups. In the older age groups, objective financial knowledge was more strongly related to long-term financial behavior than either of the other two measures of financial literacy.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses adults who are dealing with limited financial means under the premises of disability and over-indebtedness. To this end, the authors examined the concepts of vulnerability, financial literacy and the numerate environment for systematising and presenting findings from a qualitative secondary analysis of qualitative data sets derived from two research projects, having explored the numeracy practices of adults with learning difficulties and of adults facing overindebtedness. By this, the learner's micro level of acting out numeracy is brought to the fore, revealing the multidimensional features of a numerate environment and of adults' numeracy strategies in order to handle financial matters in daily life. The analysis identified the common ground of the most significant competency domains of financial literacy according to both data sets (revenues, expenses and consumption, and budget management) and identified the numeracy strategies developed and used. In conclusion, the authors suggest further discussion of vulnerability as a relative and relational category that supports a pedagogical understanding of adult basic education and adult numeracy with a resource-oriented perspective.",

    "abstract": "The rising costs of college attendance and changes in financial aid packages leave students with little option other than to incur a debt of some amount. Unfortunately, colleges often fail to provide adequate financial literacy and student loan information so prospective students planning to attend college can make informed decisions. Student loans may seem attractive in the short term because, unlike other loans, repayment does not begin immediately. However, the accrual of student loan debt leads to long-term financial consequences, including the opportunity to build economic wealth after graduation. Utilizing a basic qualitative research design, I explored first-generation community college students' experiences with financial aid, financial literacy, and the challenges and individual circumstances of using student loans to fund expenses related to their postsecondary enrollment. A human capital framework supported students informed financial decision-making experiences to effectively persist confidently in pursuing their educational goals. Collectively, students' detailed statements provided a powerful voice for first-generation students accessing financial resources at the community college. The six themes included (a) Student-Centered, (b) Understanding Consequences of Student Loans, (c) Development of Financial Aid Literacy, (d) Student-Connection, (e) Simplifying Financial Aid Access for Students, and (f) Support From Campus-Based Programs. Findings provide helpful insights for community college practitioners and financial aid administrators. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "abstract": "With rising personal and public debt, public and private employers increasingly shifting financial responsibility to individuals, and an increase in both the number of financial investment options and predatory lending practices, today's students need to be financially literate. This paper defines financial literacy and justifies its place in the mathematics curriculum. After describing the gaps in young people's understanding of financial literacy, which is more pronounced among women and minorities, this paper provides examples of financial literacy exercises. College students' solutions demonstrated that the level of financial literacy is low. The majority of students were unfamiliar with financial principles and concepts. Students found it difficult to estimate answers and judge the reasonableness of their solutions. Reading comprehension and general cognitive skills led students to incorrect answers. The difficulties students had reinforce the need for financial education and developing students' general cognitive skills.",

We determined the equation of best fit between PA and TEE and explored relationships between PA and behavioral and physiological compensation. Using linear and nonlinear modeling, we observed a positive linear relationship between PA and TEE either without or after adjustment for fat-free mass (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.3492, TEE = 0.00685*PA + 7.124: R<sup>2</sup>=0.3667, TEE_ADJ(FFM) = 0.00511*PA + 8.598). Higher PA was associated with lower sedentary time (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.7207, %SPA= -0.0211*X + 91.261). There was no association between PA, TEE, or resting metabolic rate and adjusted biomarkers of immune, reproductive, or thyroid function after Bonferroni correction. The findings of this observational study do not support the constrained/compensated model but affirm the conventional additive relationship between PA and TEE across a broad range of PA levels.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we summarise recent developments, identify gaps, and propose a research agenda for quantitative health impact assessment (HIA) of environmental exposures linked to urban transport and land use. This is based on a workshop of 30 experts, complemented by targeted literature identified by participants to illustrate the state of research and practice gaps. The practice of quantitative HIA in urban transport and land use interventions covers a diverse range of methods, models, and frameworks. The selection of an appropriate model depends upon the use case, i.e., the research question, resources and expertise, and application. The plurality of models can be a strength if differences are explicit and their implications are understood. A major gap in most assessments and frameworks is the lack of equity consideration. This should be integrated into all stages of the HIA, considering exposures, susceptibility, disease burden, capacity to benefit, household budgets, responsibility for harm, and participation in the process. Scenarios of environmental exposures in urban transport and land use interventions are often overly simple, while the scenario design process of spatial planning is often opaque. Researchers should specify the involvement of stakeholders and the data, evidence, or behavioural model used to construct the scenario. Recent developments in exposure assessment (remote sensing and modelling) have increased the capacity to conduct HIAs for small geographies at scale. At the same time, advances in simulation have enabled the representation of behaviours at high spatial and temporal resolution. The combination can enable person-centric measures accounting for location, activities, and behaviours, with HIA proceeding ahead of epidemiology. Most HIAs still use Comparative Risk Assessment. This is suitable for estimating the disease burdens of environmental exposures, but more advanced longitudinal methods are better suited for studying interventions. Beyond health outcomes, well-being must be incorporated. The monetisation of health outcomes through welfare economics remains contentious. Representation of uncertainty is increasingly acknowledged. Value of Information methods can inform where new data collection would most efficiently reduce final result uncertainty. In the context of the climate crisis and related environmental limits, methods are needed that consider adaptation alongside mitigation and prevention and test robustness to an increasingly unstable future.",

The certainty of evidence of these ILCOR treatment recommendations was used to issue the ERC Guidelines 2025 Recommendations. In some cases, the ERC made good practice statements when evidence was absent for certain topics. If no ILCOR review was available, the ERC writing groups conducted their own reviews to provide recommendations. The ERC Guidelines 2025 cover the epidemiology of cardiac arrest, the role that systems play in saving lives, adult basic life support, adult advanced life support, resuscitation in special circumstances, post resuscitation care, newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth, paediatric basic and advanced life support, resuscitation ethics, education for resuscitation, and first aid. These guidelines are a framework of recommendations for the approach to out-of-hospital and in-hospital resuscitation; the implementation is achieved locally taking local legislation and health care regulations into consideration.",

For a subset of these (botulism and diphtheria antitoxins and, until 2022, intravenous artesunate for severe malaria), distribution is coordinated through CDC port health stations (PHS), located mainly at major US international airports. CDC aims for these drugs to reach their destinations within 8&#xa0;hours of release authorization. We analyzed CDC records to identify areas for efficiency improvement. We queried records detailing drug distributions from PHS that occurred May 2006 to February 2024, including timing of release authorization and delivery, geographic origins and destinations, mode of transportation, and patient characteristics and outcomes. We conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses to identify variables that may have delayed delivery. CDC port health stations. Time from release authorization to drug delivery. CDC PHS distributed 2912 drug shipments between May 2006 and February 2024 via 17 distribution sites to 54 jurisdictions across the US and 3 countries. Of 850 shipments for which data were available (those occurring December 2019 or later), 83% (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;702/850) occurred within 8 hours of authorization. Commercial air transport (compared to other types of transport) (aOR: 11.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.94-18.81, P &lt;&#xa0;.001) and release authorization time (outside of vs within routine work hours) (aOR: 5.10, 95% CI: 3.31-7.86, P &lt;&#xa0;.001) were significantly associated with delays. CDC PHS facilitated emergency distributions of life-saving drugs for botulism, diphtheria, and severe malaria to locations throughout the US mostly within 8&#xa0;hours of authorization. Staffing, distribution locations, and expanded options for ground transportation are important considerations that may minimize delays.",

    "abstract": "The dual vascular inflow of liver grafts in liver transplantation (LT) is increasingly recognized as crucial to achieving adequate graft function in deceased donor LT (DDLT). Portal hyperperfusion is the most common, leading to decreased intrahepatic adenosine and arterial vasoconstriction via the hepatic artery buffer response. Splanchnic vasodilators, splenic artery embolization, or splenectomy are all recognized among other treatments. However, the management of portal hypoperfusion is less well described, with only isolated case reports describing the augmentation of portal venous (PV) inflow. This is the largest series describing PV arterialization as a strategy to save liver grafts by bolstering portal inflow. Patients at a single transplant center (Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, UAE) were included (2018-2024). Intra-operative portal vein and hepatic artery flows are measured in all cases using a MediStim vascular flow device, and liver-vascular ultrasounds are obtained routinely post-transplant. Surgical PV arterialization is used as a short-term measure when adequate portal vein flow cannot be achieved using conventional techniques. Cases were performed using end-to-side anastomosis of a cadaveric iliac artery graft from the recipient infra-renal aorta (n = 3) to the recipient PV as an additional inflow in Y-configuration or using a conduit from the donor splenic artery to the donor PV (end-to-side) with the standard PV-anastomosis also functioning. Four patients were deemed to have inadequate portal flow in the early post-LT (range POD1-7, n = 3) or intra-operative (n = 1) periods. All patients had laboratory and/or visual evidence of inadequate liver function secondary to portal hypoperfusion at the time of the decision to pursue arterialization. PV flows before arterialization were 500-590&#xa0;mL/min [31-39&#xa0;mL/min/100&#xa0;g] and 1.4-2&#xa0;L/min [93-133&#xa0;mL/min/100&#xa0;g] after arterialization. Arterialization grafts (n = 3) were ligated on post-arterialization days 2-7. At the conclusion of modulation, PV flows were 1.1-2.3&#xa0;L/min [73-147&#xa0;mL/min/100&#xa0;g] with maintained HA flows 120-495&#xa0;mL/min, highlighting the relative adaptability of liver graft and PV compliance after augmentation. All four patients are symptom-free with intact liver graft function at a range of 6-18 months post-LT. Graft survival of 100% compares favorably to all-comers after LT in the same setting (1-year GS = 96%, log-rank p = 0.874). Arterialization of the portal vein is a viable and graft-saving strategy for PV hypoperfusion in LT. Surgeons may pursue this approach in the scenario of inadequate portal vein perfusion without other identifiable causes, such as PV thrombus or port-systemic shunts, with a plan for arterial shunt reversal 1-7 days after placement based on flow assessment.",

    "abstract": "the global trend of emerging and re-emerging diseases has highlighted surveillance as a fundamental pillar in ensuring global health security. The Gambia undertook a surveillance system assessment as part of a structured approach for surveillance system strengthening. We describe the best practices, key gaps, and critically analyse the system's capacity to collect complete, timely, and accurate data and the use of data for meaningful decision making. we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to assess both core and supporting surveillance functions. A total of 74 public and private health facilities, comprising 16 hospitals and 58 primary health care facilities from rural and urban settings, were randomly sampled from a sampling frame of 195 facilities. Data were collected by MoH staff from both central and regional levels with support from officers from the WHO Country Office. Frequency distribution tables were prepared, and proportions were calculated, stratified by region and health facility levels. national surveillance guidelines were available in 66% of the health facilities. Standard case definitions for priority diseases were present in 91% of the health facilities. More than half (66%) of the health facilities could handle specimens until shipment. Overall, 20%, 32% and 42% of the health facilities analysed data by person, place, and time, respectively. All regions had demonstrated the capacity to transport samples to a higher-level laboratory. At the central level, there was no budget line for surveillance or epidemic response. investments in emergency preparedness and response mechanisms, building workforce capacity, and strengthening sample collection and transportation were evident. However, gaps remain in data analysis, implementation of eIDSR, and preparedness planning. Improving coordination, securing sustainable funding mechanisms, and implementation of EBS and CBS present key opportunities for system improvement.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things requires frameworks that ensure secure processing, computational efficiency, and scalability for continuous healthcare data streams. Existing solutions remain limited in their ability to support real-time anomaly detection, resource-constrained optimization, and multi-tier aggregation in large-scale deployments. This work proposes an Adaptive Federated Edge Learning framework specifically designed for healthcare systems enabled by the Internet of Medical Things. The framework incorporates Adaptive Modular Learning Units that allocate computations according to device-specific resource budgets and update models through federated gradient descent. Dynamic Data Encoding transforms heterogeneous medical data into a unified and decorrelated feature representation with alignment and quality weighting to preserve consistency across distributed sources. A Hierarchical Federated Aggregation mechanism performs device, regional, and global parameter updates using data-size weighting and delay-aware factors to maintain training stability and scalability in heterogeneous network environments. Privacy-Preserving Secure Enclaves provide encrypted model training and aggregation with differential privacy noise injection, ensuring that sensitive clinical data remain protected throughout the learning cycle. Real-time anomaly detection is achieved through a streaming pipeline based on sliding windows, dimensionality reduction, covariance analysis, and adaptive thresholding with context-aware clustering. Experimental evaluation using clinical datasets and simulated Internet of Medical Things environments demonstrated that the framework achieved 96.3% accuracy in controlled conditions and sustained 110&#xa0;ms latency in streaming anomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the time to surgery for patients requiring cholecystectomy may lessen the risk of adverse outcomes. Dedicated day-surgery lists supported by out-of-hospital remote monitoring have been explored as a potential solution; however, the cost-effectiveness of such innovative care models remains largely unexplored. This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing an acute day-surgery care model with remote patient monitoring to a conventional inpatient-centric care model for high-acuity cases of cholecystitis. Post-surgical complications, effectiveness (measured by bed days saved and quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and health care costs associated with the two models of care were compared over a 1-year time horizon using a decision tree model. Health care costs were estimated from the Australian health care funder perspective and expressed in 2023 Australian dollars. Uncertainty was assessed using both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The acute day-surgery care model dominated the conventional inpatient-centric care model by saving a mean of 1.7 inpatient days per patient (3.2 days for the conventional model versus 1.5 days for the acute day-surgery model) and lowering net health care costs by a mean of AU $1,416 (US $935) per case over the 1-year time horizon. There was no meaningful difference in QALYs between the care models. These results remained robust in both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. An acute day-surgery care model with remote patient monitoring for individuals with acute cases of cholecystitis requiring cholecystectomy would likely free bed days and provide economic benefits to the health care system compared to inpatient-centric practice. Uncertainty in QALY estimates remains a limitation.",

    "abstract": "This study has two primary objectives: (a) to conduct a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of four commonly used oral iron supplements for treating iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy in China, including ferrous succinate sustained-release tablets, polysaccharide-iron complex capsules, iron protein succinylate oral solution, and iron dextran oral solution; and (b) to assess the budget impact of including ferrous succinate sustained-release tablets in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) on national medical insurance expenditures. A decision tree model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness based on treatment efficacy derived from a network meta-analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address uncertainties in the parameters. Subsequently, a budget impact analysis model was utilized to calculate the effect of including ferrous succinate sustained-release tablets in the NRDL on the expenditures of employee medical insurance funds, resident medical insurance funds, and the total medical insurance fund expenditures. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that ferrous succinate sustained-release tablets are a cost-effective treatment option. When compared to polysaccharide-iron complex capsules, the additional cost per effect of the ferrous succinate sustained-release tablets is $3.23. If these tablets are included in the NRDL, the total medical insurance expenditure on oral iron preparations for treating iron-deficiency anemia in pregnant women is expected to decrease from $160.14 million to $156.82 million between 2025 and 2027. Ferrous succinate sustained-release tablets are a cost-effective treatment option for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy in China.",

    "abstract": "Closing the tuberculosis diagnostic gap and scaling up tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) are two global priorities to end tuberculosis. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and societal return on investment of a comprehensive intervention to improve tuberculosis screening and prevention in Brazil, Georgia, Kenya, and South Africa-four distinct epidemiological settings. In this modelling study, in partnership with national tuberculosis programmes we defined a set of interventions (the intervention package) related to tuberculosis screening and TPT in three priority populations: people with HIV, household contacts, and a country-defined high-risk population (people deprived of liberty [Brazil], people accessing care for injection drug use [Georgia], people in informal settlements in nine districts with a high prevalence of tuberculosis [Kenya], and people in the 22 subdistricts with the highest prevalence of tuberculosis [South Africa]). We developed transmission models calibrated to country-specific epidemiology and collated cost data for tuberculosis-related activities and patient costs in 2023 US dollars (US$). We compared the intervention package scaled up to reach all priority populations by 2030 to a status quo scenario based on projected tuberculosis epidemiology over a 27-year time horizon (Jan 1, 2024, to Dec 31, 2050); to delineate the impact of intervention components, we also evaluated the intervention package without TPT. Outcomes were health system and societal costs, number of tuberculosis episodes, tuberculosis deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We calculated the budget impact, health system cost per DALY averted, and societal return on the health system investment for each country. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. With the status quo scenario, by 2050, tuberculosis incidence is projected to be 41 per 100&#x2008;000 population (95% uncertainty range 32-53) in Brazil, 45 per 100&#x2008;000 population (36-60) in Georgia, 214 per 100&#x2008;000 population (146-266) in Kenya, and 261 per 100&#x2008;000 population (133-406) in South Africa. The percentage of all tuberculosis episodes prevented by implementing the intervention package in all priority populations is projected to be 15&#xb7;0% (12&#xb7;8-17&#xb7;5) in Brazil, 14&#xb7;3% (13&#xb7;1-15&#xb7;8) in Georgia, 21&#xb7;3% (15&#xb7;2-27&#xb7;6) in Kenya, and 26&#xb7;4% (21&#xb7;1-31&#xb7;8) in South Africa by 2050. If implemented without TPT (ie, tuberculosis disease screening alone), corresponding reductions were lower at 10&#xb7;4% (8&#xb7;6-12&#xb7;2) in Brazil, 10&#xb7;2% (9&#xb7;5-11&#xb7;2) in Georgia, 12&#xb7;6% (9&#xb7;5-15&#xb7;9) in Kenya, and 16&#xb7;8% (13&#xb7;0-20&#xb7;4) in South Africa. In 2030, the percentage of the national tuberculosis programme budget required for the intervention package was 62% in Brazil, 10% in Georgia, 67% in Kenya, and 44% South Africa. The incremental cost per DALY averted of the intervention package compared with the status quo in all priority populations is $386 in Brazil, $491 in Georgia, $53 in Kenya, and $160 in South Africa. The corresponding societal return per health system dollar invested is projected to be $51 in Brazil, $8 in Georgia, $27 in Kenya, and $54 in South Africa. Scaling up tuberculosis screening and TPT requires substantial investment but is projected to be cost-effective compared with the status quo, to greatly reduce tuberculosis incidence, and to provide large returns on investment.

    "abstract": "Isolation facilities are essential to pandemic response, yet the economic trade-offs of repurposing existing hospitals remain poorly characterised. This study quantifies both the operational costs and the revenue foregone from converting Tigoni Level 4 Hospital (TL4H) into Kiambu County's sole COVID-19 isolation centre. Our study focused on estimating recurrent and labour costs, considering only capital costs incurred during the study period. We conducted a cost analysis at the facility level, assessing all expenditures incurred by TL4H between June 2020 and February 2022, using an activity-based costing approach to allocate costs to specific operational activities. Sensitivity analyses, including one-way and 10,000-draw Monte Carlo PSA, estimated uncertainty in total and per-patient costs. The total operational cost of the isolation centre over the 21 months was KES 489,220,113.98 (USD 4,181,011.14). This translates to an annual operating cost of KES 279,554,350.85 (USD 2,389,149.23). The average cost of managing one COVID-19 patient regardless of severity was estimated as KES 337,626.03 (USD 2885.45). The revenue foregone by waiving user fees for COVID-19 patients was KES 160,678,901.00 (USD 1,374,236). Sensitivity analysis indicated that HRH costs (78.9% of total expenditure) had the largest influence: a &#xb1;20% change shifted total costs by &#xb1;KES 77.6 million (USD 663,191.18). PSA results showed a mean total operational cost of KES 489,212,852 (USD 4,180,949.08; 95% UI: 414,803,680-573,687,849), and a mean cost per patient of KES 337,621.02 (USD 2885.40; 95% UI: 286,268.93-395,919.84). Repurposing TL4H as a COVID-19 isolation centre was resource-intensive, highlighting the importance of strategic budget planning and resource allocation for future preparedness.",

    "abstract": "Implementation costs-the combined costs of delivering expert support and participating in an implementation endeavor-are often omitted from economic evaluations. When included, delivery and participation costs are usually combined, even though these may be covered by different funders. We propose a pragmatic micro-costing approach that separates the delivery and participation costs as well as outlines practical considerations for measuring implementation costs. Sixty-four specialty addiction treatment programs and primary care clinics participated in a stepped sequence of implementation strategies focused on improving access to buprenorphine and naltrexone for persons with opioid use disorder. The implementation strategies deployed were: audit and feedback (A&amp;F), a two-day workshop, internal facilitation, and external facilitation. Our micro-costing approach separately measured the cost to deliver and participate in implementation strategies, as demonstrated through the A&amp;F case example, which was the first of four implementation strategies deployed. We applied the following practical considerations to maximize the precision and accuracy of cost data: 1) Balance the frequency and length of cost survey, 2) Cost tracking training, 3) Regular survey reminders, 4) Tailor cost surveys, 5) Perform frequent cost data validation, 6) Iterative evaluation and refinement. In A&amp;F, the implementation setup cost was $32,266, and the annual recurring costs were $4,231 per clinic. While the majority of the setup cost (99%) can be attributed to A&amp;F delivery, over half of the annual recurring costs (63%) were attributed to clinic participation in A&amp;F. This micro-costing approach appears both pragmatic and meaningful. By understanding the total cost implications of implementation, decision-makers can better select the most suitable strategy based on the context, goals, and budget constraints to efficiently optimize the pace and desired outcome of an implementation endeavor. The trial protocol is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05343793).",

    "abstract": "It is imperative to enhance the scientific management of logistics through the creation and advancement of an Intelligent Logistics Management in Smart Hospitals. This paper presents a preliminary introduction to an intelligent logistics management system. The subsequent section offers a comprehensive overview of the diverse platforms that constitute the intelligent logistics management system. These include the energy management platform, intelligent lighting control platform, one-stop service platform, power operation and maintenance monitoring platform, and the BIM O&amp;M platform, the latter of which is visualised. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive account of the construction, architectural design, and the functions and responsibilities of the constituent sub-platforms. Furthermore, a thorough examination is conducted to ascertain the substantial efficacy and energy-saving impact of implementing an intelligent logistics management system within the context of a hospital project in Shenzhen, China. The findings indicate a substantial reduction in the energy consumption of the entire building structure, with the maximum total energy consumption reduced by 402 MWh, signifying an 18.5% decline. The system has been demonstrated to reduce operational costs and facilitate environmentally conscious operations, which represents a core objective. The construction of the logistics operation and maintenance platform serves to enhance the efficiency of integrated logistics management, as well as the degree of management refinement. The management system, which employs information technology, is an effective tool for the oversight and enhancement of logistics management. Furthermore, the system provides logistical support for the construction of an environmentally sustainable hospital.",

    "abstract": "Rising health care expenditures and dissatisfaction with traditional models of reimbursement have driven an interest in alternative payment model (APM) initiatives. Bundled funding, an APM, was implemented province-wide for elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in Ontario in 2019. In this study, we explored whether procedure volume, quality of care, and cost were affected by the program's introduction. In this retrospective cohort study, we developed pre- and postimplementation patient cohorts with aggregate data collected from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and Canadian Joint Replacement Registry. We assessed quality via length of stay, 30-day readmissions, emergency department visits, and revision surgeries. We assessed costs using methodology and data provided by CIHI. We performed statistical analysis by comparing patient cohorts via &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> and Student <i>t</i> tests. After the introduction of the bundle, case volume increased, length of stay decreased, and more patients were discharged directly home following surgery (<i>p</i> &#x2264; 0.001). Patients with THA were less likely to be readmitted or visit the emergency department in the postbundled cohort (<i>p</i> &#x2264; 0.009). Despite a reduced length of stay, the cost of THA and TKA increased, with $106 more being spent per patient (<i>p</i> &#x2264; 0.001). The introduction of bundled funding for THA and TKA in Ontario was associated with preserved quality of care despite shorter lengths of stay in hospital and reduced use of inpatient rehabilitation. Although cost containment is often a goal of bundled funding, Ontario's model saw a rise in inpatient surgical costs. A shift to outpatient arthroplasty could yield significant cost savings under the current bundle design.

Dans la pr&#xe9;sente &#xe9;tude, nous avons tent&#xe9; de d&#xe9;terminer si l&#x2019;introduction de ce programme avait influ&#xe9; sur le volume des interventions, sur la qualit&#xe9; des soins et sur les co&#xfb;ts. Dans cette &#xe9;tude de cohorte r&#xe9;trospective, nous avons constitu&#xe9; des cohortes de patientes et patients trait&#xe9;s avant et apr&#xe8;s la mise en &#x153;uvre du programme, &#xe0; partir de donn&#xe9;es agr&#xe9;g&#xe9;es recueillies aupr&#xe8;s de l&#x2019;Institut canadien d&#x2019;information sur la sant&#xe9; (ICIS) et du Registre canadien des remplacements articulaires. Nous avons &#xe9;valu&#xe9; la qualit&#xe9; des soins en fonction de la dur&#xe9;e du s&#xe9;jour, des r&#xe9;admissions dans les 30 jours suivants, des visites au service d&#x2019;urgence et des chirurgies de r&#xe9;vision.

Apr&#xe8;s l&#x2019;introduction du financement regroup&#xe9;, le volume des interventions a augment&#xe9;, la dur&#xe9;e des s&#xe9;jours a diminu&#xe9; et un plus grand nombre de personnes ont re&#xe7;u leur cong&#xe9; et sont retourn&#xe9;es directement &#xe0; leur domicile apr&#xe8;s la chirurgie (<i>p</i> &#x2264; 0,001).

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 outbreak in May 2021, our hospital-designated as a specialized facility for severely infected patients-faced critical staff and resource shortages. The urgent need for efficient bed management to ensure timely admissions underscored the inefficiencies of the manual, phone-based allocation process, which averaged 454 seconds per query. Traditional IT solutions were not feasible due to time and cost constraints. This study aims to design and implement a rapid, zero-cost Quick Isolation Bed Inquiry System that provides real-time bed information and enables timely admissions without requiring additional workforce or expense. We conducted a 3-cycle pre-post quality improvement study guided by the Toyota business practice (TBP), an 8-step problem-solving framework. After clarifying the problem and constructing a value stream map, we identified bottlenecks. A user-centered solution was developed by leveraging an underutilized data export function in the hospital's bed inquiry platform. Using Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications, we automated the filtering and display of relevant bed information. The primary outcomes were process time and number of steps; secondary outcomes included staff time savings and system accuracy. The baseline manual process required 25 steps and 454 seconds to complete a query. The new system reduced this to 3 steps and 12 seconds, representing a 97.4% gain in efficiency. Single-click execution generated 3 outputs (administrative PDF, large-screen display, and mobile version) in 4 seconds, with distribution to the hospital LINE group completed in 7 seconds. Reliability reached 100%, with continuous availability through virtual private network access. Development and debugging were completed within 3 days using only existing resources. Postpandemic, the system was adapted for general ward management with minimal modifications. Applying TBP enabled the rapid development of a user-centered, zero-cost bed management tool by repurposing existing digital assets. The intervention markedly improved efficiency, reliability, and usability without additional staffing or expenditure, providing a scalable model for agile health care systems operating under resource constraints. Future work will focus on deeper automation, such as application programming interface-based real-time updates, and on evaluating downstream impacts on patient flow and bed turnover.",

    "abstract": "The development and introduction of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) in surgical departments as part of the \"Supporting Surgery with Geriatric Co-management and AI\" project addresses the challenges of an increasingly aging population. The system enables digital comanagement of older patients by providing evidence-based evaluations of their health status, along with corresponding medical recommendations, with the aim of improving their perioperative care. The use of an AI-based CDSS in patient care raises ethical challenges. Gathering the opinions, expectations, and concerns of older adults (as potential patients) regarding the CDSS enables the identification of ethical opportunities, concerns, and limitations associated with implementing such a system in hospitals. We conducted 5 focus groups with participants aged 65 years or older. The transcripts were evaluated using qualitative content analysis and ethically analyzed. Categories were inductively generated, followed by a thematic classification of participants' statements. We found that technical understanding did not influence the older adults' opinions. Ethical opportunities and concerns were identified. On the one hand, diagnosis and treatment could be accelerated, the patient-AI-physician interaction could enhance medical treatment, and the coordination of hospital processes could be improved. On the other hand, the quality of the CDSS depends on an adequate data foundation and robust cybersecurity. Potential risks included habituation effects, loss of a second medical opinion, and illness severity influencing patients' attitude toward medical recommendations. The risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment was discussed controversially, and treatment options could be influenced by interests and finances. Additional concerns included challenges with time savings, potential declines in medical skills, and effects on the length of hospital stay. To address the ethical challenges, we recommend allocating sufficient time for use of the CDSS and emphasizing individualized review of the CDSS results. Furthermore, we suggest limiting private financial sponsorship.",

According to the Global Burden of Disease, outdoor air pollution was responsible for 4.7 million deaths in 2021. Climate change mitigation policies could provide cobenefits by reducing air pollution. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 report explores scenarios using an updated carbon budget approach-the net-zero pathways-designed to avoid temporary overshoot of the 1.5&#xb0;C temperature limit. We assess whether net-zero pathways consistently improve air pollution outcomes using a global source-receptor air pollution model to estimate concentrations, health impacts, and economic damages. To analyze key uncertainties, we apply multiple relative risk functions and economic damage models. Our findings show that stringent climate policies, avoiding overshoot and keeping below 2&#xb0;C, offer substantial health and economic cobenefits, particularly for China and India, and avoid 207,000 premature deaths and 2269 billion USD2020 in damages by 2030.",

Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable due to its susceptibility to frequent climate shocks and socioeconomic challenges. This study investigates the causal relationship between remittance receipt and food security through a comprehensive analysis. Using data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2022, we developed a food security index incorporating calorie intake, dietary diversity, food expenditure, and the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) score. Advanced statistical methods, including Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial, linear regression model, inverse-probability-weighting (IPW), and doubly robust method were employed to identify the factors associated with food security and assess the causal effect of remittance earning. Our findings reveal a strong and positive causal effect of remittance receipt on food security. The observed causal effect remained robust against model misspecification and unmeasured confounders, as confirmed through sensitivity analysis. Key factors such as wealth index, residence type, regional differences, household head's education, and number of earners also influenced food security outcomes. However, the significance of variables like land ownership, household head's age, and sex varied across measures. This study highlights the transformative role of remittances in reducing food insecurity. Policies that support remittance flows, improve rural infrastructure, and promote skill development and financial literacy can further strengthen their impact.",

The test also reports an illness severity score, an all-cause predictor of the need for critical care (mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy or renal replacement therapy) within 7&#x2009;days of testing.<b>Hypothesis/Gap Statement.</b> Differentiating the source and assessing disease severity in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with signs and symptoms of sepsis remains an unmet medical need.<b>Aim.</b> The results of the TriVerity test were compared to the EPIC sepsis score, systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, discharge diagnoses, location of patient discharge and an assessment of potential cost savings in unnecessary resource utilization.<b>Methodology.</b> Blood was retained from 30&#x2009;patients presenting to the ED with signs and symptoms suggestive of sepsis. Remnant EDTA-preserved blood from routine medical testing was transferred into PAXgene tubes, stored frozen and retrospectively tested with TriVerity.<b>Results.</b> TriVerity was correctly correlated with clinical diagnosis and outcomes in 29 of 30&#x2009;patients with one false negative (low severity score for sepsis diagnosis, admitted for bladder cancer and on pre-existing antibiotic therapy). For two&#x2009;patients with a positive TriVerity bacterial and severity score, antibiotic treatment may have been initiated 6-9&#x2009;h earlier if tested prospectively. Twelve patients were discharged home with a mean ED length of stay of 7.25&#x2009;h, of which 7 (58&#x200a;%) had a positive EPIC sepsis score (&gt;5) and all had a low TriVerity severity score. If this test were performed prospectively at ED presentation, a net savings of $351 per patient is estimated in direct laboratory, radiology and ED costs alone, without consideration of potentially shorter hospital stays or changed disposition.<b>Conclusion.</b> The TriVerity test may enable early consideration of ruling in or out of bacterial and/or viral infection, provide severity assessment of adult patients presenting to the ED suspected of, and help reduce unnecessary utilization of laboratory and ED resources.",

Manual typing, although reliable, is time-consuming and can negatively impact clinical efficiency. This Service Improvement Pilot study evaluates the impact of Heidi Health's Ambient Voice Technology on documentation efficiency, clinician workload, and patient satisfaction during clinical consultations. An observational analysis was conducted on 100 case notes in an SDEC setting. Documentation times using Heidi Health's Ambient Voice Technology were recorded, while manual documentation times were estimated based on word counts and typical typing speeds. Clinician feedback was gathered on usability and administrative burden, and patient feedback focused on the consultation experience. Ambient Voice Technology reduced documentation time by 85.8%, saving an average of 5.27 minutes (equivalent to 5 minutes 16 seconds) per case compared to manual typing (p &lt; 0.001). Clinicians reported high usability scores (mean = 9.1/10), reduced administrative burden, and improved consultation flow. Additionally, 90% of patients reported an enhanced consultation experience. Ambient Voice Technology significantly improves documentation efficiency, reduces clinician workload, and enhances patient satisfaction in SDEC settings.

    "abstract": "Between 1 November and 12 December 2019, a Legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak occurred in the Strasbourg metropolitan area, France. Epidemiological, environmental and genomic investigations (nested sequence-based typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS)) were undertaken to locate the outbreak source, characterise the causal <i>Legionella</i> strain, and understand its spread. Through a positive urinary antigen test, 28 cases (14 male; 14 female) with 70&#x2009;years median age (range:&#x2009;42-88&#x2009;years) were diagnosed. Two died. For nine cases, typing revealed <i>L. pneumophila</i> serogroup 1 (Lp&#x2009;1) sequence type (ST)&#x2009;62 infection. Mapping where cases were during their incubation period pointed to a place south-west of Strasbourg city as the outbreak epicentre. There, in the biomass condensing boiler of a heating plant, high Lp&#x2009;1 contamination levels (105-106&#x2009;CFU/L) were discovered. Eight environmental Lp&#x2009;1 isolates from inside the plant were ST62. Analysing WGS data from these isolates and the nine Lp&#x2009;1 ST62 clinical isolates, found their sequences clustering with zero to two single nt polymorphisms. Sub-optimal maintenance and warm weather before the boiler started operating may have allowed Lp&#x2009;1 proliferation within, with boiler fumes subsequently disseminating Lp&#x2009;1, thereby exposing people. This outbreak highlights potential LD risks arising from innovative energy-saving heat production processes designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "In today's generation, where purchasing is one click away, young Filipino adults seem to set aside the value of proper handling of money in order to possess products that catch their attention. Most of them buy luxuries rather than saving for the future and live in the \"you only live once\" philosophy. On the other hand, one way to develop wise spending behavior among young adults is to make them financially literate. Unfortunately, being financially literate is slightly seen among Filipino youths today. The main objective of this research was to examine the relationship between financial literacy and impulse buying behavior among college students at Bulacan State University. The study was anchored in Prospect Theory based on an individual's perceived gains and utility. Spearman correlation was employed to determine and analyze the results of 280 college students at Bulacan State University. The results revealed that the financial literacy of college students has a positive and significant relationship with impulse buying behavior. This implies that as their financial literacy increases, their impulse buying behavior increases. In conclusion, Bulacan State University college students value present choices and benefits more than the future.",

Responses to items about key aspects of financial literacy—i.e., budgeting, debt, saving, investment, and insurance—were elicited from a large sample of Saudi citizens through an online survey. The data from 887 completed surveys were subjected to a descriptive analysis, a T-test, and ANOVA. A high level of financial literacy was found among the respondents in relation to budgeting, debt, and saving, but only a moderate level in relation to investment and insurance. The study findings indicate that current efforts on the part of government agencies, schools, universities, and financial institutions focused on budgeting, debt, and saving should continue and that more attention should be paid to educating Saudi citizens in relation to investment and insurance.",

    "abstract": "General Background: The rapid growth of digital technology has transformed financial systems worldwide, with students increasingly reliant on digital payment platforms such as e-wallets. Specific Background: While these innovations offer convenience, they may also encourage impulsive spending, raising concerns about students’ saving behavior. Knowledge Gap: Previous studies have shown inconsistent findings regarding the role of financial literacy, lifestyle, and digital payment use in shaping saving habits, highlighting the need for further investigation. Aims: This study examines the influence of financial literacy, lifestyle, and e-wallet usage on students’ saving behavior at Universitas Pembangunan Nasional “Veteran” Jawa Timur. Results: Using survey data from 300 respondents and SmartPLS analysis, the findings reveal that financial literacy, lifestyle, and e-wallet usage each have a positive and significant effect on saving behavior, with financial literacy contributing the strongest influence. Collectively, these variables explain 45.8% of the variation in saving behavior. Novelty: This study uniquely demonstrates that when managed wisely, lifestyle choices and digital financial tools, often seen as consumption drivers, can in fact reinforce positive financial habits. Implications: The findings underscore the importance of strengthening financial literacy education and promoting mindful technology use as strategic approaches to foster sustainable financial resilience among students.\nHighlights:\n\n\nFinancial literacy has the strongest influence on saving behavior.\n\n\nLifestyle management supports positive saving habits.\n\n\nE-wallets can aid saving when used wisely.\n\n\nKeywords: Financial Literacy, Lifestyle, E-Wallet, Saving Behavior, Students",

    "abstract": "Surgery is essential to help people regain health and get back to work. Many Africans cannot afford traditional surgery because the sedation and main operating room sterility components are much too expensive. This often results in crushing debt for African families. Lack of access to surgery leads to poverty and poverty leads to lack of access to surgery. Wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet surgery, minimal pain tumescent local anesthesia, and evidence-based sterility are 3 disruptive game-changing innovations that eliminate the expensive general anesthesia and/or main operating room sterility components for many operations. Eliminating the tourniquet removes its need for sedation. Minimal pain tumescent local anesthesia enables comfortable numbing of large areas of the body to perform sedation-free operations such as soft tissue facial reconstruction, long bone fracture fixation, breast surgery, hernia repair, extremity surgery, and skin grafting. Evidence-based sterility has proven that many operations can be performed with field sterility outside of the main operating room environment with no significant increase in infection rates. No sedation also means no need for the main operating room environment. Moving some surgery out of the main operating room increases access for other operations that need full sterility to be accomplished. Since January 2020, these 3 disruptive changes have been adopted in 75 hospitals in 8 East African countries. This article documents how these changes have decreased the costs of surgery for the patients and, therefore, increased access to surgery, which helps alleviate poverty.",

    "abstract": "The increasing trend in household consumption debt in Indonesia, especially through digital lending platforms, has become a societal concern. From an Islamic perspective, debt is governed by ethical principles that emphasize fulfilling obligations responsibly and prudently. Achieving this requires self-discipline, supported by informed financial attitudes and knowledge. This study analyzes the effects of attitudes toward money and financial literacy, specifically debt and Islamic financial literacy, on the financial management behavior of young Muslim adults in Indonesia. It also examines differences in these effects between individuals with debt and those without. Data from 245 respondents were collected using structured questionnaires, analyzed through multiple linear regression, and further tested using the Chow Test to compare the two groups. Results indicate that attitudes toward money, debt, and Islamic financial literacy positively affect financial management behavior. However, in partial analysis, only Islamic financial literacy does not significantly impact financial management behavior. Additionally, comparisons between the two groups revealed no significant differences in financial management behavior between those with debt and those without, likely due to similar financial management tendencies across both groups.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of impulsive buying becomes common today, along with the rampant variety of marketing promotions carried out by business people. Many consumers make purchases impulsively after being attracted to several factors that drive this behavior. The purchases due to unplanned decisions often occur in products and services of taḥsīnīyāt. Actually there is nothing wrong with the behavior of impulsive buying, if the consumers who do it have fulfilled the ḍarūrīyāt needs and have prepared their future needs. However, it becomes a problem if impulsive buying for products and services of taḥsīnīyāt precede the primary needs that have not been fulfilled properly. This research will try to provide a brief solution on how to limit the self from rughbah and shahwat of buying, by planning income for several financial posts. Here the author offers the concept of Islamic models of saving and investment which can also be interpreted as Islamic family wealth management. It is hoped that this research can provide a meaningful contribution to human developmen",

    "abstract": "The lack of public awareness about saving is still happening. So far, people's Saving Behavior is only done when there is a surplus of income after consumption is fulfilled. The fundamental problem faced by humans from birth is the human need to meet their daily needs. Human nature who is always dissatisfied with what they have achieved makes them have to try. There are many ways to do it, including setting aside or saving some of the results of consumption and preparing for the future. Therefore, it is necessary to instill the habit of saving from an early age in children so that their inexhaustible needs in the future can be minimized.\r\n               This research was conducted on 410 students in Batam related to student’s savings habits. The results of the questionnaires were then processed using SPSS. The test results indicated that there is a significant positive relationship in all tested variables in accordance with the formulated hypothesis. The results of this study are expected to enrich research related to the interest in saving among students as the nation's next generation.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to prove the effect of financial literacy, individual characteristics, financial risk tolerance on the retirement budget of the State Civil Apparatus in the Provincial Government of West Sumatra. In addition, this study aims to prove financial risk tolerance as a moderator of the relationship between financial literacy and retirement budget and moderation of the relationship between individual characteristics and retirement budget in the State Civil Apparatus in the Provincial Government of West Sumatra. Data collection was carried out by distributing questionnaires directly or using a Google form. Based on the results of hypothesis testing, it was found that financial literacy, individual characteristics, and financial risk tolerance had a positive and significant effect on the retirement budget, while individual characteristics as measured by gender and number of dependents did not have a significant effect on the retirement budget. Financial risk tolerance weakens the relationship between financial literacy and retirement budget. financial risk tolerance does not moderate the relationship between individual characteristics and the retirement budget of the State Civil Apparatus.",

However, a consolidated theoretical explanation of such connections is missing. We contribute to this topic by building a framework that includes all these decisions in an encompassing model. We build a two-period model in which individuals acquire education, work, and save for retirement; financial literacy reduces the costs of managing risky assets available on the stock market. Our results, besides providing a theoretical foundation for the role and the determinants of the above-mentioned decisions, can also explain several stylized facts on literacy, human capital, and stock market participation.",

The data for this research were collected in two phases from a sample of 266 students in Jakarta. The collected data were then analyzed using macro process version 4 to assess the proposed hypotheses. The study's findings confirm that subjective financial well-being and Islamic financial literacy negatively impact compulsive buying behavior. Moreover, the study reveals a subsequent influence of compulsive buying on future financial well-being, supporting a reciprocal relationship. Additionally, Islamic financial literacy plays a crucial role in mitigating the effect of financial well-being on compulsive buying behavior.&#x0D;\nPublic interest statements &#x0D;\nTechnological developments have brought changes in consumer behavior and sometimes have a negative impact on compulsive buying behavior. This research helps mitigate the effects of subjective financial well-being on compulsive behavior and how the two influence each other.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the behavior of investment decisions that were not only assumed on rationality but were also affected by other factors, such as psychological factors, one of which was financial literacy. There were so many causal studies of financial literacy and investment intentions. However, there were still issues of inclusion between studies. Therefore, this study adopted a theory of planned behavior, proposed as an explanatory model for investment intentions associated with financial literacy. By proposing attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control related to investment as a mediator of investment intention, the unit of analysis was students who were members of the capital market study group spreading across universities in Semarang. The sample used was 170 students conducted through a questionnaire survey, then analyzed descriptive statistics and SEM with the PLST Warp. The results showed that all variables, both attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of behavioral control, significantly mediated the effect of financial literacy on investment intention in partial mediation. For future research, you can explore the variables of financial education as early predictors associated with this research model to get a holistic picture related to the effectiveness of student financial education.",

Unlike prior studies, this article examines the relative strength of the association of financial literacy, attitude toward balancing spending and savings, and financial satisfaction with credit card debt- taking behavior by analyzing the 2016 wave of the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. We find that higher financial literacy is associated with less credit card debt. However, incorporating the other factors reduces this relationship. Our results advise policy-makers to include components in the financial literacy curricula that encourage savings attitude to reduce problematic debt-taking.",

P2P Lending has become one of the most popular fintech services, offering accessible and affordable loans to various segments of society. However, the ease of access has led to challenges, with many individuals, including teachers, facing the risks of over-indebtedness. This study investigates the role of debt literacy, financial management practices, and financial confidence in influencing over-indebtedness among teachers in Karawang Regency. Using a quantitative approach, data from 385 teachers were analyzed through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the complex relationships between variables, considering the influence of demographic factors. The findings reveal that debt literacy and financial management practices have no significant negative impact on over-indebtedness, while financial confidence has no significant positive impact.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the relationship between financial/numeric literacy and household saving and investment behaviors using the New York Feds Survey of Consumer Expectations. Using a panel dataset and a regression analysis, the study finds that although overall propensities to save, measured by saving rate and savings-to-wealth ratio, does not show a significant correlation with literacy measures, individuals portfolio choices between risk-free and risky assets are indeed affected by both literacy measures. The research indicates that individuals who report higher self-rated financial literacy and attain higher numeracy scores tend to allocate a more substantial portion of their savings into stocks. By contrast, they are inclined to hold a smaller portion of their wealth in risk-free liquid assets, such as checking accounts. More particularly, individuals with higher numeracy scores tend to allocate approximately 5.384% greater portion of their investments into stocks while simultaneously reducing their investments in checking accounts by 4.251%. Similarly, those with higher financial literacy tend to demonstrate an average increase of 10.085% in stock investments, coupled with a decrease of 12.506% in checking account investments. Notably, these effects are separate from influences of other factors like education, gender, and income.",

This study was conducted with Chinese beauty brands targeting customers via TikTok Shop to promote their brands internationally. Data were collected through online surveys conducted after each experimental live-streaming session. Data analysis was conducted using CB-SEM.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  The results indicate that task-oriented streamer communication on traditional e-commerce platforms significantly influences consumer impulse buying behavior, directly and indirectly, via mediated interaction when beauty brands do international marketing via social media e-commerce platforms. Meanwhile, social-oriented streamer communication significantly affects impulse buying behavior on such platforms. Consumer language literacy moderates the relationship between streamer communication style, e-commerce platform type and mediated interaction.\n               \n               \n                  Practical implications\n                  This study provides valuable insights for marketing managers aiming for international marketing to leverage live streaming marketing activities. It offers live streamers and e-retailers guidance on enhancing customer impulsive buying behavior.\n               \n               \n                  Originality/value\n                  Although prior research has looked at streamer communication styles and customer engagement in impulsive buying behavior, the influence of consumers’ language literacy, particularly in a second language, as a moderating factor and the role of mediating interaction as a mediator in the context of international marketing of the beauty sector is still unexplored. This study explicitly fills the gap in the global marketing environment of the beauty sector by examining the vital role of consumers’ language literacy and mediated interaction in impulsive buying behavior. It enriches the expanding body of studies on live-streaming e-commerce. From the methodological perspective, this study employed a novel experimental design to address the gap by examining how consumer language literacy moderates between streamer communication styles and impulse buying behavior while mediated interaction boosts the relationship as a mediator.",

    "abstract": "General Background: The rapid expansion of Islamic financial institutions necessitates deeper understanding of how youth perceive and engage with them. Specific Background: High school students, as future economic agents, form an important demographic whose saving behavior can reflect the success of Islamic banking outreach. Knowledge Gap: Despite growing access to Islamic banking, limited studies address the combined influence of perception and financial literacy on students' saving decisions. Aims: This study aims to analyze how perceptions of Islamic banking and financial literacy affect saving decisions among students of Jabal Noor IT High School in relation to Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI). Results: Using a quantitative method and survey data from 79 students, regression analysis revealed that both perception of Islamic banking (t=4.621) and financial literacy (t=7.530) have a positive and statistically significant effect (p=0.000) on students’ saving decisions. Novelty: The study uniquely focuses on the dual impact of cognitive and attitudinal variables in a high school Islamic context, offering early insights into youth engagement with Sharia-compliant finance. Implications: Findings highlight the importance of fostering positive perceptions and improving financial literacy to enhance saving behavior among young consumers in Islamic banking environments.\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights the significant role of Islamic banking perception in influencing youth saving behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmphasizes financial literacy as a key driver of informed financial decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides early insights into student engagement with Sharia-compliant banking.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Islamic Banking, Financial Literacy, Saving Decisions, Student Perceptions, Bank Syariah Indonesia",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of e-commerce and social media integration has significantly transformed consumer purchasing behavior, especially among digital-native generations. Generation Z, known for their strong online presence and responsiveness to trends, is particularly vulnerable to impulsive buying triggered by online marketing strategies. This study aims to examine the influence of flash sales, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), and digital financial literacy on impulsive buying behavior among Generation Z users of TikTok Shop X Tokopedia in Samarinda, Indonesia. The research involved 106 respondents selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed through multiple linear regression using SPSS software. The results show that FOMO has a significant and positive effect on impulsive buying, whereas flash sales and digital financial literacy do not have significant individual effects. However, when combined, all three variables significantly influence impulsive buying, accounting for 42.2% of the behavior variance. These findings highlight the psychological and emotional factors—particularly FOMO—as more dominant drivers than promotional or financial literacy factors. The study suggests that understanding these behavioral dynamics is essential for businesses targeting young online consumers, while also underscoring the need for improved digital financial awareness among youth.",

    "abstract": "The sudden urge to buy, referred to as impulsive buying, is triggered by both a gamut of extraneous, market-related stimuli and internal psychological factors. The extant literature on this has majorly focused on the antecedents of impulsive shopping, prominent among these include traits (like sensation-seeking and impulse buying tendency or IBT), motives (utilitarian, hedonic), shoppers’ resources (time and money), and marketing stimuli. Although personality is a key determinant of consumer decision-making, the role of personality traits, specially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, in impulse buying is not conclusive. Also, there exists a need for analysing impulse buying behaviour with respect to product-specific situations rather than general IBT. The present study fills this gap by analysing the role of three personality traits on impulse buying. A scenario-based online experiment was conducted, and the sample respondents were randomly categorised into two groups. The former group had respondents with an instrument to measure their IBT in general, while the later had respondents for whom the instrument was shared with a scenario built around the product category of apparel. With the data set of 386 respondents, the study reveals that the relationships between the two personality traits—extraversion and neuroticism, and IBT—are independent of the product category. However, the influence of conscientiousness on impulsive buying tendency depends on the product category. The study concludes with managerial implications.",

    "abstract": "Comprehending the link between impulse buying and retailer loyalty programs is crucial in retail marketing. These programs, designed to encourage repeat purchases and foster customer loyalty with personalized rewards, profoundly impact impulsive behaviors. This study uses a mixed methods approach to assess the effectiveness of loyalty strategies across diverse consumer demographics. Rewards such as discounts, points, or exclusive access cultivate a sense of belonging and exclusivity, influencing purchasing decisions by triggering immediate incentives and urgency through limited time offers. Emotional and psychological factors drive impulse buying. The expectation of rewards, the excitement of earning points, and the sense of exclusivity all play roles in impulsive purchases. Retailers can capitalize on these motivators by tailoring programs accordingly. Demographic variables such as age, income, and shopping habits influence program effectiveness, with younger consumers typically favoring digital rewards and older consumers showing a preference for traditional discounts. Qualitative research delves into motivations and perceptions, providing rich insights into how loyalty programs influence impulse buying behaviors. This holistic approach offers valuable insights for refining marketing strategies, increasing customer loyalty, and promoting impulse buying through personalized rewards, real-time offers, and gamification.",

    "abstract": "Financial literacy has an important role in the sustainability of an ideal and quality life. Human ability to manage finances affects the welfare of their lives. Knowing financial management patterns is fundamental for each individual elementary school-level child in maintaining balanced financial management. Not all upper-grade students at the elementary school education level are aware of the importance of understanding financial management and saving from an early age. The existence of financial literacy in elementary schools in grade VI classes provides a benchmark for sustainable savings awareness. This study was conducted to determine financial literacy skills as a basis for understanding saving awareness in elementary school students. The sample used in this study was 30 grade VI students at SDN Trimulyo Yogyakarta. This research used a mixed method by collecting data through questionnaires given to students as well as direct interview observations with students and teachers. The results of this study indicate that financial literacy in grade VI students at Trimulyo Elementary School in Yogyakarta has a positive impact on early saving awareness. Based on this, the findings in the field prove that the urgency of saving money in elementary school students has a big impact on simple financial management wisely on an ongoing basis. Thus, elementary school students have good financial literacy skills, as evidenced by the ability to manage money and save it.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination is a delay in an intended course of action and, thus, a self-regulation failure hindering growth and well-being. Contrarily, self-regulation is a set of cognitive and metacognitive skills and strategies supporting goal-directed behavior. There is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which (and the ways in which) promoting self-regulation may counteract procrastination. On the one hand, it is argued that procrastination is linked with stable personal dispositions; on the other hand, it is said that this problematic behavior is associated with contextual influences. To deepen the understanding of these relationships, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a theory-driven model integrating four self-regulation factors (goal setting, decision making, persevering, and learning from mistakes) and two measures of procrastination (irrational and academic). We hypothesized that goal setting, decision making, and perseverance would sequentially mediate between learning from mistakes and procrastination outcomes, thus, suggesting that cognitive-motivational (learning from mistakes, goal setting), strategic (decision making), and volitional (perseverance) factors may all be necessary for successful self-regulation, which could potentially be promoted by contextual influences. Participants of the present study were 433 Chilean university students (304 women, 129 men, M = 20.74 years, SD = 2.86) who completed measures for procrastination and self-regulation. Findings support the important roles of goal setting and perseverance for successful self-regulation and suggest that goal setting may mediate the effects of learning from mistakes on perseverance and decision making; whereas perseverance may mediate the effects of goal setting and decision making on procrastination variations. These results suggest that the negative effects of motivational and strategic factors of self-regulation on procrastination may depend at least partly on the abilities to improve goals and persevere. Taking into account these critical roles in dealing with procrastination, it seems appropriate to support college students' self-regulation skills and strategies, raising awareness about the indispensability of adequate goal setting and persistence in following through with intended courses of action.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination is a well-known phenomenon experienced by a lot of people in everyday life. People sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally put off their tasks even though they might be worse off due to the delay (e.g., not paying bills due, even though they have sufficient funds in their bank account). It is safe to say everybody procrastinates at some point, but in academia the rate is relatively higher. This dissertation is an exploratory study of the relationship and differences between self-reported academic procrastination and observed procrastination in relation to students' achievement goal orientations and self-regulated learning. A time-management/productivity mobile application (Proccoli) was developed and used to examine how students plan their studies toward their academic goals and whether they stick to their original plans (e.g., planned vs actual time they started working on a goal), change of study pattern and frequency when getting close to deadlines, and self-monitoring patterns across different academic procrastination levels. The main purpose of this dissertation is to bring a new perspective to academic procrastination studies particularly measuring and detecting procrastination utilizing mobile technology. The results revealed that students' perceptions and self-reports about their own procrastinatory behaviors do not match well with their actual studying behavior toward accomplishing their academic goals. Procrastinators are underestimating their actual procrastination behavior. Furthermore, higher level procrastinators are more likely to check their progress toward accomplishing their academic goals. The results, also, revealed meaningful relationships between how students carried out their initial plan on an academic goal and their achievement goal orientations.

    "abstract": "Introduction: A common impediment to any student's academic achievement and well being is the phenomenon of procrastination. Procrastination has typically been defined as a trait or behavioural disposition to postpone or delay performing a task or making decision. It is voluntary yet irrational delay of an intended course of action and frequently results in unsatisfactory, performance and emotional upset. Whereas, active procrastination is one's intentional decision to procrastinate in order to cope and focus attention on other tasks at hand and to experience performance pressure. Method: This study attempted to explore pre-University college (PUC) students' active procrastination in relation to their self-regulated learning. 120 PUC students were selected from four different schools of Gulbarga town in Karnataka state of India through multistage random sampling. With the demographic details of students, they were administered Active procrastination scale and Self-regulated learning measure. Results: Students of educated parents and boys have higher active procrastination. Urban and rural students do not differ in their active procrastination. Goal setting and planning, seeking information, keeping records and rehearsing and memorizing strategies are significantly related to active procrastination. Discussion and Conclusion: Urban students have higher organizing and transforming, rehearsing and memorizing and seeking social assistance SRL strategies. Students who engage in more than one hobby have better goal setting and planning, information seeking and total SRL. Active procrastination has significant relation with goal setting and planning, seeking information, keeping records, rehearsing and memorizing SRL strategies.",

    "abstract": "Effective time management, encompassing prioritization, overcoming procrastination, and balancing socialization, is crucial for academic success as it enables students to optimize their productivity, focus on important tasks, and maintain a healthy work-life balance, leading to improved academic achievements. Thus, the present study tried to investigate the relationship between time management in terms of prioritization, procrastination, and socialization and academic achievement. Using validated, reliable and standardized questionnaire, the researchers surveyed 213 education students using simple random technique. The study utilized quantitative approach, non-experimental, descriptive-correlational techniques. The study used mean, standard deviation and correlational analysis to analyzed the data. Based on the findings, the overall level of time management is moderate. The level of academic achievement is very good. In the test of correlation, the finding revealed that time management shows insignificant association with academic achievement. Thus, the finding suggests that the effectiveness of time management techniques in terms of the ability to prioritize tasks, the tendency to procrastinate, and the level of socialization may not be strong predictors of academic success in this specific setting or population under in this present investigation.",

College students (N = 446) completed a self-report survey that assessed motivational and strategic aspects of self-regulated learning, time management, and procrastination. Results of regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy and metacognitive strategies initially were significant predictors of traditional and active forms of procrastination. Incorporating time management in the analyses increased the amount of the variance explained and, even in the presence of the motivation and strategy variables, time management emerged as an important predictor of both traditional and active forms of procrastination. Findings support the conclusion that academic time management is a key aspect of self-regulated learning and, as such, it can be useful for understanding the extent to which college students procrastinate when doing their academic work.",

Approach dimensions of both the mastery and performance goal orientations were found to be positively correlated with procrastination, but the avoidance dimensions of the mastery and performance goal orientations were not associated with procrastination. In regression analyses, mastery approach was the strongest predictor of procrastination, suppressing the effect of performance approach. The results suggest that the Western values underlying the achievement goals portrayed by the goal achievement model may not accurately reflect the motivations that are intrinsic to non-Western individuals.

Additionally, the classroom environment and self-regulatory traits may have joint effects on academic procrastination, but this question has not been adequately researched. Addressing these gaps, the present study examines how classroom goal structures and students' grit predict procrastination in mathematics learning, utilizing a sample of 915 primary school students in China. The findings reveal that grit mediates the relationship between classroom goal structures and procrastination. Specifically, classroom mastery goal structure was positively related to grit and further negatively predicted procrastination tendencies. The results also highlight the maladaptive role of performance goal structure, as it was negatively linked with students' consistency of interest and predicted a higher risk of mathematics procrastination. The results extend our understanding of the underlying relationships between classroom climate, self-regulatory traits, and procrastination. The potential reasons for and implications of the findings are discussed.",

Results of &quot;t&quot;-test showed significant differences between male and female students in terms of academic procrastination, organizing, and fear of failure. Male students compared to females scored higher in academic procrastination. Females students compared to males scored higher in fear of failure and organizing. Findings of Pearson correlations showed a positive association between fear of failure and academic procrastination, and a negative association between subscales of self-regulation and academic procrastination. Also, linear regression analyses showed that fear of failure and responsibility predict academic procrastination.

    "abstract": "Study goals and effective management of study time are both linked to academic success for undergraduates. Mastery goals in particular are associated with study enjoyment and positive educational outcomes such as conceptual change. Conversely, poor self-regulation, in the form of procrastination, is linked to a range of negative study behaviours. Many researchers have treated goal orientations and procrastination tendency as stable traits and few have examined differences across academic levels. This study reports a cross-sectional measure of study goal orientation and procrastination tendency profiles at different academic levels on two undergraduate programmes. Findings concur with other studies in revealing a significant decline in mastery goals, particularly between the first and second years of study. Procrastination tendency is significantly higher in the second year. Potential causes of these differences and their implications are discussed, alongside considerations for positive learning environments.",

Twenty-six participants completed a computer-based data entry task. Performance was measured during an initial baseline, a goal setting intervention that consisted of either a high, unattainable goal (high goal condition) or a low, attainable goal (low goal condition), followed by a return to baseline, and a second goal setting intervention (the alternate goal to the first goal). In the fifth condition, each participant was given the choice to work in either the high or low goal condition. Greater performance increases were reliably observed during the high goal condition than during the low goal condition, but patterns of persistence or deterioration varied across participants. The implications of the findings for the development and understanding of goal setting interventions in the workplace are explored. (Contains 5 tables and 6 figures.)",

However, little research was found that directly compares academic procrastination across different academic grade levels. The present study used a self-regulated learning perspective to compare procrastination types and associated motivation between undergraduate and graduate students. Sixty-six undergraduate and sixty-eight graduate students responded to a packet of questionnaires concerning their experience in an educational psychology class. The results show that students' beliefs about the usefulness of procrastination were a better predictor of academic procrastination than self-efficacy beliefs and achievement goal orientations. Student age was related to procrastination types. Among the undergraduate procrastinators, the younger students were more likely to engage in active procrastination while the older students tended to engage in passive procrastination. Implications and future research directions are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

    "abstract": "Academic procrastination is seen to be quite common among undergraduates and time management is thought to be one of the possible reasons of it. Two surveys, academic procrastination and time management, were given to 332 undergraduate students in this correlational research. Students' academic procrastination is explained through frequencies and percentages and a correlation is questioned between academic procrastination and time management. Regression analysis is used to find out if time management predicts academic procrastination in a statistically significant way. Besides, students' level of time management (low, medium, high) is examined and covariance analysis has been carried out to see if time management level and gender, time management level and housing type (private or state dormitory or house), time management level and their major and time management level and where they live have a common effect on academic procrastination. Results indicate that students are generally indecisive about their behaviors of procrastination in academic tasks and are in middle level in terms of time management skills. There is a moderate level, negative sided and statistically significant correlation between academic procrastination and time management. Not a common effect of mentioned above variables is seen.",

    "abstract": "Students spend little time completing tasks when deadlines are far off; however, they tend to increase their work amounts as deadline approaches. This phenomenon, which is called deadline rush, can be modeled by exponential distributions. Deadline reactivity, represented by a rate parameter of the exponential distribution, parameterizes individual differences in procrastination. That is, an individual with high reactivity to deadlines procrastinates more than an individual with low deadline reactivity. While the phenomenon and parametric models of individual differences in procrastination have been investigated, practical applications in the classroom setting have garnered little attention from researchers. Past research on procrastination has not much considered its relationships with learning environment factors and academic performance, with a lack of objective measurements and heavy reliance on self-reported questionnaires. My dissertation will respond to this gap in the research by modeling students' individual procrastination in university classroom settings, paying close attention to factors influencing the students' procrastination as well as the effects of procrastination on performance. In particular, the dissertation will answer the following three research questions: (1) Do learning environments (i.e., online learning, task complexity, and time in the academic term) affect students' procrastination? (2) Does procrastination affect individual and team performance? and (3) How can procrastination be predicted through physiological responses (i.e., eye movement, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature)? The first two research questions have been answered by longitudinal field studies, while controlled laboratory experiments are conducted to answer the third research question. My findings shed light on how objective modeling and prediction of procrastination can be applied in the classroom setting. In particular, the findings will provide instructors, researchers, and online learning platforms with practical strategies to better design classes and interventions of procrastination for improvements in students' performance.

In the context of a college success course, we gathered insights from assignments to consider various facets of students' time-related behaviors and attitudes. Specifically, we examined a range of indicators of time management (i.e., setting goals and priorities, mechanics of time management, preference for organization, and procrastination) and use (i.e., total hours tracked in various categories, patterns of time use during a seven-day period). Implications for practice derive from the tendencies for the group of enrolled students as a whole as well as the differences between students who were and were not on academic probation.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: The hypothesis that study strategies can compensate for less study time in predicting learning outcomes has often been proposed but rarely tested empirically. Methods: In the present study, 231 university students reported their daily perceived time spent on self-study, study strategies (planning, monitoring, concentration and procrastination) and goal achievement over a 30 days period. Results and Conclusion: Results showed that both more overall perceived study time and better study strategies (better planning, monitoring, and concentration, less procrastination) predicted higher goal achievement at the end of the day. In addition, perceived study time and study strategies interactively predicted goal achievement. When students reported better planning, monitoring and concentration as well as lower procrastination, less time was needed to achieve a high goal level compared to days on which they studied less strategically. In other words, when students studied less strategically, they had to invest more time to reach a higher goal level. In addition, perceived study time and study strategies were related to students' negative affect. Negative affect was particularly high when students studied for many hours with low concentration, and it was particularly low when students studied for only a few hours and procrastinated less. Taken together, the results suggest a compensatory effect of study time and study strategies on daily goal achievement and affect, highlighting the need to teach students effective study strategies.",

There are prevailing questions regarding the underlying and maintaining mechanisms of procrastination which are yet to be learnt. The aim of the present study was to combine different ways to explain procrastination and explore how students' time and effort management skills, psychological flexibility and academic self-efficacy are connected to procrastination as they have been commonly addressed separately in previous studies. The data were collected from 135 students who participated in a voluntary time management and well-being course in autumn 2019. The results showed that students' ability to organize their time and effort has the strongest association with procrastination out of the variables included in the study. Psychological flexibility also has a strong individual role in explaining procrastination along with time and effort management skills. Surprisingly, academic self-efficacy did not have a direct association with procrastination. Interestingly, our findings further suggest that time and effort management and psychological flexibility are closely related and appear to go hand in hand and, thus, both need to be considered when the aim is to reduce procrastination. The implications of the findings are further discussed.",

We randomly assigned 96 students to a treatment (n?=?47) and a control group (n?=?49). As hypothesised, participants of the control group showed procrastination: they spent more time on a self-selected, important academic task right before the deadline was reached compared to the weeks before. The participants of the treatment group, instead, allocated their work time more equally and did not show procrastination.

Findings of regression analyses indicated that parental expectations and criticism were the key predictors of students' adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism. Students' perceptions of classroom structure also positively predicted their adaptive perfectionism. Moreover, results of hierarchical regressions suggested that perceived classroom structure, parental expectations and criticism, as well as adaptive perfectionism all emerged as predictors of time management. With regard to procrastination on homework and examination preparation, parental expectations and adaptive perfectionism were negative predictors, whereas parental criticism and maladaptive perfectionism were positive predictors.

    "abstract": "The relation between assignment and exam performances of the university students and their academic procrastination behaviors in distance and face-to-face learning environments was investigated in this study. Empirical research carried out both in face-to-face and online environments have generally shown a negative correlation between academic procrastination and academic performance. However, the effect of academic procrastination on assignments in distance learning setting has not been analyzed extensively. To understand the interaction between academic procrastination and the learning environment; assignment and exam performances of eighty-eight university students in face-to-face (FtF) and distance learning (DL) environments were investigated. According to the findings of the study, students' academic procrastination and assignment scores were negatively correlated in both environments but especially in DL setting. Contrary to this, academic procrastination and exam scores were correlated to each other only in FtF environment. On the other hand, there was no correlation between total assignment and exam scores for DL group, while a medium positive correlation was found in FtF group. The findings of binary logical regression analysis demonstrated that predictive value of the DL environment for assignment score is much stronger than academic procrastination behavior of students.",

    "abstract": "On March 12, 2020, Norwegian universities closed campus areas and reorganised teaching to digital environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a sample of 8,907 university students, we investigated how aspects of students' self-regulation were affected by their motivation, perceived stress, working conditions, and remote teaching offered in the new and challenging situation. Specifically, we assumed that self-regulation in terms of time management, procrastination, effort regulation, and time for independent studies might be affected. Analyses based on structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that motivation significantly positively predicted time management and effort regulation and that procrastination negatively predicted time management and effort regulation. Students' perceived stress increased both procrastination and independent study time, whereas remote teaching only weakly reduced procrastination. Students' physical working conditions slightly affected time management. An important finding of the study is the minor impact of students' attendance of remote classes on self-regulation.",

    "abstract": "When students procrastinate, they divert time from academics toward other activities, returning to academics at a later time. Active procrastination is a departure from the form of procrastination defined by scholars as passive (i.e., avoidant, maladaptive) in nature. Hensley selected the methodology (phenomenology) in order to undertake an in-depth study of active procrastination via the experiences and reflections of a small group of participants with first-hand knowledge of the phenomenon. Findings revealed three major themes about active procrastination: (1) Purposeful delay facilitated greater efficiency (I'm good at it); (2) was done systematically (I've learned I can); and (3) was reinforced by appealing academic and social outcomes (It's worth it). Findings also revealed several reasons for students' commitment to procrastination that included active procrastinators ability to complete assignments efficiently, attain acceptable grades, and advance social connections. Drawbacks identified included terms of stress, surface-level learning, and feelings of regret and guilt. Acknowledging the delicate balance between procrastination's draws and drawbacks, implications for practice relate to both educational environments and support for self-directed change.",

The goal of the present study was to examine the relation between student research procrastination and two important data quality issues--careless responding and measurement noninvariance. Data gathered from university students across two semesters tentatively indicated that procrastination is related to low-quality survey data. Procrastination was slightly more problematic for certain data quality issues (measurement noninvariance) than others (careless responding). These relations, however, were small and contingent on how procrastination and careless responding were measured. Accordingly, it seems more beneficial for researchers to select a sampling window that supports their research goals and statistical power requirements rather than select a sampling window that attempts to minimize careless survey responding or other measurement issues.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Previous studies indicated that more than 70% university students committed academic procrastination, and one of the most prominent factors is learned helplessness, the perception that one is incapable of finishing tasks well. It was also hypothesized that when students believe that they are in control of their own events, their learned helplessness will not significantly predict their academic procrastination. This current study aims to test the hypothesis whether internal locus of control mediates the relationship between learned helplessness and academic procrastination among university students. Method: A total of 240 university students were randomly recruited to participate in this current study. Duttweiller's Internal Control Scale was utilized to measure the internal locus of control, Pure Procrastination Scale (adapted for academic setting) was employed to measure the academic procrastination level and Learned Helplessness Scale was used to measure the level of learned helplessness among the participants. Multiple regression with PROCESS macros was employed to analyze the data. Results: Results indicated that learned helplessness significantly predicted internal locus of control, and that internal locus of control was a significant predictor of academic procrastination. These results support the mediational hypothesis. Learned helplessness was no longer a significant predictor of academic procrastination after controlling for the internal locus of control, consistent with full mediation. Approximately 21% of the variance in academic procrastination can be explained by the predictors. Indirect coefficient was significant. Learned helplessness was associated with approximately 0.15 points higher academic procrastination scores as mediated by internal locus of control. Discussion and Conclusion: Internal locus of control fully mediates the influence of learned helplessness on academic procrastination. In other words, when students believe that they are in control of their events, the less likely they will procrastinate doing their tasks due to helplessness they have learned. Findings of this study suggested that procrastination in academic setting occurred due to the perception of helplessness that have been learned over time; nevertheless, the influence will not be that deteriorating towards the students when they believe that they are responsible and in control of their events.",

The relationships between procrastination, disorganisation, the forethought phase of self-regulated learning (SRL), academic performance and self-regulation failure are addressed. Self-report scales were used to assess procrastination, disorganisation, and forethought. Three hypotheses about the relationships between these dimensions were tested. The first is that disorganisation and procrastination are two distinct constructs; it is argued that they represent two routes via which self-regulation failure can be manifested. The second is that disorganisation and procrastination have a negative impact on academic performance; the results obtained showed that only disorganisation had a negative impact on academic performance. The third is that the implementation of high-quality processes during the forethought phase is a safeguard against disorganisation and procrastination.",

    "abstract": "Academic procrastination generates several problems and negative consequences both individually and collectively: low student performance, increased stress, negative effects on physical and mental health, and general waste of resources. Therefore, it demands to be studied and understood in its different forms, so that mitigating mechanisms can be developed. The current work seeks to analyse the phenomenon of academic procrastination within postgraduate students registered for the Management Postgraduate Program in a Brazilian Federal University, in order to identify strategies, techniques and tools utilised by the students to overcome procrastination as well as its relation with the concepts of self-regulation and self-efficacy. The current research is descriptive with a qualitative nature, adopting a phenomenological approach through thematic analysis in order to bring to light the experiences and perceptions of individuals from their own perspectives, challenging structural or normative assumptions. In total, 24 students, 12 from the master's degree program and 12 from the doctorate program in Management were interviewed. As a result, it was noticed that there are some overall inferences that can be taken from the narratives, outlining the phenomenon of academic procrastination and its relations with the concepts of self-regulation and self-efficacy, which led to reinforce the notion that the central elements to understand and specifically combat procrastination are related to the concepts of self-efficacy and self-regulation, which have a considerable influence on students' motivation, behaviour and habits. The research has also pointed to some key strategies, techniques and tools that can be utilised to support further applied research as well as to guide the faculty in supporting the students to overcome or mitigate the procrastination impulse, such as use of goal orientation, visual tools, and academic support starting with undergraduate degrees. The work has an original contribution as no research has been made on that topic utilising qualitative data through a phenomenological approach, which opens a vast and new path for future research.",

A mediational framework was utilized to examine the associations among procrastination, EFs, and four ADHD symptoms domains. Results: Results indicated that both procrastination and GPA correlated with EFs and three ADHD symptom domains. While EFs mediated the association between procrastination and ADHD symptoms, follow-up analyses suggested that self-management of time and organization/problem-solving are the specific pathways through which procrastination is indirectly associated with ADHD symptoms.

The general tendency toward delaying academic tasks has been conceptualized as academic procrastination in academic setting. It is a prevalent issue among students and a numerous students have to deal with it at almost all stage of education, because of its negative consequences such as academic failure and poorer well-being. The current study examined the gender differences in relation to academic procrastination, academic performance and academic life satisfaction. Method: The participants for this study were 441 undergraduate students (49.4% of female and 50.6% of male). Aitken procrastination inventory, Academic satisfaction scale and Demographic information form were used to gather data. Results: The results noticed that academic procrastination was negatively related with academic performance and academic life satisfaction. Male students had higher level academic procrastination and lower level of academic performance and academic life satisfaction. The MANOVA and Hierarchical Regression analyses displayed that gender moderated the relationship between academic procrastination, academic performance and academic life satisfaction. Discussion and Conclusion: The current study suggests that male students are more vulnerable to destructive effect of academic procrastination in terms of academic performance and academic life satisfaction.",

Pearson correlation analysis showed academic procrastination and test anxiety to be positively correlated. Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated that academic procrastination at Time 1 predicted test anxiety at Time 2, while test anxiety at Time 1 did not predict academic procrastination at Time 2. Within the limits of the design, we found that academic procrastination may lead to an increase in test anxiety, but test anxiety did not predict the future level of academic procrastination. It is recognised that the relationship between anxiety and procrastination is complicated. It is suggested that a focus on interventions for academic procrastination may help to reduce students' test anxiety, but not necessarily vice versa.",

    "abstract": "This study explores academic procrastination among postgraduate distance learners, a topic that has received limited attention. Through qualitative interviews with participants, the authors conducted thematic analysis on their experiences. Three overarching themes emerged: perception, reasons, and reflection of academic procrastination among distance learners. Notably, participants frequently procrastinated, primarily due to study-life balance challenges. Surprisingly, participants expressed overall satisfaction with their academic performance despite procrastination tendencies. They considered procrastination a conscious choice, prioritizing other life commitments over studying. This study sheds light on the influence of external factors on procrastination behavior in distance learning. The findings suggest that academic procrastination is prevalent among distance learning students, with study-life balance being a significant predictor. Participants' satisfaction with their academic performance suggests that procrastination may be a deliberate choice. This research highlights the need for tailored interventions to address procrastination in distance education settings.",

    "abstract": "Poor academic performance is known to be linked to the tendency to procrastinate. The latter is thought to reflect deficits in effort regulation and study time management (i.e. learning-related resources), but some recent results have suggested that it could stem from psychological inflexibility. The main objective of the present study was thus to ascertain whether effort regulation, study time management, and psychological (in)flexibility predict variations in French students' academic procrastination. The results of an online survey among 259 first-year humanities and social sciences students revealed that 42.4% of the variance in procrastination was predicted by effort regulation and study time management, and 4% by psychological inflexibility. There was also a negative relationship between academic performance and procrastination. These results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of implementing interventions at the start of university to promote academic success and student wellbeing.",

Although past findings have shown that procrastination negatively relates to academic achievement, no study has examined the influence of procrastination on the grade trajectory of students during this critical academic transition. Therefore, our main goal was to use a prospective design to examine the potentially detrimental role of procrastination on the grade trajectory from high school to the first year at university. We also examined the influence of procrastination over and above five demographic and socio-economic control variables. A sample of 269 first-year university students completed a procrastination questionnaire during their first semester at university. The official grades at three time points were obtained via the Registrar's Office: (1) the average grade of the last year of high school; (2) the average grade of the first semester at university; and (3) the average grade of the second semester at university. Results of piecewise multilevel growth modeling revealed that higher procrastination was associated with a larger grade decrease from high school to the first semester at university, which was maintained during the second semester at university even after considering demographic and socio-economic control variables. This study underscores that procrastination is a risk factor that tends to exacerbate the achievement difficulties experienced by students during the transition from high school to university.",

    "abstract": "Time management is crucial to success in online courses in which students can schedule their learning on a flexible basis. Procrastination is largely viewed as a failure of time management and has been linked to poorer outcomes for students. Past research has quantified the extent of students' procrastination by defining single measures directly from raw logs of student activity. In this work, we use a probabilistic mixture model to allow different types of behavioral patterns to naturally emerge from clickstream data and analyze the resulting patterns in the context of procrastination. Moreover, we extend our analysis to include measures of student regularity--how consistent the procrastinating behaviors are--and construct a composite Time Management Score (&quot;TM&quot;). Our results show that mixture modeling is able to unveil latent types of behavior, each of which is associated with a level of procrastination and its regularity. Overall, students identified as non-procrastinators tend to perform significantly better. Within non-procrastinators, higher levels of regularity signify better performance, while this may be the opposite for procrastinators. [For the full proceedings, see ED593090.]",

    "abstract": "Studies show that many students struggle with properly organizing their academic activities; what makes things even worse is that up to 90% of students are at least part-time procrastinators. In order to clarify how these students could be supported, the article at hand deals with the influences and possible benefits of implementation intentions in an academic learning context and substantiates the literature discussion with data collected among students. Aiming at studying the antecedents of academic performance from a cognitive perspective, the research complements an extended form of the Theory of Planned Behaviour by integrating procrastination and experience. Unlike many other studies, this paper does not focus on reasons for nor different forms of procrastination, but rather develops a comprehensive framework for understanding academic learning. A structural equation modelling approach is applied for this purpose using an empirical data base. For the outcome of this research different hypotheses are investigated especially in reference to implementation intentions. In the majority of cases the theories presented during the literature review can be substantiated with the empirical data used for the study. Key findings are the significant influences of goal intentions, as well as experience, and their positive effect on implementation intentions. Furthermore, the negative influence of procrastination is underlined by the results of the paper and identified as a major problem for college students. Other findings of the paper are the effects of subjective norms and PBC (Perceived Behaviour Control) on the formation of goal intentions. Nevertheless, the study brings up several further questions and identifies areas where research should be deepened, that is behaviour itself.",

There is evidence that students' future time perspective negatively affected students' academic procrastination.

On the one hand, most attention was paid to older students such as undergraduates rather than primary students. On the other hand, we still know little about the mechanism of their relationship. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of students' positive emotion between their future time perspective and academic procrastination. A total of 185 (92are boys and 93 are girls) primary students completed measures self-report in the study. Correlational results showed that future time perspective positively correlated positive emotion, negatively associated with academic procrastination, and positive emotion negatively linked to academic procrastination. Bootstrapped mediation results showed positive emotion partially mediated the relationship between future time perspective and academic procrastination.

Quantitative findings revealed an intermediate-high level of procrastination, particularly in relation to writing assignments, exam preparations, and weekly reading tasks, while attendance tasks and general school activities elicited lower procrastination levels. Further analysis elucidated a substantial negative correlation between procrastination behaviors and both academic engagement and self-confidence, indicating the pernicious influence of this pervasive phenomenon on students' academic experiences. Qualitative insights garnered through thematic analysis explicated the complex reasons behind procrastination, including being overwhelmed by intricate tasks, lack of genuine interest, competitive milieu, insecurities, distractions, cultural and familial pressures, and struggles with time management, prioritization, and perfectionism. Furthermore, inadequate mentorship and anxiety surrounding future career prospects emerged as significant contributors to procrastination. Evidently, this detrimental factor not only impeded postgraduates' academic immersion but also eroded their self-confidence, exacerbating the detrimental repercussions on their scholarly performance. Thus, the findings underscore the imperative for targeted interventions, encompassing mentorship, time management skills, and emotional support, to mitigate the deleterious effects of procrastination on Chinese postgraduates' academic engagement and self-confidence.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination could be conceptualized as a self-regulation failure. However, it is still not clear what type of self-regulation processes are precisely underlying the students' tendency to procrastinate. The main objective of our study was therefore to predict variations in academic procrastination by considering two constructs related to self-regulation: motivational factors (i.e., achievement goals), and learning strategies: deep learning cognitive strategies--Elaboration and Critical thinking--, effort regulation management. The results of an online study on 249 first-year humanities and social sciences French students showed that 30% of the variance in procrastination was predicted positively by avoidance goals and negatively by effort regulation management. The effort regulation management strategy alone contributed to 24% of the variance in procrastination. Furthermore, the results confirmed the negative relationship between academic performance and procrastination tendency. Added together, these results support the conceptualization of procrastination as a self-regulation failure and specially of learning such as effort regulation management. Results are discussed in relation to possible interventions that aim to reduce procrastination in order to promote academic success and students' well-being.",

Method: Basis for the research was a survey (N = 204) which investigated university students' (research participants) exam revision. In 2010, 1,149 German engineering students with an average age of 22.5 years received written questionnaires. 204 students were included in the overall evaluation. I used a structural equation modeling path analysis method to examine the possible relations between the above mentioned variables. Results: The results show that the determinant examination experience has a significant and substantial influence on implementation intention, whereas goal intention hasn't. This influence is also relevant with regard to the determination procrastination. Discussion: Based on the results, that examination experience influences students' exam revision more than expected by the &quot;Theory of Planned Behavior&quot; model. I concluded that more examination experience could be an opportunity to reduce the intention-behavior-gap. Furthermore, it could be stated that the development of implementation intention is promoted by goal intention and examination experience. A unilateral focus on goal intention is not reasonable. Examination experience can have a positive impact on procrastination behavior. In addition, it could be stated, that a lack or lower level of methodological skills or examination experience can be decisive for study success. With regard to the determination action control no influence was detected.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to study the mediation role of locus of control on the impact of learned helplessness on students' academic procrastination. Studies reported that more than 70% university students procrastinate, and one of the causes is the perception that one is vulnerable or helpless in finishing the procrastinate tasks. It was hypothesized that internal locus of control iLOC can reduce the effect if the learned helplessness (LH) on academic procrastination. Data was collected from 60 university students by utilizing instruments such as Duttweiller's Internal Control Scale, Pure Procrastination Scale (adapted for academic setting) and Learned Helplessness Scale. Multiple regression with Process add-on showed that full mediation occurred; the prediction of LH on procrastination became insignificant when iLOC is controlled. In other words, when students believe that they are in control of their events, the less likely they will procrastinate doing their tasks due to helpless feeling.",

    "abstract": "Women and girls around the world face significant barriers in participating in health care decisions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Despite growing interest in shared decision-making (SDM), little is known about its implementation in these countries, and no rigorous assessment of the decision-making needs of women and girls in these contexts has been conducted. There is little SDM training and there are few decision-support tools (DSTs) specifically designed for health care decision-making by women and girls in these countries. DSTs (paper or digital) present options and probabilities and help users articulate their values and preferences. We aim to codevelop an SDM resource platform, including locally relevant DSTs and instructional materials, to support SDM with women and girls in Brazil, Cameroon, and Senegal. We will conduct a 4-phase participatory research project. We will use the Gender-Based Analysis Plus tool to support inclusive participatory research throughout the study. First, we will follow the Integrated Knowledge Translation framework to form a local steering committee in each country, including patients and community representatives, health and social service professionals, and decision-makers. Second, we will follow the Ottawa Decision Support Framework to conduct individual interviews and focus groups to identify the decision-making needs of women and girls. We will include 20 women and girls, along with their family members, 15 health and social service professionals, and 15 representatives of community-based organizations in each country (n=150). The Double Diamond human-centered design framework will be used to codevelop a digital SDM resource platform where DSTs and instructional materials for SDM training can be made accessible. Finally, we will assess the scalability of the platform by using the Innovation Scalability Self-Administered Questionnaire. We will report our study by using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guideline and the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public. Financial support for this project was received on February 1, 2023. This protocol was submitted during data collection but before analysis. Data collection began in January 2025. By July 2025, 92 of the 150 participants had been recruited. We expect to publish our results in December 2026. Ultimately, more women and girls from low- and middle-income countries will be involved in health care decisions, and more clinical teams will be able to integrate SDM into their care practices. The local steering committees will ensure equitable partnerships and the SDM resource platform will promote more inclusive approaches to SDM worldwide. The scalability assessment will help us plan to expand the impact of the platform to other regions. DERR1-10.2196/78618.",

J Strength Cond Res 39(11): 1216-1234, 2025-Resistance training (RT) leads to several health and performance benefits for a variety of people, including ball-sport athletes, occupational athletes, general population lifters, and elderly adults. Despite these well-established effects, a surprisingly high percentage of adults do not participate in consistent RT (&#x223c;80%), and several cite \"perceived lack of time\" as their primary barrier to RT. Superset training, which involves performing 2 or more consecutive sets of different exercises separated by short rest intervals, presents a time-efficient RT modality that reduces session duration by &#x223c;50% compared with traditional RT (TRAD). Several applications of superset training exist, but this review focuses exclusively on the acute and chronic effects of agonist-antagonist paired sets (AAPS), reciprocal supersets (RSS), and total-body supersets (TBSS). The literature is particularly heterogeneous in its definitions, dependent variables, methodologies, and results, but acute data have generally demonstrated that muscle activation and training volume do not differ between supersets and TRAD. By contrast, power production is typically greater during TRAD, while training density, hormonal responses, blood lactate, energy expenditure, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and perceived exertion are greater during supersets. Exceptions exist, but chronic data generally indicate that supersets and TRAD lead to similar adaptations for endurance, hypertrophy, power, and strength. Considering the superior training density of AAPS, RSS, and TBSS, we tentatively conclude that superset programs deliver similar adaptations as TRAD in a more time-efficient manner.",

    "abstract": "Suspension MDCK cells are a substrate for producing influenza A virus (IAV) and typically show very high virus yields compared to other animal cells. Due to the significant heterogeneity within cell populations, studying and comparing clonal cell lines with regard to specific properties, such as superior growth or higher productivity, could facilitate process optimization. In this study, we analyzed the expressed proteins of two clonal cell lines to identify intrinsic characteristics of effective IAV producers. We compared proteome changes in two human IAV PR8 (H1N1, A/PR/8/34) infected monoclonal suspension MDCK cell lines: C59, a low-yield IAV producer with fast cell growth and small cell diameter, and C113, a high-yield IAV producer with average cell growth and large cell diameter. We examined growth rate, size, metabolism and IAV production. A total of 5177 host cell proteins were detected in both cell lines using DIA-PASEF mode with a TimsTOFpro mass spectrometer. Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that fatty acid oxidation and branched-chain amino acid degradation were upregulated in highly productive cells. In contrast, steroid biosynthesis and DNA replication were more active in faster-growing cells. Following infection, 122 proteins were significantly upregulated (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, log2-fold change &#x2265;1) in the high-producing cell line. These proteins were associated with membrane trafficking, interactions with the IAV-NS1 protein and virus production. Additionally, 98 proteins associated with antiviral pathways such as the proto-oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase MET and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling were downregulated (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, log2-fold change &#x2264;1). In the cell line that produced lower IAV PR8 titers, 77 proteins were downregulated and 57 were upregulated after infection. RNA metabolism appeared to be downregulated, while the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the stress response were both upregulated. In the high-yield C113 clone, only proteins associated with apoptosis and the target of rapamycin kinase (TOR) were expressed following infection. This may indicate a more effective release of virus particles. A comparison of intracellular IAV PR8 protein levels demonstrated that M1 and NA levels were 4-fold and 8-fold higher, respectively, for the high-yield C113 cell line. These findings again suggest an improved virus release.",

    "abstract": "The phosphoprotein 65 (pp65, pUL83) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) serves several functions during the viral life cycle. It is one of the most abundant constituents of the virion tegument and the major component of subviral particles termed Dense Bodies. It is also one of several tegument proteins that mediate the subversion of cellular antiviral defence functions like the induction of IFNs. It is also involved in the transcriptional activation of the major immediate early IE1/IE2 gene. Despite its strong nucleophilic nature, pp65 is found in the cytoplasm at late stages of infection. We have previously shown that the nuclear retention phenotype of a mutated pp65 is associated with a distinct deficit in viral productivity. In this study, we generated HCMV mutant viruses in which the nuclear localization signals (nls) of pp65 were mutated, thus preventing nuclear entry and pp65 shuttling. Since the genetic manipulation of UL83 led to the deregulation of the adjacent pp71 gene in initial experiments, we chose to express pp65 with mutated nls from a distant locus within the genome of a TB40/e strain derivative. This virus, termed v65stop-pp65<i>nls</i>, was significantly impaired in its capacity to produce infectious progeny. Using knockout fibroblast cells for the DNA sensors IFI16 or cGAS, no differences were seen when progeny production was compared between v65stop-pp65<i>nls</i> and a strain expressing wt pp65. Thus, differences in the known subversive effect on these DNA sensors could not account for the differences seen in productivity. Surprisingly, the upload of pp65 into virions and the synthesis of subviral Dense Bodies were abrogated by the mutation of its nls. Although an impairment of pp65 interaction with other proteins by the mutations cannot be excluded, the data suggest that the migration of pp65 through the nucleus was important for HCMV progeny production and packaging.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is recognized in Life's Essential 8&#x2122; as an important behavioral factor for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health. While sleep duration is currently the focus in Life's Essential 8&#x2122;, sleep health is multidimensional and encompasses regularity, satisfaction, next-day alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration. In addition to sleep, circadian factors have also been implicated in cardiovascular health. For example, shift work, which results in significant circadian misalignment, is associated with poor cardiovascular health. This review will describe methods for measuring, analyzing, and interpreting sleep and circadian rhythms in humans. Subjective and objective measurements of sleep are not always concordant and may reflect distinct constructs. Therefore, both subjective and objective sleep measurements are discussed. Assessment of the circadian system in humans typically relies on the measurement of circadian biomarkers (i.e., melatonin, core body temperature, and/or cortisol) during rigorous and burdensome research protocols. However, novel approaches are being developed to estimate circadian parameters with lower cost and participant burden. This review aims to inform cardiovascular scientists and clinicians of common practices in the assessment of sleep and circadian rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade have secured its role in and beyond the radiology reading room. AI is increasingly embedded in imaging workflows, either directly by influencing practice with provision of AI results to radiologists for interpretive use cases or indirectly by aiding in noninterpretive use cases for image optimization or workflow efficiency. Although AI solutions show potential to change paradigms for how radiologists practice, the ability to effectively leverage AI will depend on radiologists' AI literacy. Historically, AI implementation has been facilitated by those with prior technical experience, while radiologists accommodate newly deployed tools in existing imaging workflows. However, investing in AI literacy enables wider implementation by empowering radiologists to identify practical limitations that may be overlooked, ensuring safe and effective integration in practice. This article is the first in a primer series providing a foundation in AI literacy for radiologists. \"Looking under the hood\" of an AI algorithm may be daunting, but understanding how it works at a foundational level is key for making informed decisions using AI as a tool, enabling an understanding of when AI may fail or be prone to bias. This article focuses on practical considerations at each stage of AI development. The following articles in this series will build on this content by examining paradigms for delivery to end users and their interaction with AI results, explaining barriers to AI integration from the perspective of various imaging workflow stakeholders (eg, radiologists, technologists, picture archiving and communication system administrators, imaging informaticists, patients, staff in administrative and executive roles, and others), and detailing postdeployment considerations for AI monitoring and regulation after model procurement and deployment in practice.",

    "abstract": "Workplace mobbing affects approximately 20% of workers worldwide, yet about 70% of victims do not report it, limiting the full understanding of its true impact. While previous research has established its association with mental health disorders, the broader burden-including burden of disease (BOD), cost of illness (COI), and productivity loss (PL)-remains underexplored. This scoping review aims to address this gap by mapping the existing literature on the BOD and economic costs associated with mobbing-related mental health disorders. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A systematic search in National Library of Medicine's bibliographic database (MEDLINE), Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS), Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases (until June 30, 2021) identified primary studies and reviews assessing BOD, COI, or PL in adults exposed to workplace mobbing. Articles were screened independently by two reviewers in two phases (title/abstract and full-text review). Data extraction focused on study characteristics and key findings, which were categorized into predefined thematic domains. Fourteen studies published between 2008 and 2020 met the selection criteria (71.4% primary studies, 28.6% reviews). The definition of mobbing varied across studies, and frequently, different terms were used interchangeably. None of the included studies quantified disease burden using standard metrics such as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Instead, PL was assessed indirectly through absenteeism, presenteeism, and work performance assessments. Mobbing is a significant occupational health issue with substantial mental health implications, yet research on its economic and disease burden remains limited. The heterogeneity in definitions and methodologies across studies hampers comparability and synthesis. Future research should adopt standardized definitions and employ robust burden-of-disease frameworks, such as DALYs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), to better quantify the impact of mobbing on mental health and work productivity.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to analyse the association between executive function (EF) and depressive symptoms (DS) among college students and explore the roles played by procrastination behaviour (PB) and sleep quality (SQ) in this relationship. Convenience sampling was adopted in this study. A total of 1618 college students (658 male, 960 female; mean age = 18.987 &#xb1; 1.305 years) completed self-administered questionnaires to assess DS and related factors. The Geurten-Questionnaire of Executive Functioning in Chinese College Students, General Procrastination Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Self-rating Depression Scale were used for the measurements. Normality test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman correlation analysis, multicollinearity tests and Model 6 of the PROCESS macro program were employed for data analysis. The median score for DS was 47 (interquartile range: 37-58). Place of residence and being an only child were influencing factors of DS among college students (p &lt; 0.05). Significant correlations were observed among executive function deficits (EFD), PB, sleep disturbances (SD) and DS in pairwise comparisons (r = 0.380-0.570, p &lt; 0.01). Analyses revealed that the total indirect effect (0.178) accounted for 31.34% of the total effect (0.568). The indirect effect of EFD on DS through PB was 0.071 (95% CI = 0.042-0.101). The indirect effect of EFD on DS through SD was 0.072 (95% CI = 0.054-0.093). Meanwhile, the mediating effect through PB and SD was 0.035 (95% CI = 0.023-0.046). A relatively high prevalence of DS was observed among college students. EFD influenced the DS of college students through the mediating or chain mediating effects of PB and SD, thus providing a theoretical basis for improving the mental health level of college students.",

    "abstract": "To report the progress made from evaluating the fourth cohort of a year-long global leadership mentoring programme, pairing early career nurse leaders with more established leaders across different global regions. Additionally, groups of five pairs, facilitated by an experienced coordinator, were used. Recent evidence reinforces the value of formal structured mentorship programmes to support nurse leadership development, organisational efficiency and patient outcomes. A survey approach using both pre- and post-survey questionnaires was refined from previous cohorts and reported using the STROBE checklist. Using closed questions supported by three open-ended questions, participants focused on their expectations, cultural understanding and leadership. Data were collected between 2021 and 2023, from a total of 26 pairs and analysed utilising descriptive statistics and thematic analysis using the mixed-methods appraisal tool. Data were merged to form the three themes of commitment, confidence and cultural competence and their impact on global leadership. The majority of dyads gained considerably from the programme, both within their pairs but also in the small coordinator groups, gaining a broader perspective and wider network of global leaders to connect with long after completion of the programme. The use of small coordinator groups enhances the already successful individual global mentoring. More work to develop policy discussions and accessible connections in these small groups potentially enhances cultural competence and leadership skills. Individual mentoring supported by small facilitator groups could be considered as a policy imperative by the International Council of Nurses and National Nursing Councils to encourage wider networking opportunities and learning across different cultures in a secure environment to prepare for leadership on a global stage and enhance care standards.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization defines burnout as 'the syndrome of chronic workplace stress that cannot be successfully managed'. Due to daily contact with individuals having communication disorders and their families, along with stressful working conditions, professional devaluation, occupational overload and poor management, speech and language therapists (SLTs) are at risk of experiencing burnout. The burnout level of SLTs working with such client profiles and under such an intense workload is a matter of curiosity. This study aims to determine the burnout levels of Speech and Language Therapists in T&#xfc;rkiye and to investigate the related factors. Consisting of 138 women and 29 men, a total of 167 SLTs participated in the study. Their responses to the Demographic Form and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 software. Descriptive statistics, including mean, frequency, standard deviation and range, were employed to characterize the participants. To investigate the differences among the variables, independent groups t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc analyses (Tukey, LSD) were conducted. The results indicate that the percentage of the SLTs with moderate-level burnout in the Emotional Exhaustion subscale was 43.1% while 62.3% were determined to have low-level burnout on the Depersonalization subscale. Furthermore, 74.9% of the participants reported low-level burnout on the Low Sense of Personal Accomplishment subscale. The factors identified to significantly impact burnout levels are gender, age, educational background, work setting, length of professional experience, monthly income and concerns about shifting jobs (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, variables such as the city, the number of workdays per week, the frequency of weekly assessments or therapy sessions, and the way of commuting to the workplace do not significantly influence burnout levels (p &gt; 0.05). Although the current study indicates that SLTs do not experience high levels of burnout, a potential risk is suggested. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness about burnout among SLTs and to implement preventive measures. What is already known on the subject The World Health Organization (WHO) defines burnout as \"the syndrome of chronic workplace stress that is not successfully managed\". The addition of three items to the existing definition by WHO aims to raise awareness about burnout: the presence of feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one's work or negative feelings towards one's career, and decreased professional productivity. Burnout among SLTs can be attributed to factors such as stressful working conditions, professional devaluation, occupational overload and poor management, as well as the challenges, relationships and expectations of clients and their families. Although there are some studies regarding burnout levels of SLTs and related factors, there is no study in T&#xfc;rkiye where the field of speech and language therapy is emerging. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A total of 43.1% of SLTs in T&#xfc;rkiye have a moderate level of Emotional Exhaustion. While 62.3% were determined to have low-level burnout on the Depersonalization, 74.9% reported low-level burnout on the Low Sense of Personal Accomplishment subscale. Gender, age, educational background, work setting, length of professional experience, monthly income and concerns about shifting jobs significantly impact the burnout levels. On the other hand, city, the number of workdays per week, the frequency of weekly assessments or therapy sessions, and the way of commuting to the workplace do not significantly influence burnout levels. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? As a result of this research, the participant will be able to summarize the burnout levels of speech and language therapists, see the factors that lead to burnout, and gain awareness of this issue. Turkish SLTs are facing with moderate level of Emotional Exhaustion, low-level Depersonalization, and Low Sense of Personal Accomplishment. Gender, age, educational background, work setting, length of professional experience, monthly income, and concerns about shifting jobs significantly affect the burnout. Although it is found that SLTs in T&#xfc;rkiye do not experience high levels of burnout, it is vital to raise awareness about burnout, its consequences, and preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an innovative and minimally invasive approach that has attracted considerable attention and interest in the medical community in recent years. The technique is primarily used to treat tumors and has received official approval for the management of several types of cancer. The process involves the injection of specialized light-sensitive materials into the body. Subsequently, when light of an optimal wavelength (the wavelength at which the photosensitizer is best absorbed and penetrates the tissue) is directed at these materials, it causes the production of reactive oxygen species. These reactive oxygen species play an important role in inducing cellular damage that ultimately leads to the death of cancer cells. Therefore, this treatment modality is based on three fundamental principles. This review comprehensively examines the fundamental principles governing PDT, with a specific focus on photosensitizer design, irradiation parameters, and tumor microenvironment oxygenation. A critical analysis of each component is provided, underscoring their collective importance in optimizing PDT efficacy for oncological applications.",

    "abstract": "Students in higher education often face dual academic and non-academic demands, which require the ability to manage time, energy, and responsibilities in a balanced manner. The inability to set priorities often triggers academic procrastination, namely the tendency to delay completing college assignments, which results in decreased academic achievement. Therefore, students need to have a clear scale of priorities to balance college activities with organisational involvement or other additional activities. One concrete form of this priority scale is goal setting, which plays a role in helping students formulate goals, manage responsibilities, and minimise academic procrastination behaviour. This study aims to analyse the effect of goal setting on the academic procrastination of students who participate in organisations. The method used in this study is quantitative with a type of influence research. The sample consisted of 280 students involved in organisations and was selected through a simple random sampling technique. Data were analysed using simple linear regression. Based on the simple regression analysis results, it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted. This indicates that goal setting (X) affects academic procrastination (Y) in students who participate in organisations. This is supported by the F-count value of 222.019 with a significance level of 0.001, which means it is less than 0.05. Therefore, it can be concluded that goal setting (X) influences academic procrastination (Y).",

    "abstract": "Previous research has revealed a moderate and positive correlation between procrastination and impulsivity. However, little is known about why these two constructs are related. In the present study, we used behavior-genetics methodology to test three predictions derived from an evolutionary account that postulates that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: (a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation. These predictions were confirmed. First, both procrastination and impulsivity were moderately heritable (46% and 49%, respectively). Second, although the two traits were separable at the phenotypic level ( r = .65), they were not separable at the genetic level ( rgenetic = 1.0). Finally, variation in goal-management ability accounted for much of this shared genetic variation. These results suggest that procrastination and impulsivity are linked primarily through genetic influences on the ability to use high-priority goals to effectively regulate actions.",

Participants (N = 139) completed questionnaires assessing recent goal failure, procrastination, emotion regulation and FTP, then coded as either High or Low in FTP. Results support hypotheses that despite goal failure, those high in FTP procrastinated less, planned more and used more cognitive reappraisal strategies. Further, procrastination and cognitive reappraisal significantly predicted FTP scores. Thus, goal failure may be an essential part of learning how to achieve high self‐regulation goals. However, it may discourage some from trying again, particularly those low in FTP. Findings suggest the FTP may offer a strategy to aid attainment of important high self‐regulated, long‐term goals.",

Afterward, desirable values for performance measures were determined based on the equations and relationships obtained through SES and were optimized by goal programming method.\n\n\nFindings\nBy applying the proposed method, a clearer picture of the associations among strategic objectives is obtained and the influence of strategic objectives on one another is determined. Afterward, optimal values for strategic objectives are determined to achieve the organization’s goals.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis paper proposes a framework for constructing a strategy map and setting quantitative targets in the framework of BSC. Indeed, this paper presents a case study to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, SES technique requires a greater amount of data to generate more accurate results. Although the advent of the Information Age has forced organizations’ decision makers to provide sufficient information and data for business analysis, the data requirements are met.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe presented quantitative approach is a supporting approach for improving decision makers’ opinions and enabling them to reach a more accurate picture of the relationships, valuing strategic objectives and achieving strategic goals. This research also presents a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The application and implication of the proposed method in banking services show that the contributions of the paper are not only theoretical, but also practical.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe proposed method provides a novel approach for determining the most appropriate targets and applies a comprehensive and scientific model together with decision makers’ opinions and experiences and has two main contributions: first, the associations among strategic objectives are investigated and obtained in an effective way by conducting the SES for the first time in the framework of BSC. Second, quantitative targets have been determined to help in achieving the long-term goals. This task has been accomplished through a combination of SES, the three-stage least squares regression analysis and optimization by using weighted goal programming method.",

    "abstract": "Abstrak. Perkuliahan yang dilaksanakan secara daring di masa pandemi ternyata berimbas bagi mahasiswa. Pembelajaran jarak jauh membuat perilaku prokrastinasi akademik meningkat. Prokrastinasi akademik merupakan kebiasaan menunda yang berkaitan dengan tugas akademik. Penundaan dilakukan secara sengaja meskipun mahasiswa mengetahui dampak buruk yang dihasilkan melalui perilaku menunda tersebut. Jika dibiarkan, prokrastinasi dapat memberikan pengaruh terhadap penurunan prestasi akademik mahasiswa. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat bagaimana penerapan teknik goal setting dan time management dalam membantu mahasiswa menetapkan prioritas dan fokus. Teknik ini juga memberikan manfaat untuk meminimalkan kecemasan pada tenggat waktu, kurangnya fokus, penundaan, dan kelelahan kerja. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah tipe penelitian kualitatif, dengan sumber data sekunder yang didapatkan dari kajian literatur. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa ada enam langkah dalam penerapan teknik goal setting dan time management. Adapun langkah-langkah tersebut yaitu: clarify your value, setting goals, develop an action plan, evaluate how you spend your time, combating procrastination, and organizing your time. Menerapkan keenam langkah ini secara konsisten dan bersinambungan membuat mahasiswa mampu untuk menciptakan manajemen waktu yang baik. Dengan begitu, mahasiswa bisa menyelesaikan tugas-tugas perkuliahan atau kegiatan yang berkaitan dengan aktivitas akademik secara tepat waktu.Kata Kunci: goal setting, time management, prokrastinasi akademik, pandemi",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the relationship between students’ time management and delays in doing academic assignments while learning online at the Faculty for Teacher Training and Education. This was a quantitative study. The population was students of FKIP UPI YPTK Padang, the Department of Informatics Engineering and of English Education. Purposive sampling was used, with a focus on students who are accustomed to doing online lectures with the Learning Management System (LMS) application in the form of Edmodo and Schoology applications. Data were collected through a questionnaire distributed online via Google Forms. The results showed that the correlation between time management and postponement of academic assignments was 0.6546, which meant that time management had a moderate correlation with academic procrastination. Thus, it can be concluded that students learning online may experience conditions that are less stable for managing their time to work on academic assignments.\r\nKeywords: online learning, time management, academic procrastination",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough goal setting and goal management (GSGM) is a key component of chronic disease management and rehabilitation practice, there is currently no widely used evidence-based intervention system available. This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings and development of a new intervention called MyGoals. MyGoals is designed to guide occupational therapy (OT) practitioners to implement theory-based, client-engaged GSGM for adults with chronic conditions in community-based OT rehabilitation settings.MethodsWe first developed a planning team with two adults with chronic conditions, two clinicians, and two researchers. As a collaborative team, we co-developed MyGoals by following Intervention Mapping (IM) steps 1–4 and incorporating community-based participatory research principles to ensure equitable, ecologically valid, and effective intervention development. In the first step, the planning team conducted a discussion-based needs assessment and a systematic review of current GSGM practice to develop a logic model of the problem. In the second step, the planning team identified performance objectives, intervention target personal determinants, and change objectives, and created a logic model of change and matrics of change objectives. In the third step, the planning team designed MyGoals. Lastly, in the fourth step, the planning team produced, pilot-tested, and refined MyGoals.ResultsThe ultimate goal of the MyGoals intervention is to enable clients to achieve personally meaningful rehabilitation goals. The planning team identified four target determinants (e.g., self-efficacy), six intervention activities (e.g., Education, Reflection, Find My Goals, Make My Goals, Make My Plans, My Progress), eight performance objectives (e.g., List potential goals), and 26 change objectives (e.g., Understand the importance of GSGM). Two pilot tests indicated that MyGoals is feasible for clients and identified areas for improvement. Based on the feedback, minor refinements were made to the MyGoals intervention materials.ConclusionsWe completed rigorous and collaborative IM to develop MyGoals. Establishing the theoretical and developmental foundation for MyGoals sets the groundwork for high-quality, evidence-based GSGM. Future studies on effectiveness and implementation are necessary to refine, translate, and scale MyGoals in rehabilitation practice.",

    "abstract": "In sport, numerous high-pressure situations require athletes to perform motor tasks under temporally constrained circumstances. The present study investigated the effects of time constraints on anxiety, attention, performance, and mechanics of basketball free-throw shooting. Additionally, the potential benefits of goal setting were examined in relation to performance in time-constrained situations. Forty undergraduates (n = 10 elite basketball players, n = 15 experienced, n = 15 inexperienced) attempted free throws in timed, untimed, and goal-oriented conditions. In the timed condition, participants attempted to make as many field goals as possible in 30 s. In the untimed condition, participants attempted the same number of field goals as they did in the timed trial but without a time constraint. In the goal-oriented condition, participants attempted to surpass their highest number of successful field goals while once again under a 30-s time constraint. Participants in the timed condition had the worst field goal percentage (M = 45.20%, SD = 21.96%), while the untimed (M = 55.76%, SD = 21.12%, p &amp;lt; 0.05, d = 0.49) and goal-oriented conditions (M = 55.79%, SD = 22.92%, p &amp;lt; 0.05, d = 0.47) had similar field goal percentages. In addition, joint consistency in the elbow and knee increased during the untimed condition compared to both timed and goal-oriented conditions. Results indicate that a goal-oriented focus may prevent performance declines present in time-constrained situations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractImportance: There is no evidence-based system to guide occupational therapists in implementing theory-based, client-engaged goal setting and goal management. A new system is needed to support high-quality goal setting and goal management.Objective: To determine the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, credibility, and expectancy of a new structured theory-based, client-engaged goal setting and goal management system, called MyGoals, for occupational therapists. We explored MyGoals’ implementation determinants, potential positive outcomes, and comparative advantages.Design: This was a mixed-methods feasibility study.Setting: Community.Participants: Occupational therapists (N = 7).Outcomes and Measures: Acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility were assessed using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM). Credibility and expectancy were assessed with the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ). Semistructured 1:1 interviews were conducted to explore occupational therapy perspectives on MyGoals and its implementation-related factors.Results: MyGoals had high AIM (M = 18.1, SD = 1.9), IAM (M = 17.9, SD = 2.2), FIM (M = 17.3, SD = 2.1) scores and high CEQ Credibility (M = 22.1, SD = 5.0) and Expectancy (M = 20.6, SD = 4.3) scores. Interview data revealed suggestions to improve MyGoals, implementation determinants across the individuals involved, inner setting, and intervention characteristic domains, client- and clinician-related potential positive outcomes, and comparative advantages.Conclusions and Relevance: MyGoals is an acceptable, appropriate, feasible, credible, and promising system to guide occupational therapists in implementing theory-based, client-engaged goal setting and goal management for adults with chronic conditions in community-based rehabilitation.What This Article Adds: MyGoals is an easy-to-use, appealing, and helpful system to support occupational therapists in delivering theory-based goal setting and goal management components and to enable adults with chronic conditions to actively engage in their rehabilitation. This study supports the usefulness of MyGoals in community-based rehabilitation to improve goal setting and goal management quality and personally meaningful rehabilitation goal achievement in this population.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between ethical behavior, productivity, and effectiveness of goal-setting on the performance of non-academic scholars within a university setting. By assessing these key factors, the research aimed to provide meaningful insights into how ethical conduct influences work efficiency, how productivity contributes to task completion and achievement of departmental goals, and how structured goal-setting strategies enhance scholars' performance. The study employed a combination of descriptive correlational, and causal research designs. A sample of 139 selected faculty members and administrative staff who directly engaged with non-academic scholars participated by responding to a survey questionnaire used for data collection.  The findings revealed that ethical behavior significantly influenced scholars’ sense of accountability, work commitment, and adherence to institutional policies. Productivity was found to be strongly associated with task efficiency, quality of output, and effective time management. Furthermore, goal-setting strategies were shown to improve task clarity, motivation, and performance outcomes. The study also underscored the importance of implementing structured evaluation systems. These include policies such as grant readjustment for scholars with attendance issues, performance-based allowances for those who consistently demonstrate excellence and establishment of mentorship programs was recommended to further support and guide scholars in their roles. Overall, the findings offer valuable recommendations for institutions, policymakers, supervisors, faculty, staff, and non-academic scholars aimed at enhancing ethical behavior, increasing productivity, and improving the effectiveness of goal-setting within the university environment.",

    "abstract": "Two recent randomized controlled efficacy trials showed that harm-reduction treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD)-or patient-driven treatment that does not require abstinence and instead supports decreased alcohol-related harm and improved quality of life (QoL)-is efficacious for adults experiencing homelessness and AUD. The present study provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of one component of harm-reduction treatment, participants' harm-reduction goal-setting, within these two trials. Aims of this secondary, dual-trial study (Trial 1 N = 208, Trial 2 N = 86) were to describe participant-generated harm-reduction goals and determine whether aspects of harm-reduction goal-setting predict treatment outcomes. Across both trials, qualitative findings indicated improving QoL, meeting basic needs, improving physical and mental health, and changing drinking behavior were participants' top four goals. Only 2%-6% of goals centered on attaining alcohol abstinence. Regarding quantitative findings, Trial 1 showed statistically significant increases in goals generation over the course of treatment, while proportion of achieved goals stayed constant. In Trial 2, number of goals generated remained constant, while proportion of goals achieved increased. Trial 2 findings showed greater goal generation over time was associated with better physical health-related QoL, and drinking-related goals predicted improved alcohol outcomes. Overall, this secondary, dual-trial study suggests patient-driven goal-setting in harm-reduction treatment is feasible: Participants generated diverse, personalized, and clinically relevant goals. This study built on positive efficacy trial findings, indicating participants' generation of goals was associated with improved treatment outcomes. More research is needed to further understand more nuanced relationships between harm-reduction goal-setting and treatment outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "abstract": "Collaborative goal setting (CGS) is a cornerstone of diabetes self-management support, but little is known about its feasibility and effectiveness during routine care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of an existing CGS intervention when integrated by primary care staff. Using a mixed-methods approach guided by the RE-AIM framework, intervention adoption, implementation, reach, and effectiveness were evaluated over 12&#xa0;months. Three of four sites adopted the CGS intervention, in which 521 patients with type 2 diabetes (9-29&#xa0;% of those targeted) received CGS. For those with suboptimal glycemic control (A1C&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;7.5&#xa0;%), %A1C decreased by 1.1 for those receiving CGS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;204, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) compared to 0.4 for a group who did not (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.23). Practice characteristics influenced adoption and implementation, while isolation of CGS from the remainder of clinical care likely influenced reach and effectiveness. CGS may benefit patients with diabetes, but a lack of integration by practice staff is a key barrier to overcome during implementation.",

Survey data are collected from 135 employees and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results demonstrate participation is directly positively related to goal commitment as well as indirectly via distributive and informational fairness. In addition, the statistical relation between procedural fairness and goal commitment is suppressed: it ranges from significantly positive to significantly negative dependent on what other variables are included in the analyses. As a second contribution, the suppressor phenomenon and its implications are extensively discussed. Suppression mainly occurs when there is much overlap in the independent variables, for instance when multiple control practices are examined simultaneously as systems or packages.\n               JEL Classifications: C18; C20; C30; L84; M12; M41; M52; M54.\n               Data Availability: Data are available via the author until at least five years after publication.",

The importance of assessing the prevalence of procrastination and its associated factors with view to develop “Task and Time Management strategies” to combat procrastination among nursing students are preponderant. Moreover, researches have despite that procrastination tends to be significantly higher among students specially those who have difficulty in time management. Objectives: This study was conducted with an object to assess the prevalence of procrastination and its associated factors with view to develop “Task and Time Management strategies” to combat procrastination among nursing students. Materials and methods: An exploratory study was conducted on 750 nursing students in the year of 2023 in selected nursing institutes of state Punjab. The subjects were selected by using quota sampling technique. Modified Procrastination Assessment Scale – Students given by Linda J. Solomon and Esther D. Rothblum in 1994 for assessing the prevalence of procrastination and its associated factors among nursing students. Data was collected by self report (pen and paper) method. Results: This study revealed that out of 750 students most of the nursing students (mean age ± sd=20.43±1.726) showed moderate level of procrastination i.e., 661(88.1%). Others nursing students have 89 (11.9%) have mild procrastination. In reasons for procrastination majority i.e., 90 (12%) of nursing students gave the reason that they had too many other things to do while 77(10.3%) of nursing students procrastinate due to fear of having bad grades. The significant difference between the prevalence of procrastination and socio demographic variables found to be significance with the gender (p=.000), birth order(p=.002). Conclusion: It has been concluded that the most of the students were found to have moderate procrastination and the major reason for procrastination is that nursing students do not want to face the problems as a result of their avoidance they suffer from more stress and anxiety. Gender and birth order have significant association with prevalence of procrastination. Nursing students need to manage time and divide their tasks according to the priority.",

This goal-setting instrument was carefully developed through three phases. In the first phase, an item pool was generated. In the second phase, a pilot study was carried out with a view to modifying the weak points of the questionnaire. In the third phase, a final version of the questionnaire was distributed among participants for evaluating the practicality. The evaluation of the psychometric properties of the final instrument was made using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), with the validity and reliability being evaluated. The results indicate that the proposed instrument yields satisfactory characteristics and that the theoretical model bears a good fit with the data. The researcher proposes that the instrument presented in this study can provide a more psychometrically sound measure of goal-setting in learning a second language than traditional open-ended questionnaires.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a need for an effective evidence-based system to support high-quality goal setting and goal management implementation. We developed a new system for community-based rehabilitation, MyGoals, along with implementation strategies to support occupational therapists (OTs) in its administration. This study evaluates the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the implementation strategies,Clinician EducationandAudit &amp;amp; Feedback. It also explores whether OTs achieve the change objectives of the MyGoals implementation strategies and MyGoals intervention fidelity.MethodsThis mixed-methods case series study evaluated the MyGoals implementation strategies developed using Implementation Mapping (IM), specifically IM Task 5 – Implementation Outcome Evaluation. Seven OTs and 13 adults with chronic conditions participated in this study. OTs participated in twoClinician Educationsessions, delivered two MyGoals interventions, and participated in twoAudit &amp;amp; Feedbacksessions. We evaluated the implementation strategies using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM), and semi-structured interviews and explored the OTs' self-rated MyGoals change objectives achievement and the intervention fidelity using quantitative MyGoals intervention fidelity measures and interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analyzed by two independent coders using content analysis.ResultsSeven OTs participated in this study (mean years of professional experience = 9.3, SD = 5.9).Clinician EducationandAudit &amp;amp; Feedbackhad high AIM (M = 17.9, SD = 2.7), IAM (M = 17.3, SD = 3.60), and FIM scores (M = 17.3, SD = 3). The OTs also had high mean scores on self-perceived achievement of change objectives and intervention fidelity. Qualitative interviews suggested that the time commitment forClinician Educationis a key barrier to its acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. Participants also provided suggestions on how to improve the strategies (e.g., providing recordedClinician Education, etc.).ConclusionsThe MyGoals implementation strategies are acceptable, appropriate, and feasible to OTs working in community-based rehabilitation. They support OTs in achieving the change objectives necessary to deliver MyGoals completely and competently. Thus, the MyGoals implementation strategies may support clinicians in implementing a theory-based, client-engaged goal setting and goal management for adults with chronic conditions in community-based rehabilitation. This can ultimately help improve the integration of evidence-based interventions into practice.",

    "abstract": "The General background procrastination is a prevalent issue that affects productivity and efficiency in various settings, including work environments. Specific background this behavior can be particularly detrimental among individuals with multiple responsibilities, such as community cadres, who often struggle to manage their time effectively. Knowledge gap despite the recognition of time management as a crucial skill, there is limited research on its impact specifically among community cadres in reducing work procrastination. Aims this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of time management training on the procrastination levels of cadres in a specific area. Results a quantitative experimental approach using a one-group pretest-posttest design was employed, involving 41 active cadres who underwent the training. the findings revealed a notable decrease in procrastination levels, with pretest scores averaging 66.000 and posttest scores averaging 65.000, indicating a positive shift after the intervention. Novelty this research contributes to existing literature by highlighting the potential of targeted time management training in addressing procrastination among community workers. Implications the outcomes suggest that implementing such training could enhance productivity and efficiency among cadres, advocating for broader applications of time management strategies in similar community-based settings to foster improved performance and commitment.\r\nHighlights: \r\n\r\nEffective time management training significantly reduces procrastination levels among cadres.\r\nQuantitative experimental approach utilized for measuring training impact.\r\nFindings advocate for broader applications of time management strategies in community settings.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Procrastination, Training, Cadres, Productivity, Research",

Our theory is based on the trade-off between optimism, which raises anticipatory utility, and objectivity, which promotes efficient actions. We present it in the context of allocating work on a project over time, develop testable implications to contrast it with models assuming time-inconsistent preferences, and compare its predictions to existing evidence on behavior and beliefs. Our predictions are that (i) optimal beliefs are optimistic and time inconsistent; (ii) people optimally exhibit the planning fallacy; (iii) incentives for rapid task completion make beliefs more optimistic and worsen work smoothing, whereas incentives for accurate duration prediction make beliefs less optimistic and improve work smoothing; (iv) without a commitment device, beliefs become less optimistic over time; and (v) in the presence of a commitment device, beliefs may become more optimistic over time, and people optimally exhibit preference for commitment.This paper was accepted by Neng Wang, finance.",

The scientific novelty in the development of the concept of displacement lies in the awareness of local communities of the deprivation of their ownership of land, the right to own and dispose of land and natural resources, and the inability to influence the formation of a territory development strategy.",

    "abstract": "Academic dishonesty undermines the integrity of educational processes and remains a widespread concern in higher education institutions, including those offering distance learning. In this context, identifying the factors that influence students' academic dishonesty behaviors is crucial. This study aims to explore the relationship of academic dishonesty with academic procrastination behaviors, time management skills among distance education students. For this purpose, the study employed a correlational survey model, which is a quantitative research method. The research sample comprised 220 students enrolled in an associate degree program via distance education at a public university, selected using the convenience sampling method. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, Pearson correlation analysis, and stepwise regression analysis. The findings indicate that academic dishonesty behaviors among distance education students are low, while their academic procrastination behaviors and time management skills are at a medium level. The analysis of demographic characteristics revealed varying trends in their effects on academic dishonesty, academic procrastination, and time management skills among the participants. The study found no significant effect of demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, marital status, and employment status, on academic dishonesty. A positive relationship was found between academic procrastination behavior and academic dishonesty behavior; while a negative relationship was observed between time management skills and academic dishonesty. The analyses revealed that academic procrastination behavior and time management skills together predict academic dishonesty behaviors, with the developed model explaining approximately 26&#xa0;% of the total variance in these behaviors. This study aims to address a critical gap in the literature and contribute to the development of academic integrity strategies by examining the relationships between academic dishonesty behaviors, academic procrastination behaviors, and time management skills in distance education.",

Healthy levels of exercise, a good diet and adequate sleep can reduce stress and improve mental well-being outcomes. This study explores the characteristics and effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on teachers' mental well-being, including burnout; discusses directions for future programmes; and aims to identify the nature of evidence and gaps in the research field. Methods: A scoping review was conducted in May 2020 via ERIC, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Education Source, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Scopus databases. The search included relevant peer-reviewed articles on physical activity, nutrition and sleep interventions reporting teachers' mental well-being outcomes. A quality assessment tool was used to appraise the quality and risk of bias of the included studies. Results: Sixteen intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies incorporated physical activity into the intervention; however, only four included aspects of nutrition or sleep. No studies reported only nutrition or sleep interventions alone. The heterogeneity of interventions and their reported outcomes makes comparisons difficult. In general, the quality of the included studies was low due to small sample sizes, poor study design and incomplete reporting of information. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence suggests lifestyle interventions can improve mental well-being outcomes for teachers; however good-quality research is needed to improve the evidence base. Future interventions should have stronger research designs and larger sample sizes and use established measurements for assessing outcomes.",

This study investigated information seeking for health and wellness-related resources by healthy, educated, young adults and their health and wellness perceptions and behaviors. Five focus groups were conducted with 35 young adults to gather information about diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management. The information-seeking skills and skepticism of information were high for this sample. They were more informed and practiced healthier behaviors related to nutrition and exercise than expected. However, they were less knowledgeable about good sleep hygiene and had varying sleep behaviors. The stress management techniques employed were a balance of healthy and unhealthy behaviors. This study's findings imply that it would be useful for family and consumer sciences educators and Extension professionals to add educational programming about good sleep hygiene and stress management techniques in addition to nutritional and healthy activity education.",

    "abstract": "This study explored relationships between health-related practices and performance of 10 positive personal finance practices. Data came from a 20-question online quiz that provides a simultaneous assessment of individuals' health and financial practices. The sample included 8,128 persons who completed the survey instrument from July 2015 through June 2017. All three hypotheses were supported. Specifically, three independent variables (diet index, sleep, and physical activity) showed significant positive associations with an index comprised of 10 positive financial behaviors. Results suggest that diet behavior may be more closely associated with financial behavior than the other two health behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Given the body image and disordered eating struggles prevalent in young adults, weight-inclusive anti-diet programs are needed on college campuses. Such programs replace weight loss advice with changes that center physical and mental well-being. Methods/Program Design: University health and wellness programs such as University Coaching for Activity and Nutrition (UCAN) is a novel weight-inclusive health and wellness coaching program designed to support university students and faculty/staff in their development and maintenance of self-care behaviors related to physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Specifically, we describe the program's mechanisms for participant recruitment, health coach training, session protocol, program evaluation, and supervision so other campuses can replicate the program model at their respective universities. Discussion: This work can help campuses cultivate positive self-care habits that improve physical and mental health through the lens of a weight-inclusive paradigm while also creating research and service-learning experiences for pre-health professionals.",

    "abstract": "Proper nutrition, adequate amounts of physical activity, and sufficient amounts of sleep are three important variables for healthy children. Alternative certification teachers quickly enter the classroom at the beginning of their programs and may encounter disengaged students who lack the energy needed for quality learning and achievement. Commonly, classroom management issues are the biggest challenges faced by new teachers in alternative certification programs (Evans, 2010). Children who receive proper nutrition, adequate amounts of physical activity, and sufficient amounts of sleep could be more receptive to learning and have the energy levels needed for dynamic and engaging classroom experiences. This article addresses nutrition, exercise, and sleep for students in the context of new teachers in alternative certification programs. Alternative certification teachers in the New York City Teaching Fellows program were surveyed to determine their attitude toward student health issues in the schools and it was found that teachers indicated student health issues to be important to them.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To understand the meanings of diet, physical activity, and body weight in the context of women's cancer experiences. Design: Grounded theory using 15 qualitative interviews and 3 focus groups. Setting: Grassroots community cancer organizations in the northeastern United States. Participants: Thirty-six white women cancer survivors; 86% had experienced breast cancer. Main Outcome Measures: Participants' views of the meanings of body weight, diet, and physical activity in the context of the cancer. Analysis: Procedures adapted from the constant comparative method of qualitative analysis using iterative open coding. Results: Themes emerged along 3 intersecting dimensions: vulnerability and control, stress and living well, and uncertainty and confidence. Diet and body weight were seen as sources of increased vulnerability and distress. Uncertainty about diet heightened distress and lack of control. Physical activity was seen as a way to regain control and reduce distress. Conclusions and Implications: Emergent themes of vulnerability-control, stress-living well, and uncertainty-confidence may aid in understanding and promoting health behaviors in the growing population of cancer survivors. Messages that resonated with participants included taking ownership over one's body, physical activity as stress reduction, healthy eating for overall health and quality of life, and a second chance to get it right.

    "abstract": "College students' mental health can be compromised by the exceeding demands of academia and other life stressors that can aversively impact their mood, sleep quality, and academic performance (Jordan et al., 2020; Silisteanu et al., 2022). Moreover, chronic exposure to high stress can increase risk of developing mental illness and other long-term health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer; highlighting the connection between psychological and physiological health (Bharwani et al., 2015; C. H. Liu et al., 2019; Ohrnberger et al., 2017). The relation between the brain's central nervous system and the gut's enteric nervous system may be better explained by the underlying mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, which can be directly and indirectly influenced by several lifestyle factors, including diet (Berding, Ahmed, et al., 2020; Clapp et al., 2017, Skonieczna-Zydecka et al., 2018). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of diet and lifestyle factors related to gut health on mental health among college students by employing a repeated measures design to assess diet composition and aspects of perceived stress across time. Results revealed a statistically significant three-way interaction between diet, stress, and sleep quality (p = &lt; 0.001), with increased psychological stress associated with poorer diet and sleep quality. Additionally, an exploratory analysis was conducted to examine aspects of nutrition that have been shown to be associated with promoting gut health and brain function (Ayakdas &amp; Agagunduz, 2023). The impact of consuming fiber rich diets comprised of microbiota accessible carbohydrates and other nutrients that influence psychobiotics are discussed to better understand the role of diet as a mediating factor between gut and brain health.

    "abstract": "Poor academic performance has been linked with particular lifestyle behaviors, such as unhealthy diet, short sleep duration, high screen time, and low physical activity. However, little is known about how lifestyle behavior patterns (or combinations of behaviors) contribute to children's academic performance. We aimed to compare academic performance across clusters of children with common lifestyle behavior patterns. We clustered participants (Australian children aged 9-11 years, n = 284) into four mutually exclusive groups of distinct lifestyle behavior patterns, using the following lifestyle behaviors as cluster inputs: light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity; sedentary behavior and sleep, derived from 24-hour accelerometry; self-reported screen time and diet. Differences in academic performance (measured by a nationally administered standardized test) were detected across the clusters, with scores being lowest in the &quot;Junk Food Screenies&quot; cluster (unhealthy diet/high screen time) and highest in the &quot;Sitters&quot; cluster (high nonscreen sedentary behavior/low physical activity). These findings suggest that reduction in screen time and an improved diet may contribute positively to academic performance. While children with high nonscreen sedentary time performed better academically in this study, they also accumulated low levels of physical activity. This warrants further investigation, given the known physical and mental benefits of physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Background: Individuals with cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS) report both lower physical activity levels and more insomnia than the general population. However, reliable data on adults with CDS are missing so far. The aims of the present study were three-fold: (1) to investigate the associations between CDS and physical activity patterns among young adults, and more specifically dimensions of physical activity (walking time/week, bicycling time/week, and aerobic physical activity/week), (2) to explore, if CDS scores, physical activity patterns, and insomnia were interrelated, and (3) to explore, if physical activity was directly or indirectly associated with CDS via decreased insomnia. Method: A total of 246 young adult students (M[subscript age] = 22.62; 56.3% females) participated in the present cross-sectional study. They completed a booklet of questionnaires covering socio-demographic information, cognitive disengagement syndrome (Adult Concentration Inventory; ACI), physical activity patterns (International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ), and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index; ISI). Results: Higher scores for the ACI as a proxy of CDS were associated with lower physical activity patterns (durations of walking, bicycling, and aerobic exercising per week), and with higher scores for insomnia. Conditional effects modelings showed that while there was no direct and indirect association of physical activity on CDS scores, both a direct and indirect association of insomnia via lower physical activity on higher CDS scores was observed. Conclusions: Among a smaller sample of young adults, higher CDS scores were associated with lower physical activity patterns and with more insomnia. Given that standardized behavioral intervention programs are available to improve both daily and weekly physical activity patterns and insomnia, such interventions might also favorably improve CDS.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To determine whether improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), blood pressure (BP) and body composition previously seen after a 16-week exercise intervention (POST) with hypocaloric diet are maintained following six months (6M) of unsupervised exercise time. Methods: Overweight/obese, physically inactive participants with primary hypertension (HTN) (n = 190) were randomly assigned into an attention control group (physical activity recommendations) or one of three supervised exercise groups. After POST, all participants received diet and physical activity advice for the following 6M but no supervision. All anthropometric and physiological measurements were taken pre and post the 16-week supervised intervention period, as well as after 6M of no supervision. Results: After 6M: 1) body mass (BM) ([delta] = 2.5%) and waist circumference ([delta] = 1.8%) were higher (P &lt; 0.005) than POST, but lower (P &lt; 0.005) than pre-intervention (BM, [delta] = -5.1%; waist circumference, [delta] = -4.7%), with high-volume and high-intensity interval training group revealing a higher BM reduction ([delta] = -6.4 kg) compared to control group ([delta] = -3.5 kg); 2) BP variables were higher (P &lt; 0.001) compared to POST with no change from pre-intervention; and 3) CRF was higher compared to pre-intervention ([delta] = 17.1%, P &lt; 0.001) but lower than POST ([delta] = -5.7%, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: When an overweight/obese population with HTN attains significant improvements in cardiometabolic health POST intervention with diet restriction, there is a significant reduction following 6M when exercise and diet supervision is removed, and only recommendations were applied. These results suggest the need for a regular, systematic and supervised diet and exercise programs to avoid subsequent declines in cardiometabolic health.",

Design: Retrospective study incorporating quantitative (a self-completed survey) and qualitative (one-on-one interviews) methods. Methodology: Participants were women aged 18 or over; had no pre-existing medical condition that might be exacerbated during pregnancy (e.g. diabetes, heart condition); and had given birth in the last 12 months. Nineteen women agreed to one-on-one interviews and 100 women agreed to complete a mailed questionnaire. Qualitative data and quantitative data were analysed using a descriptive qualitative methodology and by using McNemar's test for correlated proportions, respectively. Results: Participants reported a significant reduction in their level of physical activity during pregnancy; a significant increase in consumption of fruit, vegetables and fibre, and a decrease in fast food consumption (all &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.05). Medical practitioners are the preferred source of health information but seem to provide insufficient information about health behaviours during pregnancy in relation to physical activity, diet and weight management. Conclusion: Women reported eating a healthier diet and reducing their level of physical activity during the antenatal period, compared to pre-pregnancy. There is a need to improve the provision of health information on physical activity, diet and weight management in the antenatal period.",

This study investigated the patterns of lifestyle behaviors among cancer survivors and differences in HRQOL between behavioral classes. Cancer survivors (n = 2,463) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Participants (N= 591) were predominately female (63%) and non-Hispanic White (90%). Survey items included self-reported physical activity, diet, smoking, sleep, HRQOL, and demographics. Behavioral classes were estimated by latent class analysis. Differences between classes were assessed by latent class regression. Compared with the &quot;healthy lifestyles&quot; class (higher probabilities of meeting aerobic/strength-based activity guidelines, high fruit/vegetable intake, and no sleep problems; 11% of sample), the &quot;sleep and diet problems with inconsistent physical activity&quot; class (higher probabilities of not meeting strength-based guidelines, low fruit/vegetable intake, some sleep problems; marginally higher probability of meeting aerobic guidelines; 41%) had poorer general and physical HRQOL. The &quot;poor physical activity and diet&quot; class (higher probabilities of not meeting aerobic/strength-based guidelines, low fruit/vegetable intake, and some sleep problems; 48%) had poorer general, physical, and mental HRQOL. Few participants exhibited healthy lifestyle patterns associated with HRQOL. The findings provide opportunities to develop differentiated multiple behavior-change interventions, targeted to two common patterns of behavior. A large subgroup of cancer survivors was susceptible to suboptimal physical activity and diet, warranting interventions exclusively targeting these behaviors. Another subgroup was susceptible to suboptimal physical activity, diet, and sleep, indicating interventions for this group should include strategies targeting these three behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Although research establishes that student characteristics exert considerable influence on learning outcomes, research concerned with e-learning satisfaction most typically focuses of factors associated with instructional design, curriculum and pedagogy. Fifty-eight first-year university e-students completed an online survey that queried their satisfaction with various e-learning experiences and their physical characteristics (i.e., activity level, perception of health, level of pain, sleep and fatigue, diet and nutrition and problematic use of alcohol) and psychological characteristics (i.e., self-efficacy, stress, obsessive-compulsive behaviours, self-esteem, loneliness, peer relations, social adjustment and social support). Stepwise regression analysis was conducted in order to determine which physical and psychological variables predicted student satisfaction with e-learning. Student social adjustment to university, perception of family support, problematic use of alcohol and obsessive-compulsive tendencies, in various combinations, explained as much as one-third of the variance in student e-learning satisfaction. As e-learning continues to evolve, student physical and psychological well-being may assume increased focus in virtual instructional contexts as students are supported in a variety of ways. E-students with, for example, problems with alcohol may be identified and directed to online sources of support. E-learning practice may have sufficiently matured to consider the many ways in which virtual connection can promote both learning and wellness or, preferably, that learning and well-being are not conceptualized as distinct phenomena.",

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of insomnia in first-year college students, and explored the correlation between insomnia and trait anxiety. Data revealed a significant prevalence of insomnia in our sample (N = 100). There was also a strong correlation between trait anxiety and insomnia, in addition to a strong correlation between sleep-onset latency (e.g., pre-sleep experience) and sleep quality (e.g., post-sleep experience).

The purpose of this study was to examine the nutrition and PA outcomes of FitU participants. Design: Pre-experimental single group repeated-measures field study design with qualitative programme evaluation feedback at post-test. Setting: FitU participants met with both a nutrition and PA peer mentor four times each for a total of eight sessions. Method: Participants (N = 125) completed pre- and post-surveys about their nutrition and PA attitudes and behaviours. Results: FitU participants increased their eating competence from pre-to-post assessment and decreased their perceived barriers to healthy eating. Participants also increased their readiness to exercise and reported being more physically active. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a peer-led, non-diet mentoring intervention in promoting health-supporting habits among college students.",

    "abstract": "Chronic insomnia can lead to depression, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, workplace absenteeism, underperformance, and high employee turnover as well as medical issues such as Alzheimer's, hypertension, myocardial infarction, obesity, and diabetes. Researchers have argued that healthful sleep is the most important factor in predicting longevity over diet, exercise, and heredity. Previous studies consider insomnia but do not address the specific issue of the levels of insomnia experienced by school principals and superintendents in Missouri. The purpose of the study was to investigate the levels in school administrators based on gender, age, ethnicity, experience in the current role, the level of professional role, the size of district and school, socioeconomic status of the district, socioeconomic status of school and type of school setting. Using the Survey Monkey online service, a two-part survey was e-mailed to 2,936 principals and superintendents listed in the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education School Directory (Missouri, 2016). The survey was comprised with a measurement to obtain the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and a demographic questionnaire. The survey response rate was 28.3% (n = 874). The findings show that insomnia scores differed between genders with female principals having significantly higher insomnia scores compared to male principals. Insomnia scores also differed across age groups, revealing that principals between 41 and 50 years of age had significantly higher insomnia scores than principals 51 years and older. In addition, insomnia scores differed across school settings, which revealed that principals managing urban schools had significantly higher insomnia scores than those managing rural schools. Insomnia scores did not differ significantly across any of the factors concerning superintendents nor in comparisons between principals and superintendents.

    "abstract": "Although sleep is a necessary function, it is not always prioritized, especially among university students. Sleep deprivation can be detrimental to university students due to an impact on memory, focus, emotional regulation, and stress levels. There is a bi-directional relationship between sleep quality and stress levels. The vast majority,?if not all research studies involving sleep quality and stress interventions focuses?on the direct impact stress reduction techniques have on sleep quantity. The researcher's main objective in conducting this study was to?identify?if undergraduate university participants exposed to a behavioral sleep education intervention that focused on teaching sleep hygiene techniques to improve sleep quality would have significantly less perceived stress compared with participants exposed to an active control. This topic was also explored to clarify some of the recent ambiguous literature regarding the bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and stress. The researcher's secondary objective in conducting this study was to increase awareness regarding the importance of sleep among university students and equip participants with sleep hygiene techniques to form more productive sleep habits. The general population targeted in this study were undergraduate students in a large urban Midwestern university. The intervention was facilitated virtually using Qualtrics, which randomly assigned participants to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received a behavioral sleep education intervention and were randomly assigned three out of the six sleep hygiene modules: bedtime routine, exercise, nutrition, sleep environment, bedtime relaxation, and sleep schedule. Goal setting was included in each module to further encourage behavior change based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The control group also received three modules with a similar structure as the intervention group. In contrast, the active control did not encourage any behavior change or mention the benefits of sleep. Instead, the modulus focused on sleep facts including the history of sleep, the sleep cycle, and dreams. At baseline and post-intervention, both groups completed measures quantify the dependent variables: perceived stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item; sleep hygiene was measured by the Sleep Hygiene Index, and sleep quality was measured by the Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8b. Results demonstrated that participants in the behavioral sleep education intervention had lower perceived stress, more productive sleep hygiene behavior, and better sleep quality post-intervention compared with participants in the control group.

Purpose: To conduct a needs assessment with HS staff to: 1) understand perceptions, barriers and motivators to healthful behaviors; and 2) ascertain interest in a worksite wellness program. Methods: Surveys (n = 154) and telephone interviews (n = 25) were conducted with HS staff from eight Colorado HS centers (4 rural, 4 urban). Results: Findings indicate that 56% of teachers were overweight or obese, 89% wanted to be more active, and 86.6% desired wellness programming. Motivators consisted of relief of stress, health, and weight control; barriers included time, fatigue, and money; desired topics included nutrition, exercise, and stress management. Motivators, barriers and interest topics were consistent across surveys and interviews. Discussion and Translation to Health Education Practice: HS staff want and need comprehensive wellness programming. Wellness programming should be tailored to include nutrition, physical activity and stress reduction strategies utilizing multifaceted modes of delivery. Improved staff wellness and increased comfort with health and wellness topics could impact the school environment and young children's health.",

Participants: Three hundred fifty seven undergraduate students enrolled in U.S. colleges. Methods: Students completed an online survey. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine whether SSQ moderated the relationship between mindfulness and nutrition behavior. Results: SSQ moderated the relationship between mindfulness and nutrition behavior. The observe facet of mindfulness was the most predictive of nutrition behavior, whereas the observe and describe facets were the most predictive of exercise behavior.

The current study examined this association, including potential mediators (i.e., sleep disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and depression), in a sample of Veterans. SEM analyses revealed that exercise was directly and indirectly associated with suicide risk. Additionally, exercise was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and better sleep patterns, each of which was, in turn, related to lower suicide risk. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

Participants: Three hundred and twenty ethnically diverse undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: MSB-Nutrition program, an on-campus weight management course, and a comparison group. Methods: Students completed baseline and follow-up surveys regarding their nutrition and physical activity behaviors, self-efficacy, stress, attitudes, and body weight. Results: Compared with the on-campus course and a comparison group, the MSB-Nutrition program increased fruit and vegetable consumption, reduced stress, and increased fruit and vegetable self-efficacy but had no significant effect on students' exercise self-efficacy, exercise behavior, or weight loss. Conclusions: The MSB-Nutrition program was effective in changing students' nutrition behaviors but had no effect on physical activity behaviors or weight loss. Suggestions for improving Internet-based interventions aimed at decreasing obesity rates among college students are offered. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

    "abstract": "For undergraduate students, excessive screen time is associated with poorer mental health and greater perceived stress. Objective: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the potential moderating influence of physical activity and sleep on the relationship between screen time and stress. Participants &amp; Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 513 undergraduate students between Fall 2017 &amp; Spring 2020 were given a questionnaire to assess perceived stress level, physical activity engagement, screen time, and sleep. Results: Stepwise hierarchical regression analyses identified that screen time, sleep, and the three-way interaction between screen time, sleep, and physical activity were associated with stress. Post-hoc decomposition revealed that higher levels of physical activity and sleep both mitigated the relationship between screen time and stress. Conclusions: Findings suggest that modifiable health behaviors such as physical activity and sleep may be important factors for managing the negative effects of screen time on stress in college-aged adults.",

    "abstract": "Many community-based lifestyle interventions targeting African Americans have reported positive effects on participants' dietary choices and physical activity habits. However, these effects vary and not all participants will have outcome changes. Moderation analysis can help explain differential effects observed, but are not often reported. Hence, the objective of this secondary analysis was to explore potential moderators of intervention dose effects on diet quality and physical activity outcomes in an effective lifestyle intervention. Delta Body and Soul III, conducted from 2011 to 2012, was a 6-month, church-based, multicomponent, educational intervention designed to improve diet quality and increase physical activity in rural Southern African American adults. Generalized linear mixed models were used to determine associations among indicators of intervention dose received by participants, potential moderators and health outcome changes. Results indicated only three baseline characteristics--employment status, food shopping frequency and individual with primary responsibility for meal preparation--moderated the effects of education session attendance on diet quality changes. No evidence for moderation of exercise class attendance effects on physical activity changes was found. Thus, this culturally targeted, multicomponent lifestyle intervention did induce positive health changes in participants with a range of sociodemographic characteristics and food shopping and eating behaviors.",

Research shows that prevention at an early age is more effective than treatment later in life. Energize is a multicomponent intervention incorporated into the school day that combines nutrition education and physical activity aimed at maintaining healthy weight among elementary school youth. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Energize program for changing dietary and physical activity habits compared to a control group of children not participating in the program. Methods: A total of 104, 3rd and 4th graders in 3 southern Indiana elementary schools took part in the study. A quasi-experimental design was used to assess dietary and exercise habits of students in Energize and control groups through 12-week diet/activity logs and post-test questionnaires after controlling for the pre-test results. Results: Energize reduced consumption of French fries and potato chips, but did not increase physical activity. Conclusions: This study provides future researchers with a foundation for preparing longer studies of Energize or to compare multiple years of a standardized Energize curriculum.",

Results: A small proportion of students (24.5%) engaged in the recommended 150+ minutes of physical activity per week and 7.9% consumed 5+ servings of fruit/vegetables daily. Half (49.6%) slept 7 hours or less per night. Biometric screenings found that 26.4% of the students had high stress, 31.9% were overweight or obese, and 17.3% had prehypertension or hypertension. Less sleep was significantly associated with higher risks of being stressed, being overweight/obese, and having elevated blood pressure.

The COVID-19 pandemic heightened this experience. Healthful diets and sleep patterns are associated with improved physical and mental well-being. Purpose: The goal of this study was to identify if there was a relationship between changes in sleep and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A group of college students was surveyed online using Qualtrics software during the first two months of lockdown restrictions at a large, midwestern university in the United States. Results: More participants reported no changes in diet and increased hours of sleep than reported declines or improvements in diet, or reductions or retained sleep patterns. Participants who maintained their diet were likely to maintain their current sleep pattern. Conclusion: College students demonstrated resilience in healthful behaviors during the first two months of COVID-19 lockdown.",

Three groups were selected for the study: control, single treatment and social treatment under nutrition treatment, too. The groups that were under nutrition treatments should have information about the nutrition resources. This experiment was done for two years, 2013-2014. Results showed that sport has significant effect at 5% probability level on weight loss. Also, sport has significant effect at 5% probability level on illness percent decreasing, and decreasing of illness percent under single sport treatment was more than other treatments. The results showed that by increasing the cortisol reactivity ratio, the cortisol concentration at the end measurement decreased.

Although previous research has shown the positive effects of parent-based sleep intervention, it was mainly focused on face-to-face modality, which might limit accessibility. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a telehealth-delivered parent-based sleep-focused intervention in treating insomnia in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder. A total of 62 parents/caregivers with a child with autism spectrum disorder and comorbid insomnia (aged 3-6 years) were randomized to receive either three weekly group sessions of sleep-focused intervention via Zoom with telephone support (n = 30) or treatment as usual (n = 32). The intervention group had significantly greater improvements in overall sleep problems (Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire total score; p &lt; 0.05), bedtime resistance (p &lt; 0.05), and sleep-onset delay (p &lt; 0.05) at post-treatment as compared to the treatment as usual group.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Outcome variables included emotional eating (EE), uncontrolled eating (UE), and cognitive restraint (CR) as measured by The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised. Bivariate analyses, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression were completed with significance at p[less than or equal to]0.05. Results: Higher EE was associated with higher stress levels and female sex (p &lt;0.001 and p=0.02) and higher UE scores were associated with higher perceived stress (p&lt;0.001) while lower UE scores were associated with tobacco use (p=0.03 regression, p=0.098, bivariate). Higher CR was associated with higher parental education and use of relaxation methods. Higher CR also was associated with perceived stress, but this relationship differed depending upon freshmen status and amount of physical activity, and a relationship with sleep was observed that differed depending upon freshmen status. Conclusion: Interventions to help college students reduce stress and improve sleep may improve eating behaviors.",

Fasting blood samples were assayed for glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Results: Insomnia was positively associated with stress of life events ([beta] = 0.28, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety ([beta] = 0.46, p &lt; 0.001). Insomnia was related to elevated fasting insulin ([beta] = 0.12, p = 0.04) and triglyceride level ([beta] = 1.85, p &lt; 0.001). An inverse association was found between insomnia and HDL-cholesterol ([beta] = -0.45, p = 0.03). Sobel's test for mediation showed that stress of life events (p = 0.020) and anxiety (p = 0.013) mediated the relationship between insomnia and hypertriglyceridemia.

Social support moderated the association between stress and sitting time on weekdays. Conclusions: Stress reduction and fostering social support may be important strategies for promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors in college students. Additional strategies are needed to buffer the deleterious effects of stress.",

    "abstract": "Healthy diet and physical activity (PA) prevent and reduce chronic disease. Social cognitive theory delineates multiple attitudes and barriers that influence these behaviors. Understanding covariation in these attitudes and barriers is complex. We examined whether individuals could be grouped into a small number of categories that are easier to study. Interviews were conducted with 982 adults from two low-income, predominantly African American neighborhoods in the same city. Social cognitive constructs, including self-efficacy, social norms, and internal and external barriers to diet and exercise, and walking were self-reported. We measured moderate to vigorous physical activity with accelerometers and diet with 24-hour recalls. We conducted a latent profile analysis of attitudes and barriers to diet and PA and identified four classes: (a) &quot;moderate diet and negative exercise attitudes,&quot; where participants were roughly average on dietary attitudes but reported exercise-related challenges, including lower social support, outcome expectancies, physical functioning, and self-efficacy; (b) &quot;few barriers and benefits of healthy diet and exercise,&quot; where participants reported fewer barriers and lower outcome expectancies for diet and PA; (c) &quot;moderate overall attitudes,&quot; where participants had average scores on most indicators but below-average exercise self-efficacy and slightly more exercise barriers; and (d) &quot;positive overall attitudes,&quot; characterized by more positive attitudes toward both diet and PA across most domains, particularly regarding self-efficacy to overcome exercise barriers. These profiles could inform efforts to tailor individual-level interventions for diet and PA of persons at high risk of chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Insufficient sleep is a serious public health problem in college students. Exercise is a widely prescribed behavioral treatment for sleep and mood issues; however, more focused and gender-specific prescriptions are needed. The present study examined relationships between exercise, sleep, and mood in undergraduate men and women. Students (N = 866, 19.6 ± 1.4 years, 38.7% women) were recruited from campus recreation facilities and completed demographic, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, mood (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), and exercise questionnaires. The Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines were used to dichotomize those who did and did not meet weekly aerobic and strength training exercise recommendations. In men, greater exercise frequency associated with less daytime dysfunction ([beta] = 0.147) and less depressive mood ([beta] = -0.64, ps &lt; 0.05). In women, greater exercise frequency associated with earlier bedtime ([beta] = -12.6), improved sleep quality ([beta] = 0.17), increased positive affect ([beta] = 0.91), less depressive mood ([beta] = -0.71), and less anger ([beta] = -1.24, ps &lt; 0.05). Compared to men, women reported earlier bedtime, poorer sleep efficiency, and more anxiety and depressive mood (ps &lt; 0.05, n[subscript p][superscript 2] range: 0.01-0.04). Compared to individuals who met physical activity guidelines, those who did not meet the guidelines reported later bedtimes, less positive affect, more anxiety, and more anger (ps &lt; 0.05 n[subscript p][superscript 2]s = 0.01). Among men, those who met physical activity guidelines reported falling asleep more quickly than those who did not meet guidelines (n[subscript p][superscript 2] = 0.01, p = 0.007); however, no relationship between guideline adherence and sleep latency was observed in women. Adhering to physical activity guidelines may be important for optimal sleep and emotional health. Clinicians should consider gender when creating exercise prescriptions for sleep issues.",

Given the importance of LsHs for these young adults' physical and mental health and academic success, it is pertinent to examine whether these changes were maintained beyond the public health crisis. As post-pandemic data on the LsHs of post-secondary students in Canada remain limited, the aim of this study is to provide an overview. In October 2023, data on six LsHs (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet, sleep, screen time, drug and alcohol use) were collected from 2,283 students at 14 post-secondary institutions in Quebec, Canada. The resulting portrait suggests that habits relating to physical activity, sedentary behaviours and alcohol and drug consumption are healthier than before and during the pandemic. However, eating habits and screen time appear to be less healthy than before and during the pandemic. Sleep patterns, which were disrupted during the pandemic, seem to be returning to pre-pandemic levels. These results are discussed in the light of plausible explanations and suggest possible interventions to consider.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the importance of holistic health practices based on evidence from various studies ranging from stress and burnout prevention from holistic practices to administrative support in an educational setting. Through researching these studies, new questions arose as to whether a limit exists to the preventative measures that may be taken to help alleviate stress and the subsequent impact. Current resources appear unclear if there are compounding benefits that may be achieved by attempting multiple paths to correct the impact of COVID-19-induced stress and burnout. The research conducted during this study explored the causes of stress and burnout along with the many ways that stress and burnout reduction occur. The researcher then designed a survey that collected data from 68 educators on perceived stress and burnout levels, holistic health practices employed by educators, educator logging practices, and the administrative support given to educators. The survey produced significant data that indicated the employment of activity, social interaction, adequate rest, and a nutritious diet correlated the most with lower levels of stress. The researcher then suggested different ways to practically apply the findings in an educational setting, like having activity options available in schools, making nutritious eating more accessible, moderating work-life balance to ensure recovery time, and creating time to socialize. As a result, this study hopes to encourage educators to employ holistic health practices, administrators to develop cultures that promote holistic health practices, and researchers to further explore the benefits and interactions of holistic health practices specific to educators.

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The lack of effective treatment for these conditions underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Previous studies have indicated that microcirculation serves as the pathological basis for the comorbidity of hypertension and cognitive dysfunction. Our initial clinical studies have indicated that acupuncture could be a safe and effective treatment for managing hypertension and MCI. Whether acupuncture can enhance hypertension and cognitive impairment by modulating microcirculation, and the precise mechanisms involved, warrants further exploration. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of electroacupuncture on MCI of patients with hypertension and to explore whether it can improve hypertension and cognitive impairment by regulating microcirculation. In this multicenter, large-scale, single-blind, randomized controlled trial, we will recruit 252 patients with hypertension and cognitive impairment from 3 hospitals and randomly assign them to 3 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: the electroacupuncture group, the sham electroacupuncture (SEA) group, and the waiting list group. The electroacupuncture group and SEA group will receive either electroacupuncture or SEA for 12 weeks, while the waiting list group will not receive acupuncture treatment for the first 12 weeks. The primary outcome will be the changes in overall cognitive function, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The secondary outcomes include blood pressure status, subdomain cognitive function, mental status, sleep quality, hemodynamics, and microcirculation indicators. The study protocol has been approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of traditional Chinese medicine. This study was registered on April 26, 2024, with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Data collection began in May 2024 and ended in April 2025. Currently, data from this trial are in the collection phase, and no data analysis has been performed. As of January 1, 2025, we have collected data from 65 patients. The results of this trial are expected to be submitted for publication in July 2026. This clinical trial aims to compare the efficacy of electroacupuncture versus SEA or waiting list control in the treatment of hypertension with cognitive impairment and to explore its impact on microcirculation through hemodynamic and microcirculatory indices. The results of this trial will contribute to clarifying the microcirculatory mechanisms of electroacupuncture in the treatment of hypertension with cognitive impairment, providing a solid foundation for further research on electroacupuncture therapy.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease influenced by environmental, lifestyle, biological, and genetic factors, affecting over 1 billion people globally. Treatment for adults typically involves multicomponent lifestyle interventions-diet, physical activity, and behavior change-for at least 6-12 months. However, adherence is often low, and in-person sessions can be time-consuming and costly. Digital therapeutics (DTx), which enhance patient engagement and support long-term outcomes, have proven effective in managing chronic and mental health conditions. DTx offer scalable, evidence-based solutions with the potential to improve obesity management. The Digital Therapy to Promote Weight Loss in Patients With Obesity by Increasing Their Adherence to Treatment (DEMETRA) study is a prospective, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, double-arm, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the 6-month efficacy of an innovative, multicomponent digital intervention for obesity, which combines dietary, physical activity, and behavioral strategies in people with obesity (primary objective). Secondary objectives were assessing changes in BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, adherence, and factors associated with absolute 6-month weight loss. The trial was conducted at 2 obesity centers in Italy with 246 participants aged 18-65 years (BMI 30-45 kg/m2), randomly assigned to either the Digital Therapeutics for Obesity (DTxO) app or a placebo app. DTxO offered personalized diet plans, exercise routines, and psycho-behavioral support, while the placebo app only allowed users to log data without feedback. Both groups followed a Mediterranean-style low-calorie diet with an 800 kcal/day deficit. On average, participants used the DTxO app for 42 minutes/day and the placebo app for 35 minutes, primarily for physical activity tracking. Univariable and multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess associations with 6-month absolute weight change (primary end point) and percent weight change (secondary end point). Overall, 207 participants (84.1%) completed the 6-month visit. Both arms achieved a statistically significant absolute (DtxO: -3.2 kg, IQR -6.0 kg to -0.9 kg; placebo: -4.0 kg, IQR -6.9 kg to -0.5 kg; P&lt;.001) and percent loss in body weight (DtxO: -3.0%, IQR -5.7% to -0.8%; placebo: -4.0%, IQR -8.5% to -0.5%; P&lt;.001) after 6 months, without significant between-group differences (univariable generalized linear models: P=.34 and P=.17, respectively). Univariable regression analyses showed a significant association between adherence to app use and 6-month absolute weight loss (&#x3b2;=-.06, SE 0.02, P=.01) as well as percent weight loss (&#x3b2;=-.05, SE 0.01, P=.01). Adherent participants, defined as those with overall adherence at or above the 75th percentile of daily usage, included 35 individuals in the intervention group and 10 in the placebo group. In this subgroup, the estimated 6-month mean absolute weight change was -7.02 kg (95% CI -9.45 to -4.59) in the DTxO-adherent group and -3.50 kg (95% CI -7.01 to 0.01) in the placebo-adherent group (P=.02). The estimated 6-month mean percent change in weight was -6.31% (95% CI -8.86 to -3.76) in the DTxO-adherent group and -2.78% (95% CI -6.48 to 0.92) in the placebo-adherent group (P=.03). A significantly greater weight loss (P=.01 for study arm, either on absolute or percent change in weight from baseline) among adherent participants randomized to the DTxO app was also confirmed by analyses using mixed linear models for repeated measures. Although overall weight loss did not differ significantly between the DTxO and placebo groups, participants who used the DTxO app for at least 40% of the expected time achieved significantly greater weight loss. These results suggest that higher engagement with DTx can improve obesity outcomes. Further research should explore combining DTxO with pharmacological treatments or bariatric surgery.

This study aims to identify the current perception and implementation efforts of arthroplasty surgeons in the nation regarding nutritional, functional status, and bone health optimization. A 28-question survey was anonymously distributed to orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeons through the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeon contact database. Survey responses were compiled and analyzed with chi square. Sixty-four total arthroplasty surgeons completed the questionnaire with the following geographic distribution: 33% Midwest, 27% Northeast, 23% Southeast, and 16% West. Forty-six percentage of survey participants reported a formal departmental nutrition optimization protocol despite 14% of surgeons doubting the benefits of nutritional optimization. The perceived goals of nutrition intervention were predominantly decreasing complications rates and weight loss. Seventy-five percentage of surveyed respondents report an absence of functional status optimization protocol in place with 38% of surgeons' initial functional assessment begins with patient ambulation dependency. In addition, 13% of surgeon routinely assess bone health with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan for suspicion of osteoporosis, and 87% of surgeons would not delay surgery for bone health optimization. Despite data suggesting the benefits of perioperative nutritional, functional status, and bone health optimization, many barriers to implementation exist. Predominant barriers include compliance rate and logistical challenges of implementation. Comprehension of current perceptions and common practice can provide information to direct future optimization protocol development.",

    "abstract": "Promoting healthy behaviors including adequate sleep, regular physical activity, balanced diet, and abstinence from substance use, alongside nurturing affective functioning, may crucially support physical and mental well-being in youth. Yet, little is known about how these domains interact dynamically in their daily lives. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of prolonged, multiwave ambulatory assessment in school-recruited adolescents as well as in clinical and school-recruited preadolescents. In addition, it will examine the dynamic interplay of different health behavior domains and affective functioning in adolescent samples recruited in schools. The initial target sample size was 100 youths (ages 9-17 years) across 2 assessment protocols. Adolescents complete three 3-week waves with 4 daily ecological momentary assessments and parallel actigraphy, and preadolescents follow two 10-day assessment waves. Feasibility aims will be assessed via equivalence tests targeting an a priori level of missing data and dropout at 70% each. Dynamic modeling in adolescent datasets will be addressed by a planned multilevel analysis leveraging idiographic effects as predictors of symptom outcomes, as well as state-of-the-art exploratory frameworks. By July 2025, we enrolled 113 school adolescents and 27 school preadolescents exceeding the a priori target. Recruitment and data collection are still ongoing in the clinical preadolescent group of currently 13 preadolescents. This concise, intensive longitudinal protocol provides the basis for examining the feasibility of long-term intensive longitudinal paradigms in youth and lays a critical foundation for future large-scale studies aimed at unpacking the evolving interplay of health behaviors and emotional well-being.",

    "abstract": "Chronic mountain sickness (CMS), first described by Carlos Monge Medrano in 1925, is characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (EE), hypoxemia, and neurocognitive disturbances in long-term high-altitude residents. This narrative review revisits Monge's contribution in the light of modern research. CMS is now recognized worldwide, where genetic predisposition and environmental stressors jointly shape susceptibility to high-altitude life. Although hypoxia-driven erythropoietin (EPO) stimulation has long been considered the primary mechanism, recent evidence highlights the critical role of sex hormones in modulating erythropoiesis. EE, once the defining feature, is now complemented by symptom-based scoring systems that better capture the syndrome. Testosterone promotes erythroid expansion by stimulating progenitors, enhancing EPO sensitivity, and suppressing hepcidin, whereas estrogens counteract these effects by downregulating GATA1 and modulating hypoxia-inducible pathways. Elevated testosterone or high testosterone-to-estradiol ratios correlate with hemoglobin, hematocrit, and EE in CMS, explaining its greater prevalence and severity in men. Advances in molecular biology have identified the hypoxia-testosterone-EPO axis, with regulators such as SENP1 and GATA1, as central to disease susceptibility. Excessive androgenic signaling also worsens sleep-disordered breathing and cognitive dysfunction, while estrogenic modulation appears protective, opening avenues for prevention and therapy. In conclusion, CMS should be regarded as a multifactorial disorder shaped by hypoxia, hormones, gene-environment interactions, and cellular stress. Despite progress, underdiagnosis and limited healthcare attention in South American highlands remain major challenges, underscoring the relevance of Monge's seminal description.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the preoperative nutritional status of patients admitted to the vascular surgery clinic using the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) and further explore related risk factors, to provide a basis for clinical nutritional management.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included inpatients admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery of the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from October 2021 to March 2022. We retrospectively collected preoperative clinical data of these patients and applied the GLIM criteria to analyze their risk of malnutrition. A total of 113 vascular surgery patients were included, with a mean age of 68.76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.77 years. Among these, 31 inpatients were classified into the malnourished group, while 82 were in the well-nourished group.ResultsCompared with the well-nourished group, inpatients in the malnourished group were characterized by an older age, lower body mass index, and a higher incidence of cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, they exhibited lower hemoglobin and albumin levels, reduced pre-albumin, and a greater prevalence of arteriosclerosis obliterans in the lower limbs or gangrene. Multivariable analysis showed that age&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;70 years (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.57, 95% CI: 1.34-15.64, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015), gangrene (OR = 6.55, 95% CI: 2.14-20.07, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), and cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 6.04, 95% CI: 2.01-18.14, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) were independently associated with malnutrition.ConclusionsThe risk of malnutrition in patients admitted to the vascular surgery clinic was relatively high. Special attention should be given to inpatients over 70 years old, with gangrene or cerebrovascular diseases. This study highlights the importance of routine nutritional screening and assessment using the GLIM criteria in this high-risk population. Early identification and targeted nutritional intervention for high-risk patients are recommended to improve surgical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relationship between inflammatory/nutritional indexes and 18-month mortality in cirrhotic patients undergoing the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, and to develop a predictive nomogram. Lasso and stepwise multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to identify prognostic determinants and construct a visual prognostic nomogram. Clinical data from 2017 to 2022 were utilized for model development, while data from 2023 were for validation. The performance of nomogram was assessed using the concordance index (C-index), the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, DeLong test, decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) indexes, Kaplan-Meier curves, and the integrated Brier scores. We retrospectively included 249 patients for the development of nomogram and 66 for validation. Inflammatory indexes (systemic immune-inflammation index [SII], neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR], lymphocyte-to-white blood cell ratio [LWR], neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio [NPAR], prognostic nutritional index [PNI]) were significantly correlated with mortality. Nomogram 1 incorporated the Child-Pugh score and SII, whereas Nomogram 2 included age, Child-Pugh, and SII. The C-index value for 18-month mortality were 0.79 and 0.82 for Nomogram 1 and Nomogram 2 respectively. The AUC for 6-, 12- and 18-month were 0.759, 0.829, 0.806 in Nomogram 1 and 0.782, 0.834 and 0.834 in Nomogram 2. Nomogram 2 was regarded as the final model for superior predictive performance. Calibration and DCA curves demonstrated its consistency and clinical utility. DeLong analysis confirmed statistical superiority of Nomogram 2 over Child-Pugh score alone. NRI and IDI analyses further supported the added prognostic value of SII. High-risk patients stratified by Nomogram 2 showed significantly reduced survival (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). We identified systemic inflammatory indexes as significant prognostic biomarkers for disease-specific mortality post-TIPS.

    "abstract": "Social media (SM) platforms have become increasingly prevalent in adolescents' lives, and concerns have arisen regarding their potential contribution to depression. This study examined whether excessive SM use contributes to rising adolescent depression rates and evaluated potential mitigation strategies. We developed an individual-based microsimulation model of 18.6 million French adolescents born 1990-2012, tracking depression outcomes from 2000-2022 (analyses conducted August 2024-July 2025). The model incorporated 95 parameters, including demographics, SM use patterns, and established depression risk factors (childhood adversities, chronic physical conditions, physical inactivity, obesity, substance use). The main outcome was cumulative depression cases, and secondary outcomes were suicide deaths, health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) loss, and associated costs. The model was well-calibrated and validated adequately against US-specific data. It showed that excessive SM use likely played an important role in the recent increase in rates of adolescent depression. Among French adolescents, simulations indicated that excessive SM use was associated with an additional cumulative lifetime 590,000 depression cases (95%CI [400,000, 760,000]), 799 suicide deaths (95%CI [547, 1,028]), 137,000 (95%CI [94,000, 176,000]) HALE loss years, and 3.94 (95%CI [2.70, 5.07]) billion euros, compared to scenarios without SM platforms. Key limitations are that microsimulation modeling cannot establish causality from observational data and the reliance on duration-based exposure measures without capturing content type or engagement quality. In this study, we estimated that limiting SM use to 1&#x2009;h per day for all adolescents, replacing 30&#x2009;min of SM use with 30&#x2009;min of physical activity, or stopping its use for adolescents most at-risk for depression, would be associated with a reduction in cumulative lifetime prevalence of depression by 14.7%, 12.9%, and 12.0%, respectively, and diminished associated costs. Targeted SM interventions could potentially reduce adolescent depression burden, though real-world implementation and effectiveness require validation.",

    "abstract": "Human skin, and its associated microbiome, is a delicate ecosystem that faces daily challenges from various external factors such as ultraviolet exposure, pollutants, hygiene habits and cosmetics use. The microbiome can also be affected by internal influences such as diet and stress. Hygiene practices, especially the use of soap and bodywash, play a crucial role in maintaining skin health, hygiene and balance of the microbial ecosystem. To understand the effects of daily usage of cleansing products on the skin microbiome. Here, we performed 16S rRNA gene-sequencing (V1-V2) analysis of the skin microbiome from participants' forearms to investigate the effects of regular use of a cleansing product such as a marketed high-glycerine cast melt bar (HGCB) on the skin microbiome. In an additional study, participants' legs were washed with a marketed bodywash with standard petrolatum emulsions, and two uniquely formulated isethionate-taurate-based bodywashes with submicron emulsions containing two different types of occlusives, i.e. petrolatum and plant-derived occlusives. The findings from the studies conducted across two distinct geographical locations, involving diverse ethnic populations and various body sites, demonstrate that skin microbiome diversity is preserved following the use of a properly formulated HGCB in addition to all bodywashes containing standard or submicron occlusives. However, single-sample network analysis showed that glycerine-containing cast melt bars and bodywashes containing plant-derived submicron occlusives help to increase the network properties of the skin microbiome, which are reported to be an indicator of healthy skin. Our studies demonstrate that the daily use of a HGCB for 4 weeks or daily use of a bodywash containing plant-derived submicron occlusives for 2 weeks has no significant effect on the skin microbiome diversity. The increase in microbial co-occurrence network indicates a resilience to use of such uniquely formulated cleansing products on a regular basis. Human skin, as an ecosystem, hosts a variety of microorganisms, known as the skin microbiome. It faces daily challenges from external factors such as ultraviolet radiation exposure. Other such challenges include pollutants, hygiene habits and cosmetics use. The microbiome can also be affected by internal influences such as diet, age and stress. Hygiene practices play a crucial role in maintaining healthy skin. Such practices often include the use of soap and bodywash. In this study, we performed an analysis on participants&#x2019; arms and legs to understand the effects of soaps and bodywashes. The results showed that skin microbiome diversity remained stable after use of bodywash and soap. This result was not affected by geographical location, ethnicity or body site. Our study found that use of a mild soap bar helped to increase the network properties of the skin microbiome. This was also the case for bodywash with submicron plant-based occlusives. Such increased network properties are an indicator of healthy skin. We found an increase in the microbial co-occurrence network. This suggests resilience to external factors when using cleansing products.",

    "abstract": "Chronic liver disease (CLD) poses a significant healthcare burden, with diet playing a crucial role in its management. Food insecurity, defined as limited or uncertain access to adequate food, may worsen liver disease outcomes due to reliance on nutrient-poor diets. While its association with chronic conditions is well-established, its impact on liver disease remains underexplored. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the impact of food insecurity on liver disease development, progression, and outcomes, identifying gaps and informing future research and public health strategies. Databases including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science were searched comprehensively through April 2025. Studies evaluating food insecurity and liver disease outcomes were included. Data on study design, population, definitions, and findings were extracted. Quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of 17,609 studies identified, 17 met the inclusion criteria, predominantly from the United States. Most studies focused on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Food insecurity was linked to increased odds of MASLD, advanced fibrosis, and mortality, with higher rates of hepatic steatosis, liver stiffness, and fibrosis progression in both pediatric and adult populations. Food insecurity was measured primarily using the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module, and liver outcomes via noninvasive techniques and biomarkers. Food insecurity is a potentially modifiable risk factor for liver disease progression, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. Further research should explore food assistance interventions, its impact on diet and implement screening programs in hepatology clinics to inform tailored strategies addressing this critical determinant of liver health.",

Higher PA levels were associated with significantly better scores in physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, pain, and general health (P &lt; 0.001). Sitting duration was negatively correlated with most Short Form-36 domains. No significant association was found between PA and role limitations due to emotional problems.

    "abstract": "Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome in which impaired ventricular filling and ejection of blood into circulation causes decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (50% or more) is the most common type of heart failure, and up to 1 in 10 adults will be affected in their lifetime. Clinical symptoms such as peripheral edema, dyspnea, and orthopnea, with clinical findings including jugular venous distention, third heart sound, and laterally displaced apical impulse should prompt consideration of heart failure. Laboratory values (eg, elevated N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide) can also aid in diagnosis, which can then be confirmed with specific echocardiographic findings. Once heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is diagnosed, medications should be initiated to manage comorbid symptoms and conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce hospitalizations related to heart failure and cardiovascular-related mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure, elevated natriuretic peptide levels, and an ejection fraction more than 40%; therefore, they should be considered in all patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Additionally, loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitors can be used. In patients with end-organ dysfunction or signs of refractory treatment, consultation with a heart failure specialist should be considered.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the intricate interplay between physical health and mental well-being has garnered significant attention, specifically highlighting the potential influence of adipose tissue distribution, notably visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the abdomen, on psychological states. VAT is implicated in systemic inflammation and metabolic disruptions, which are hypothesized to contribute to the onset and progression of mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD). To investigate the relationship between VAT and MDD, we analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering 2011 to 2014. We employed multivariate logistic regression analysis to ensure the robustness of our findings. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted to elucidate the complex relationships between these variables, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) plots were utilized to visualize these interactions. Furthermore, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to ascertain the directionality of the causal relationship. The weighted, multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between VAT and the risk of MDD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.635 (95% CI 1.004-2.664). Further analysis, after accounting for potential confounding factors, revealed a more pronounced association in women, with an OR of 1.903 (95% CI 1.051-3.445). Interaction analysis indicated a potential gender-specific association between VAT and MDD, suggesting that the relationship may differ by sex (P for interaction&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis supported a bidirectional causal relationship between VAT and MDD. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness and reliability of the results. This study suggests that monitoring and managing VAT could enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of MDD and provide new insights for developing more effective treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "In addition to diet quality, which influences the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), temporal eating patterns, such as meal frequency, duration, regularity, and timing, may also play an important role. Recent studies have suggest that these eating patterns can influence CRC risk; however, dietary guidelines predominantly emphasise modifying the intake of specific food items to reduce risk and promote overall health. Additionally, comprehensive studies examining the relationship between temporal eating patterns and CRC risk are lacking. This review aimed to synthesise the available evidence on how temporal eating patterns may affect CRC risk and mortality. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest, ultimately including 20 relevant articles. Higher eating frequency, particularly when involving unhealthy foods, along with skipping breakfast and increased snacking may elevate CRC risk. Furthermore, a short interval between the last meal and bedtime has been associated with an increased risk of CRC and related mortality. The findings suggest that a short interval between the last meal and bedtime may increase CRC risk, potentially through mechanisms such as circadian rhythm disruption, oxidative stress, and inflammation. In addtion, higher meal frequency, particularly when coupled with an unhealthy diet, appears to further elevate the risk. Future research should employ standardised definitions and detailed assessment of 24-hour eating patterns to better elucidate their relationship with CRC outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, the diagnosis of hypertension is based on non-invasive upper-arm cuff blood pressure (BP) measurement. Most measurements are performed seated, although evidence indicates that supine BP may provide additional information. This review summarises recent findings on the influence of body posture on BP readings and cardiovascular (CV) risk prediction across office, ambulatory, and home BP monitoring (OBPM, ABPM, HBPM), their clinical implications and future research directions. In OBPM, patients with supine-only hypertension demonstrated CV risk comparable to patients with hypertensive BP in both positions, and a higher risk than seated-only hypertensives. Supine hypertension was particularly predictive in individuals under 65 years of age. In ABPM, the strongest predictors of CV events are nocturnal hypertension and abnormal dipping patterns, particularly when patients are truly asleep, whereas supine nocturnal HBPM has been less extensively investigated. Current clinical practice remains primarily based on seated BP measurements. Recent trials have highlighted that supine OBPM may provide additional predictive power in the assessment of CV risk. These findings offer a partial explanation for the residual high predictive value of nocturnal BP values which can be derived from ABPM or specialised HBPM devices that goes beyond the correlation of breathing related sleep disorders Research should focus on homogenising supine risk data into composite risk scores combining seated and supine BP while new outcome studies should consider including supine BP measurement. Future guideline committees should consider recommending the structured clinical application of supine BP, given its demonstrated prognostic benefits.",

By examining multidimensional variables, the study seeks to inform tailored interventions designed to enhance perceived health and prevent frailty progression in frail community-dwelling older adults. A secondary data analysis was conducted utilizing the 9th wave of KLoSA. The sample comprised 447 community-dwelling older adults classified as frail. SHS served as the dependent variable. Data were analyzed using a complex samples general linear model with IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0. The mean SHS score was 2.48&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.04 on a 5-point scale. Factors significantly associated with higher SHS scores among frail older adults included physical activity at least once a week (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.040), absence of cognitive impairment (<i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), fewer chronic diseases (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.032), lower depression scores (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.033), better instrumental activities of daily living function (<i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), and higher life satisfaction (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;.036). These findings underscore the multidimensional nature of SHS, reflecting both overall health and early indicators of frailty progression and functional decline. Based on these findings, community-based interventions emphasizing physical activity, mental health management, functional rehabilitation, and life satisfaction enhancement are suggested for frail older adults. Further longitudinal research and intervention development guided by these findings are needed.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of hip fractures is also increasing rapidly with the aging population and is currently considered a major significant global health issue due to its high mortality rate. The aim of this research is to investigate the relationship between pre-fracture frailty and postoperative patient outcomes and identify factors associated with frailty in older adults operated for hip fracture. Descriptive, cross-sectional study. Patients aged 65 and older who underwent surgery for hip fracture were included. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews with patients in their rooms preoperatively and on the first postoperative day. The study was approved by the non-interventional research ethics committee of Dokuz Eylul University. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-test, One Way ANOVA, correlation, and multiple linear regression analyses. Of the 128 patients included in the study (mean age 78.45+-8.36 years), 46.1% (n=59) were prefrail, and 39.8% (n=51) were frail. Higher frailty scores were associated with female sex, chronic disease, use of multiple long-term medications, being immobile or requiring mobility assistive devices prior to the fracture, recent decrease in appetite, need for postoperative intensive care, postoperative complications, postoperative pressure injury development, and mortality within the first month of discharge (p&lt;0.05). Preoperative frailty score was positively correlated with number of chronic diseases, preoperative fear of falling, nutritional risk score, comorbidity index score, and length of hospital stay and negatively correlated with preoperative and postoperative Katz ADL score and postoperative creatinine concentration(p&lt;0.05). The mean Frailty Scale score was 2.16+-1.26; pre-fracture nutritional status (&#x3b2;=0.312, p&lt;0.001) and functional independence status (&#x3b2;=0.216, p=0.012) were significant predictors of frailty. This study showed that frailty was prevalent among older adults undergoing hip fracture surgery and had a significant impact on postoperative patient outcomes. Pre-fracture nutritional and functional status were significant factors associated with frailty. Preoperative frailty assessment of patients presenting with hip fractures, especially focusing on nutritional and functional status, may contribute to better management of treatment and care.",

    "abstract": "Transplant surgery is a physically demanding field with an irregular call schedule. Sleep deprivation and stress have been linked to decreased cognitive abilities; however, their effects on transplant recipient outcomes remain unknown. The goal of this pilot study was to compare liver transplant (LT) recipient outcomes by surgeon sleep deprivation status and stress level. Attending LT surgeons at a high-volume transplant center wore a biophysical monitor from 12/2022 to 04/2023. Surgeon sleep deprivation and stress level were prospectively measured. All LTs were reviewed up to 90 days posttransplant. Six surgeons (66.7% male, 50% &gt;5 years of practice) wore a biophysical monitor during 36 LTs. The primary surgeon experienced sleep deprivation 50.0% of the time. Calculated stress level was moderate-to-high during 94.4% of cases. Among the 36 LT performed, all baseline recipient characteristics were similar. Sleep deprived surgeons utilized higher numbers of intraoperative blood products and had higher rates of bile leak within 90 days. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, unplanned reoperation and surgeon sleep deprivation were significant predictors of bile leak. This is the first study evaluating patient outcomes based on sleep deprivation among LT surgeons using a continuous wearable biophysical monitor. Serving as a feasibility study, largely similar patient outcomes were demonstrated despite high rates of sleep deprivation and pervasive stress states for surgeons. Notably, bile leak was associated with surgeon sleep deprivation with comparable odds to reoperation. Using this technology, additional work is warranted to elucidate associations between the physiologic states of surgeons and LT outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) usually affects the macular region of the retina, while seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a complex mental disorder. However, the interaction between these two clinical conditions remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the influence of AMD on SAD and to assess the correlation of ocular pathology with lifestyle and mental health factors. This study recruited 158 AMD patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, China, between January 2020 and October 2023. Based on their affection status, the patients were divided into two groups: the SAD group (n = 58) and the non-SAD group (n = 100). Baseline characteristics, including blood pressure, hematological parameters, ocular parameters, and lifestyle factors, were compared between the two groups to evaluate the potential influence of AMD on SAD. We observed specific differences in the family history of mental illness between the non-SAD and SAD groups (p &lt; 0.001). However, the two groups' other baseline characteristics, such as blood pressure and hematological parameters, were comparable (p &gt; 0.05). Additionally, significant differences were also observed in central retinal thickness (CRT), choroidal thickness, lesion atrophy area, and macular volume between the two groups (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, intraocular pressure (IOP) did not reveal a~significant difference between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Compared with the SAD group, the non-SAD group had significantly better vision, longer exercise duration, sunlight exposure time, outdoor activity, and lower sedentary behavior (all p &lt; 0.001). The logistic regression analysis indicated that increased macular volume (odds ratio (OR) = 3.054, p = 0.008) and sedentary behavior (OR = 4.382, p &lt; 0.001) significantly increased SAD risk. Additionally, the absence of a family history of mental illness did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.375, p = 0.129), but a specific correlation was still observed. This study shows a correlation between SAD and AMD. The significant differences in ocular pathological characteristics, lifestyle factors, and mental health status between the SAD and non-SAD groups suggest the crucial role of visual function and lifestyle in regulating mood and circadian rhythm in AMD patients.",

    "abstract": "The escalating prevalence of mental health issues and sleep disturbances among Chinese adolescents has become a pressing public health concern. Despite increasing recognition of this issue, there remains a paucity of research elucidating the intricate interplay between anxiety symptoms and sleep patterns. To address this critical gap, this study employs advanced network analysis to explore the complex relationships between these two domains, offering novel insights into their interconnectedness. We conducted a large-scale, online, cross-sectional survey encompassing 48,074 adolescents. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), while sleep quality was evaluated via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Daytime sleepiness and fatigue symptoms were measured using the Chinese Adolescent Daytime Sleepiness Scale and the Fatigue Symptom Scale (FSS). Demographic data were analysed using chi-square tests, and continuous variables were examined via t-tests. To investigate symptom-level relationships, we employed network and mediation effect analysis, providing a robust methodological framework. Our findings reveal a concerning prevalence of anxiety and insomnia symptoms among adolescents, at rates of 32.1% and 39.9%, respectively. Adolescents exhibiting anxiety symptoms reported significantly higher levels of insomnia, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness. Mediation effect analysis uncovered a chain mediation pathway, whereby insomnia and fatigue symptoms sequentially mediated the relationship between anxiety and daytime sleepiness. Network analysis further identified GAD2 (uncontrollable worry) and PSQI7 (daytime function) as pivotal core symptoms, with FSS (fatigue symptoms) demonstrating the highest expected impact within the network. This study underscores the persistent severity of anxiety and sleep pattern disturbances among adolescents. These findings highlight the importance of addressing core symptoms-particularly GAD2 and PSQI7-in therapeutic interventions. The results provide a solid foundation for developing more effective, symptom-specific strategies to improve adolescent mental health and sleep quality.",

    "abstract": "Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a prevalent degenerative spinal disorder, often accompanied by impaired sleep quality and depressive symptoms, which considerably affect patients' quality of life and hinder the recovery process. This study aimed to explore the chain mediating effects of illness acceptance and family intimacy on the relationship between sleep quality and depressive symptoms in patients with LDH. The objective was to elucidate the psychosocial mechanisms influencing the psychological well-being of these patients. A total of 110 patients diagnosed with LDH between January 2022 and January 2024 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing sleep quality, illness acceptance, family intimacy and depressive symptoms, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales II (FACES II) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Associations among the measured variables were assessed through Pearson correlation analysis. Mediation effects were analysed using the PROCESS v4.2 macro in SPSS, and the significance of the mediating effects was assessed via bootstrapping. A significant positive correlation was observed between the degree of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms (r = 0.417, p &lt; 0.01). Illness acceptance and family intimacy served as key mediators in the relationship between sleep quality and depressive symptoms. Specifically, poor sleep quality was associated with increased depressive symptoms through its negative effects on family intimacy (&#x3b2; = -0.211, p = 0.027) and illness acceptance (&#x3b2; = -0.266, p = 0.003). Mediation analysis indicated that the total indirect effect accounted for 35.10% of the total effect. The chain-mediated pathway, sleep quality &#x2192; family intimacy &#x2192; illness acceptance &#x2192; depressive symptoms, had an effect size of 0.062 (Boot SE = 0.010, 95% CI: 0.005 to 0.043), indicating that this pathway was also valid. Sleep quality is significantly associated with depressive symptoms in patients with LDH. Illness acceptance and family intimacy function as key mediators in this relationship. These findings underscore the importance of psychosocial factors in the mental health of patients with LDH and provide a theoretical foundation for developing targeted psychological interventions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of electroencephalographic biofeedback (EEG-BF) treatment on cognitive function, sleep quality, anxiety and depression levels and quality of life in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCI-ND). This study was a retrospective study that included a total of 128 patients diagnosed with VCI-ND at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College from July 2022 to July 2024. The patients were divided into an EEG-BF group and a control group in accordance with whether they received EEG-BF treatment or not. Both groups received standard vascular risk factor management. The EEG-BF group separately received EEG-BF intervention two times a week for 12 weeks. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to perform 1:1 nearest-neighbour matching between the two groups with respect to baseline characteristics. The matching variables included age; education; place of residence; family income; type of health insurance; number of underlying diseases; and pre-intervention scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The main outcome measures were the PSQI, MoCA, SAS, 36-item Short-Form Questionnaire (SF-36) and SDS before and after treatment. After PSM, the baseline covariates between the two groups were well balanced, with no significant differences. The Love plot showed a significant decrease in standardised differences in covariates after matching. After 12 weeks of intervention, the EEG-BF group was significantly better than the control group in terms of MoCA scores (p = 0.013), SAS scores (p = 0.002), SDS scores (p = 0.004) and some of the SF-36 dimensions, and the within-group before and after comparisons was statistically different (p &lt; 0.05). The sleep quality of the EEG-BF group improved after treatment, whereas that of the control group exhibited no notable variation before and after the intervention (p &gt; 0.05). EEG-BF may help improve cognitive function, sleep quality, emotional state and life quality in patients with VCI-ND, offering a promising individualised non-pharmacological intervention for this population. Future multicentre, prospective studies are needed to further validate its prolonged therapeutic effect and neuromodulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The DARPA OP TEMPO program seeks to accelerate warfighter readiness by supplying instructors with objective, automatic assessments of team performance during simulation training. To that end, we created the Bio-behavioral Team Dynamics Measurement System (BioTDMS), a multimodal sensing and analytics pipeline that discovers bio-behavioral 'signatures' emanating from within the human body and through team-member interactions that predict team performance. BioTDMS employs a layered symbolic dynamics model that converts time-aligned neural, cardio-respiratory, eye tracking, and verbal data, collected using a multimodal sensor suite. Moving-window entropy and mutual information computed across the symbolic sensor space yield real-time metrics that quantify team adaptability following perturbation (e.g., 'training injects') and distribution of team members' influence across biological and behavioral subsystems. These features feed a multitask, multi-kernel learning engine that refines performance prediction while preserving explainability through team construct mapping and a command-line user interface. We present preliminary results from field testing a full physical and computational implementation of BioTDMS during Fire Support Team (FiST) training exercises at the U.S. Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, CA. An onsite team instrumented five-person FiST crews with multimodal sensor suites. Sensor data were processed by BioTDMS for real-time and post hoc analytics. BioTDMS currently accounts for 90&#xe2;&#xaf;% of variance in a subjective team perform-ance assessment made by instructors, with improvements expected upon further refinements of BioTDMS modeling components. These findings demonstrate BioTDMS's potential as an operational tool for automatic, objective team assessments. Future assessments within air combat teams, including configura-tions with human-autonomy teaming, will evaluate the generalizability of BioTDMS.",

    "abstract": "Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are rare intestinal epithelial cells producing multiple hormones that regulate essential aspects of digestion and energy. EEC subtypes, their hormone repertoire and differentiation mechanisms from intestinal stem cells have been characterized in the adult intestine. Although EECs must be functional from birth because their absence leads to severe intestinal malabsorption in newborns, the processes that determine their subtype specification during development remain largely unknown. We used mouse embryos, human pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoid models and single-cell transcriptomics to characterize EEC lineages and dynamics during development. Our findings demonstrate that in both mice and humans, the majority of EECs are specified during development through similar differentiation trajectories to those observed in the adult intestine. This suggests that EEC subtype specification occurs independently of fully organized crypt-villus structures and stimulation by diet or microbiota. However, the emergence of certain EEC subtypes depends on tissue maturation. Finally, our integrative approach infers lineage-specific regulators dynamically, identifying new candidates controlling EEC differentiation in the developing human gut.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common and burdensome manifestations of neurocognitive disorders but the characterization of their natural evolution over time is limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the longitudinal progression and heterogeneity of NPS across Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We systematically reviewed observational longitudinal studies published between 2000 and 2024 assessing the prevalence or severity of NPS at &#x2265;&#xa0;2 time points using validated instruments. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to pool changes in prevalence (risk difference) and severity (standardized mean difference [SMD]) at short-term (&lt;&#xa0;12&#xa0;months), mid-term (12 to &lt;&#xa0;24&#xa0;months), and long-term (&#x2265;&#xa0;24&#xa0;months) follow-up. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. Subgroup analyses were conducted by type of neurocognitive disorder. We included 26 studies comprising 5509 participants. Apathy was the most prevalent NPS at baseline (45%), followed by irritability (35%) and depression (35%). Over time, most NPS demonstrated progressive increases in prevalence, with agitation (+16%) and apathy (+15%) emerging most frequently at long-term follow-up. Severity of most NPS remained stable, except for apathy and aberrant motor behavior, which increased significantly, and sleep disturbances, which improved. Global NPS burden increased significantly at long-term (SMD +2.04). Heterogeneity of trajectories was notably high and varied across symptoms and disorders. Subgroup analyses in AD confirmed increases in apathy, delusions, and hallucinations over time. NPS exhibit distinct and heterogeneous longitudinal patterns in neurocognitive disorders. Greater understanding of these trajectories may inform clinical management, prognostication, and the timing of interventions.",

    "abstract": "One in four older adults in the United States (US) reports being socially isolated or lonely, leading to increases in the odds of having heart disease, a stroke, and dementia. Physical activity (PA) has many benefits in this population, both physical and psychological. One such type of PA growing in popularity is pickleball. Our objective was to understand the relationship of pickleball participation with perceived loneliness and social isolation among older adults in the US. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey of 825 US adults over age 50&#x2009;years. We compared the effect of 3 levels of pickleball play history (never played (NP); played previously, not currently (PP); and currently play (CP)) on loneliness and social isolation. Most participants (65%) who had ever played pickleball were still currently playing. Over half of the sample (57%) reported being lonely. The adjusted odds of being lonely were greater for NP (adjusted odds ratio 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.53, 1.04-2.23), and PP (1.95, 1.24-3.05) groups. Compared to NP, PP, and CP groups were found to be associated with having made more social connections and reporting a greater number of social engagements, thus appearing to experience less social isolation. Older adults who participate in pickleball had an associated decreased perceived loneliness and reduced risk of social isolation. Further research is needed to determine if recommendations for those able to physically participate in pickleball might result in similar changes to loneliness and social isolation.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the efficacy of \"Tongdu Tiaoshen\" needling (draging the Governor Vessel and normalizing mental activities) in the treatment of insomnia in the clinical real world and to explore the influencing factors of clinical efficacy. A total of 227 patients with insomnia were given \"Tongdu Tiaoshen\" (freeing the Governor Vessel and regulating the spirit) needling, with electroacupuncture (EA) applied at Baihui (GV20), Yintang (GV24+), bilateral Shenmen (HT7), and bilateral Sanyinjiao (SP6) for 30 min each time. Based on the number of treatments, the patients were divided into 2 cohorts:the &lt; 6 times group (227 cases) and the&#x2265;6 times group (74 cases). Then, propensity score matching was used to balance the confounding factors between the cohorts. Patients with &lt; 6 treatments within 4 weeks were included in the low-frequency group (37 cases), and patients with&#x2265;6 treatments were included in the high-frequency group (37 cases). Propensity score matching was used to balance the confounding factors between the cohorts. Before and after treatment, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), fatigue severity scale (FSS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) scores of the patients were evaluated. The therapeutic effect was assessed. Following the treatment, the PSQI and FSS scores of the high-frequency treatment group and the low-frequency treatment group were all decreased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), while the FSS score of the high-frequency treatment group was lower than that of the low-frequency treatment group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in SDS scores between the two groups. The high-frequency treatment group showed a significant decrease (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) in SAS scores after treatment than that before treatment, whereas no significant difference was observed in the low-frequency group, additionally, the high-frequency treatment group was lower than the low-frequency treatment group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). \"Tongdu Tiaoshen\" needling can effectively treat insomnia, relieve fatigue and anxiety in patients with insomnia. The number of treatment significantly affects the clinical efficacy in treating insomnia. <b>&#x76ee;&#x7684;</b>: &#x5229;&#x7528;&#x771f;&#x5b9e;&#x533b;&#x7597;&#x73af;&#x5883;&#x4e2d;&#x7684;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x8bca;&#x7597;&#x6570;&#x636e;&#xff0c;&#x89c2;&#x5bdf;&#x201c;&#x901a;&#x7763;&#x8c03;&#x795e;&#x201d;&#x9488;&#x6cd5;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x5931;&#x7720;&#x75c7;&#x7684;&#x7597;&#x6548;&#xff0c;&#x63a2;&#x8ba8;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x7597;&#x6548;&#x7684;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x56e0;&#x7d20;&#x3002;<b>&#x65b9;&#x6cd5;</b>: 227&#x540d;&#x5931;&#x7720;&#x75c7;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x91c7;&#x7528;&#x201c;&#x901a;&#x7763;&#x8c03;&#x795e;&#x201d;&#x9488;&#x6cd5;&#xff0c;&#x7535;&#x9488;&#x767e;&#x4f1a;&#x3001;&#x5370;&#x5802;&#x3001;&#x795e;&#x95e8;&#xff08;&#x53cc;&#x4fa7;&#xff09;&#x3001;&#x4e09;&#x9634;&#x4ea4;&#xff08;&#x53cc;&#x4fa7;&#xff09;&#xff0c;&#x6bcf;&#x6b21;30 min&#x3002;&#x57fa;&#x4e8e;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x6b21;&#x6570;&#x5c06;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x5206;&#x4e3a;&lt;6&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#xff08;227&#x4f8b;&#xff09;&#x548c;&#x2265;6&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#xff08;74&#x4f8b;&#xff09;&#x4e24;&#x4e2a;&#x961f;&#x5217;&#xff0c;&#x518d;&#x5229;&#x7528;&#x503e;&#x5411;&#x6027;&#x8bc4;&#x5206;&#x5339;&#x914d;&#x5e73;&#x8861;&#x961f;&#x5217;&#x95f4;&#x7684;&#x6df7;&#x6742;&#x56e0;&#x7d20;&#xff0c;&#x5c06;4&#x5468;&#x5185;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x6b21;&#x6570;&lt;6&#x6b21;&#x7684;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x7eb3;&#x5165;&#x4f4e;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#xff08;37&#x4f8b;&#xff09;&#xff0c;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x6b21;&#x6570;&#x2265;6&#x6b21;&#x7684;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x7eb3;&#x5165;&#x9ad8;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#xff08;37&#x4f8b;&#xff09;&#x3002;&#x4e8e;&#x9996;&#x6b21;&#x5c31;&#x8bca;&#x53ca;&#x5c31;&#x8bca;&#x540e;&#x7b2c;4&#x5468;&#x8bc4;&#x4f30;&#x5339;&#x5179;&#x5821;&#x7761;&#x7720;&#x8d28;&#x91cf;&#x6307;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x8868;&#xff08;PSQI&#xff09;&#x3001;&#x75b2;&#x52b3;&#x4e25;&#x91cd;&#x7a0b;&#x5ea6;&#x91cf;&#x8868;&#xff08;FSS&#xff09;&#x3001;&#x6291;&#x90c1;&#x81ea;&#x8bc4;&#x91cf;&#x8868;&#xff08;SDS&#xff09;&#x53ca;&#x7126;&#x8651;&#x81ea;&#x8bc4;&#x91cf;&#x8868;&#xff08;SAS&#xff09;&#x8bc4;&#x5206;&#x3002;<b>&#x7ed3;&#x679c;</b>: &#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x540e;&#x9ad8;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#x53ca;&#x4f4e;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;PSQI&#x8bc4;&#x5206;&#x5747;&#x4e0b;&#x964d;&#xff08;<i>P</i>&lt;0.05&#xff09;&#x4f46;&#x4e24;&#x7ec4;&#x95f4;&#x6bd4;&#x8f83;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x65e0;&#x7edf;&#x8ba1;&#x5b66;&#x610f;&#x4e49;;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x540e;&#x4e24;&#x7ec4;FSS&#x8bc4;&#x5206;&#x5747;&#x4e0b;&#x964d;&#xff08;<i>P</i>&lt;0.05&#xff09;&#x4e14;&#x9ad8;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#x4f4e;&#x4e8e;&#x4f4e;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#xff08;<i>P</i>&lt;0.05&#xff09;;&#x4f4e;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#x53ca;&#x9ad8;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x524d;&#x540e;&#x53ca;&#x7ec4;&#x95f4;&#x6bd4;&#x8f83;SDS&#x8bc4;&#x5206;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x5747;&#x65e0;&#x7edf;&#x8ba1;&#x5b66;&#x610f;&#x4e49;;&#x9ad8;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x540e;SAS&#x8bc4;&#x5206;&#x964d;&#x4f4e;&#xff08;<i>P</i>&lt;0.05&#xff09;&#x4e14;&#x4f4e;&#x4e8e;&#x4f4e;&#x9891;&#x6b21;&#x7ec4;&#xff08;<i>P</i>&lt;0.05&#xff09;&#x3002;&#x503e;&#x5411;&#x6027;&#x5339;&#x914d;&#x524d;&#x540e;&#x7ed3;&#x679c;&#x4e00;&#x81f4;&#x3002;<b>&#x7ed3;&#x8bba;</b>: &#x201c;&#x901a;&#x7763;&#x8c03;&#x795e;&#x201d;&#x9488;&#x6cd5;&#x53ef;&#x6709;&#x6548;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x5931;&#x7720;&#x75c7;&#xff0c;&#x7f13;&#x89e3;&#x5931;&#x7720;&#x75c7;&#x60a3;&#x8005;&#x7684;&#x75b2;&#x52b3;&#x611f;&#x53ca;&#x7126;&#x8651;&#x60c5;&#x7eea;;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x6b21;&#x6570;&#x663e;&#x8457;&#x5f71;&#x54cd;&#x201c;&#x901a;&#x7763;&#x8c03;&#x795e;&#x201d;&#x9488;&#x6cd5;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x5931;&#x7720;&#x75c7;&#x7684;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x7597;&#x6548;&#x3002;.",

    "abstract": "To explore the mechanisms of moxibustion in treating obese mice through its regulatory effects on mitochondrial brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), PR domain-containing protein 16 (Prdm16), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1&#x3b1;) in abdominal adipose tissue, and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway in the hypothalamus of obese mice. C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the control group, model group, moxibustion group, and sham control group, with 10 mice in each group. An obese mouse model was established by feeding a high-fat diet. Moxibustion was applied mildly at a distance of 3-5 cm from the\"Zhongwan\"(CV12) with a temperature maintained at (46&#xb1;1)&#x2103; in the moxibustion group. In the sham control group, moxibustion was applied at a distance of 8-10 cm from CV12 with a temperature maintained at (38&#xb1;1)&#x2103;. Changes in body weight and food intake were observed before and after treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the levels of serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and hypothalamic cAMP. The mass of abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) was assessed. Histopathological changes in adipose tissue were observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the mRNA and protein expression of UCP1, Prdm16, and PGC-1&#x3b1; in abdominal adipose tissue, as well as the expression of PKA and CREB in the hypothalamus. Compared with the control group, the model group showed increased body weight, food intake, serum TC and TG levels (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), as well as increased abdominal WAT mass (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and significantly enlarged adipocyte volume in abdominal adipose tissue. Mice in the model group showed decreased mRNA and protein expression of UCP1, Prdm16, and PGC-1&#x3b1; in abdominal adipose tissue, as well as decreased mRNA and protein expression of PKA and CREB in the hypothalamus (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), along with decreased levels of hypothalamic cAMP (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Compared with the model group and sham control group, the moxibustion group showed decreased body weight and food intake (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05), decreased serum TC and TG levels, and abdominal WAT mass (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), along with reduced adipocyte diameter in abdominal adipose tissue. Moreover, compared with the model group and sham control group, the moxibustion group showed increased mRNA and protein expression of UCP1, Prdm16, and PGC-1&#x3b1; in abdominal adipose tissue, and the mRNA and protein expression of PKA and CREB in the hypothalamus (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), as well as increased levels of hypothalamic cAMP (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Moxibustion can enhance the mRNA and protein expression of UCP1, Prdm16, and PGC-1&#x3b1; in WAT of obese mice, improving obesity and lipid metabolism. Its mechanism may involve the regulation of the hypothalamic cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. <b>&#x76ee;&#x7684;</b>:

    "abstract": "To observe whether the effect of electroacupuncture(EA) on the improvement of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammation and gastric motility in diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) rats is exerted through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase(AMPK) and the protection of mitochondrial homeostasis, so as to explore the mechanism of EA in the prevention and treatment of DGP. Forty SD rats were randomly divided into the control group and modeling group, and the ones in modeling group were injected with 2% streptozotocin and fed with high-glucose and high-fat diet irregularly. The 20 successfully modeled rats were randomized into the model group and EA group with 10 rats each. Rats in the EA group received EA at \"Zusanli\" (ST36), \"Liangmen\" (ST21) and \"Sanyinjiao\" (SP6) with sparse and dense waves of 20 Hz/100 Hz for 15 min, while rats in the control and model group received bundled controls. Blood glucose, general symptoms, gastric emptying rate and small intestinal propulsion rate were observed in each group. Hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining was used to observe the pathological changes of gastric antrum tissues. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of AMPK, phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), and NLRP3 in gastric antrum tissue, and transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the mitochondrial ultrastructure in gastric antrum cells. Dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescent probe was used to detect the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the JC-1 method was used to detect changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, while a biochemical assay kit was employed to measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in gastric antrum tissue. After modeling, compared with the control group, the blood glucose levels and general symptom scores of rats in the modeling group were significantly increased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) while gastric emptying rate and intestinal propulsion rate were significantly decreased(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). After intervention, compared with the control group, blood glucose and symptom scores remained elevated, gastric emptying rate and intestinal propulsion rate were significantly decreased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01) in the model group, while gastric antrum tissues showed obvious inflammatory damage. Meanwhile, the model group exhibited decreased AMPK and p-AMPK protein expression levels and increased NLRP3 protein expression level(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), mitochondrial structure was severely damaged, with an increase in the intracellular ROS content (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential level and ATP content (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Compared with the model group, rats in the EA group had lower blood glucose levels and general symptom scores (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) and higher gastrointestinal propulsion (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), and EA had improved gastric histopathology. The expression of AMPK and p-AMPK proteins were increased while NLRP3 protein was decreased in gastric antrum tissue (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The ultrastructure of mitochondria was improved, and ROS content was decreased (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01), the mitochondrial membrane potential level and ATP content were elevated (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). EA may improve DGP by activating AMPK to improve damaged mitochondrial structure and function and promote the restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and its mediated inflammation in gastric antrum tissues. <b>&#x76ee;&#x7684;</b>:

    "abstract": "diabetes is undergoing an epidemiologic transition in sub-Saharan Africa, driven by factors such as the westernization of the African diet and changes in personal lifestyle. This transition of the African diet is seen more in urban than rural communities. Dietary counseling is subject to non-adherence because people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are often counseled on diets that are usually difficult to come by in rural communities, and are unpalatable for some. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate dietary non-adherence and perceived barriers to the recommended diet among individuals living with T2DM in a rural community in Ghana. a descriptive cross-sectional survey design with a quantitative approach was used to assess the dietary adherence/non-adherence to dietary counseling of 208 T2DM participants receiving care at the new Edubiase government hospital. Dietary non-adherence was measured as an outcome variable against predictors such as socio-demographic factors, biological risk factors, duration of T2DM, presence of comorbidities (hypertension), and knowledge of T2DM. females were the majority, 73.6% (n=153), and the average age was 58 (SD &#xb1;11.9). The prevalence of non-adherence was 39.42% (n=82). About 24.5% (n=51) of the participants ate fruits and vegetables 25% (n=52) every time in their main meal. A total of 43.3 % (n=90) of the participants were engaged in inappropriate dietary habits. The majority cited food unavailability 84.6% (n=176), inaccessibility 80.8% (n=164), and financial constraints 60.1% (n=125) as perceived barriers to dietary non-adherence. The majority, 65.9% (n=137) of the participants, indicated that food preferences and taste contribute to non-adherence to diabetic diets. Among participants who adhered to the recommended diet, females with tertiary education and T2DM onset of less than 5 years were associated with higher adherence (females -aOR = 7.33, 95% CI = 2.33-22.99, P = .001, aOR = 3.69, 95% CI = 1.53-8.88, P = .001). Participants who did not use complementary herbal remedies had higher odds of adhering to dietary recommendations compared to those who used herbal remedies (aOR = 6.53, 95% CI = 2.34-18.23, P = .001). Among participants who were not adhering to recommended diets were those who had poor knowledge of T2DM management and a high Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) (aOR = 7.97, 95% CI = 2.61-24.31, P = .001, aOR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01-0.33, P = .001). the high rates of non-compliance with dietary recommendations underscore the need for comprehensive and targeted interventions to address the multifaceted barriers faced by persons living with T2DM in rural communities.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of total resistance exercise (TRX), suspension training on the specialized balance ability of surfing athletes. A total of 32 Chinese National Surfing Team athletes were randomly assigned to TRX suspension training group (TRX group) and traditional balance training group (TB group), both undergoing an 8-week intervention training program consisting of three sessions per week lasting approximately 30 minutes each to improve balance ability. The balance board lateral squat specialized balance ability test was administered at different intervention phases to examine changes in participants' specialized balance ability. Following the 8-week intervention, both training modalities demonstrated significant improvements in surfing specialized balance metrics relative to baseline (<i>p</i>&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01 for all comparisons). Inter-group comparisons revealed statistically superior outcomes for TRX suspension training, with marked divergence emerging at the 5-week assessment (<i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01, |d| = 1.062 &gt; 0.8) that intensified through intervention completion (<i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.000&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01, |d| = 1.417 &gt; 0.8). Both 8 weeks of TRX suspension training and traditional balance training were effective in enhancing the specialized balance of surfers, but TRX suspension training was superior to traditional training in terms of enhancement, and this advantage was significantly demonstrated after 5 weeks and continued until the end of the training. TRX suspension training aligns with the balance demands of surfing, making it an effective training method. It is feasible for coaches to formulate customized TRX suspension training regimens tailored to surfers' proficiency levels and core stability, integrating sport-specific movement patterns to enhance athletes' neuromuscular adaptations for improved biomechanical control during dynamic wave navigation.",

    "abstract": "To develop dysphagia-friendly, high-protein foods, this study selected xanthan gum (XG) as a texture modifier in a lotus root starch-whey protein isolate (LRS-WPI) composite system. According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) framework, the incorporation of XG reduced the texture level of LRS-WPI gels from level 7 to level 4, enhancing their suitability for dysphagia patients. However, low addition-XG (0.05&#xa0;%-0.10&#xa0;%) promoted macromolecular clustering (&#x2265;1000&#xa0;&#x3bc;m) through bridging interactions with WPI, which might not be conducive to the comfort of the swallowing process. While higher XG content increased gel viscosity beyond 600 cp and minimized oral friction, demonstrating its potential to prevent choking. During co-heating, XG raised the pasting temperature by approximately 10&#xa0;&#xb0;C and reduced amylose leaching. In vitro digestion revealed that 0.60&#xa0;% XG reduced rapidly digestible starch by 30.07&#xa0;% compared to the LRS. Results of water migration, intermolecular interactions, and microstructure suggested that XG disrupted the WPI gel network via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, and acted as a \"lubricant\" through self-assembled flexible gels. Additionally, XG hindered LRS digestion by constructing a physical barrier and competing for water. This article would offer valuable insights into improving the friendliness of high-protein dysphagia foods.",

    "abstract": "Although disagreement persists as to the precise nature of the diet of Paranthropus, there is a consensus that the food resources consumed by Paranthropus were in some way mechanically challenging to process (i.e., by being \"hard\" and/or \"tough\"). While the highly derived feeding apparatus of Paranthropus likely conferred biomechanical performance advantages while consuming certain types of foods, it may also have limited the ability of these early hominins to respond to selection and evolve rapidly toward new adaptive peaks (i.e., reduced their evolvability). We employed viability selection modeling to test this hypothesis. Viability selection simulations were performed using Paranthropus boisei (OH 5), Australopithecus afarensis (A.L. 444-2), and Homo habilis (KNM-ER 1813) specimens. We simulated the generation-to-generation evolution of biomechanically informative linear dimensions in a population where an individual's probability of survival (i.e., viability) was determined by its distance to a predetermined adaptive peak. The number of generations required for an evolving population to reach a new adaptive peak was used as a measure of evolvability. The results showed that the mean number of generations from P. boisei to H. habilis was larger than in the reverse direction when modeled using either chimpanzee or human estimates of population variance/covariance. It took longer for P. boisei to evolve toward Au. afarensis than in the reverse direction, but only with the chimpanzee estimates of population variance/covariance. The results suggest that P. boisei faced limitations in cranial evolvability, particularly if selection favored a cranial morphology similar to H. habilis.",

    "abstract": "Children from poor socioeconomic status (SES) households in Bangladesh and other developing countries face a heightened risk of chronic undernutrition, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the association between poor SES and chronic undernutrition in children and explores the mediating factors driving this relationship. A cross-sectional study was conducted in urban and rural areas of Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. A two-phase sampling strategy was employed: five wards and five union parishads (UPs) were randomly selected, followed by stratified random sampling of 664 households (332 urban, 332 rural). Chronic undernutrition was assessed using height-for-age z-scores. SES was the primary exposure, with five mediating variables: inadequate dietary diversity and delayed breastfeeding initiation, insufficient micronutrient supplementation, disease occurrence, inappropriate health-seeking behaviors, and poor living conditions (e.g., indoor air pollution). Mediation analysis was performed using the Baron and Kenny approach. The prevalence of chronic undernutrition was 23.9%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that children from middle and high SES households had 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57-0.77) times lower odds of chronic undernutrition, respectively, compared to poor-SES children. Mediation analysis identified key contributing factors: inadequate dietary diversity (17.3%), the lack of use of iodized salt (8.8%), history of recent acute respiratory infection (11%), incomplete vaccination (11.1%), and use of unclean cooking fuel (13.1%). Poor SES significantly increases the risk of chronic undernutrition in children, mediated by factors such as inadequate diet, disease, incomplete immunization, and poor living conditions. Targeted interventions addressing these mediators could reduce SES-based disparities in child undernutrition.",

Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with sixteen older Korean immigrant participants. Interviews explored participant motivations for joining nature walking groups and the specific health benefits that were derived from participation in such groups. Thematic analysis was used to identify major themes in collected data. Analysis revealed three primary themes: (a) improvement of psychological wellbeing that was characterized by stress reduction, emotional resilience, ad alleviation of loneliness; (b) development of cultural bonding that was demonstrated by the building of enhanced interpersonal relationships and cultural exchanges among participants; and (c) increased physical health that was indicated by improved mobility, endurance, and physical strength. Our findings underscore the importance of culturally sensitive leisure activities such as nature walking that significantly enhance the psychological, social, and physical health of older Korean immigrants. These insights are valuable for designing targeted health promotion interventions whose goal is to improve the quality of life and facilitate the healthy aging of this population.",

    "abstract": "Young adults (18-25) face significant risk for weight gain and transitioning to a higher body mass index category when compared to other adult groups. As active internet users, they encounter food-related content across digital platforms, yet little is known about their behavioural and cognitive responses to this compound exposure. This pre-registered mixed-methods systematic review features primary studies about participants aged 18 to 25 exposed to digital food communication and assessed for behavioural or cognitive responses towards food and nutrition. We evaluate consumption and food purchase as behavioural responses; intentions to consume and/or purchase, and attitudes towards food and nutrition as cognitive responses. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Global Index Medicus, and Business Source Ultimate for studies published from database inception to August 1, 2024. Quality appraisals were conducted using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form, the ROB1 Tool for randomised trials, the JBI Quasi-Experiment Checklist for quasi-experiments and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies. We used a three-pronged method for analysis. Meta-analyses combined findings from randomised trials for behavioural and cognitive responses, while observational studies were summarised narratively. The thematic synthesis approach informed our qualitative synthesis of young adults' narratives of their responses after exposure to digital food communication. Finally, a cross-study matrix synthesised analytical qualitative themes and quantitative findings. Of the 6132 studies identified, 45 are included in the systematic review, representing 8,914 young adults in 16 countries. Meta-analyses on behavioural and cognitive responses demonstrate statistical significance with effect sizes of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.18-0.50) and 0.19 (95% CI: 0.10-0.28), respectively. Observational studies confirmed the findings of the meta-analyses. Difficulty deciphering what represents good nutrition, critical distinctions when engaging with content viewed as helpful versus misleading and balancing intentions versus actual behaviours were barriers to the effectiveness of digital food communication. Using a cross-study synthesis matrix, we developed ten recommendations to improve digital dietary interventions and their assessed implementation by experimental studies in the review. Our results illustrate the need to approach digital food communication as a digital determinant of dietary health for young adults, shaping behaviours and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with occupational factors emerging as significant yet modifiable risk factors. This comprehensive review evaluates the association between various occupational exposures-including job stress, long working hours, shift work, physical activity at work, and exposure to hazardous substances-and CVD risk. Using the GRADE framework, we assessed the strength of evidence for each risk factor. Job stress, long working hours, night shift work, and carbon monoxide exposure demonstrated moderate evidence linking them to increased CVD risk, while occupational noise, air pollutants, and extreme temperatures had limited evidence. Physical activity at work and exposure to toxic metals showed inconclusive findings due to inconsistencies and indirectness in study populations. This review suggests that evaluating occupational exposures is essential for the early identification and management of individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, and emphasizes that workplace interventions and health policies should prioritize reducing specific risk factors-such as job stress, long working hours, and hazardous exposures-to prevent CVD at both individual and population levels.",

    "abstract": "Erythrina edulis (pajuro) is a native Andean legume with promising nutritional and functional properties. Its seeds possess high-quality protein content and a favorable amino acid profile, characterized by residues such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, Leu, Ile, Val, Pro, and Gly, which are critical precursors of bioactive peptides. Upon enzymatic hydrolysis, these residues contribute to diverse bioactivities, including antioxidant (Trp, Tyr), antihypertensive (Pro at the C-terminal), and antidiabetic (branched-chain residues at the N-terminal) functions, making it a valuable source for bioactive peptide production. This review highlights current evidence regarding the nutraceutical potential of peptides derived from E. edulis proteins, especially those generated via enzymatic hydrolysis and simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Based on a systematic literature search in Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, this review highlights that these peptides exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antioxidant, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and anti-obesity effects, and are largely associated with low-molecular-weight fractions. The multifunctional nature of these peptides, together with E. edulis's rich composition of polyphenols, flavonoids, and essential minerals, supports their consideration as sustainable ingredients in functional food development. However, limitations such as a lack of in vivo studies, challenges in process scalability, and underutilization of the crop remain. Future perspectives emphasize the integration of biotechnological tools, including ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis and bioinformatics-guided peptide design, to enhance bioactivity discovery and application. This review provides a foundation for the revalorization of E. edulis as a source of nutraceutical peptides, promoting their inclusion in food systems aimed at health promotion and sustainability.",

Linear regression models adjusted for age, parity, BMI, smoking, country of birth, and timing of measurements were used. A subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate whether activity patterns returned to pre-pandemic levels during year 2022. Compared with before COVID-19, daily sedentary behavior increased by 6.6% points (&#x3b2; 6.6, CI 5.4, 7.8), and daily physical activity levels decreased by 6.7% points (&#x3b2; - 6.7, CI - 7.8, -&#xa0;5.7) during the pandemic. In 2022, daily sedentary behavior was still increased by 7.2% points (&#x3b2; 7.2, CI 5.3, 9.2), and daily physical activity levels decreased by 7.3% points (&#x3b2; - 7.3, CI - 9.1, - 5.5), compared with before COVID-19. Hence, there was a modest increase in sedentary behavior and a small decrease in physical activity after the pandemic outbreak, and these changes were still present during 2022. It is important that health providers are aware of the potential negative changes in activity patterns among pregnant women following a pandemic or a similar situation.",

Using the Apple Heart &amp; Movement Study (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;213,593 participants; &gt;149 million participant-days), our observational analysis shows that this non-invasive and passively collected aging clock accurately predicts chronological age and captures signs of healthy aging. Participants with an elevated PpgAge gap (i.e., predicted age greater than chronological age) have significantly higher diagnosis rates of heart disease, heart failure, and diabetes. Elevated PpgAge gap is also a significant predictor of incident heart disease events (and new diagnoses) when controlling for relevant risk factors. PpgAge also associates with behavior, including smoking, exercise, and sleep. Longitudinally, PpgAge exhibits a sharp increase during pregnancy and concurrent with certain types of cardiac events.",

Using these techniques in a classic study published in Diabetes, Fueger et&#xa0;al. demonstrated that overexpression in skeletal muscle of hexokinase II (HKII), the enzyme responsible for intracellular glucose phosphorylation, enhanced MGU in insulin-sensitive but not in insulin-resistant mice. Conversely, HKII overexpression enhanced MGU in insulin-resistant mice in response to exercise. Since exercise reduces barriers of glucose delivery and transport, this suggested that these two processes contribute to the dysregulation of MGU in insulin-resistant states. These fundamental findings have spurred subsequent studies highlighting the contribution of glucose delivery and transport to the regulation of MGU in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Social media has shown promise in supporting young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) by providing information and emotional support. Although previous qualitative studies have investigated young people's self-reported use of social media for self-management, their patterns of actual use remain underexplored. Furthermore, different platforms may serve different functions or attract different types of engagement, making it important to examine how the patterns of actual use vary across them. This study aimed to identify and describe the topics that young people with T1DM discuss online and to identify differences in content across platforms. We collected data from Twitter and two forums (Reddit and Diabetes.co.uk) spanning from January 2020 to January 2024, identifying young people with T1DM using rule-based criteria and profile age information. An efficient analysis pipeline, integrating topic modeling with large language model (LLM) summarizing and human verification, was applied to identify the discussion topics. We analyzed 1765 tweets and 1259 forum posts by young people with T1DM and identified 24 topics. Among these topics, 7 (29.2%) were common across all platforms (Twitter and forums topic sizes, respectively): blood glucose management (n=70, 9%, and n=88, 16.6%), community and friendship (n=33, 4.3%, and n=51, 9.6%), COVID-19 (n=76, 9.8%, and n=13, 2.4%), diabetes and diet (n=81, 10.5%, and n=38, 7.2%), diabetes devices (n=97, 12.5%, and n=128, 24.1%), emotional and psychological expression (n=100, 12.9%, and n=124, 23.4%), and financial challenges (n=141,18.2%, and n=23, 4.3%). In addition, 7 (29.2%) topics were unique to Twitter: advocacy and awareness (n=35, 4.5%), diaversaries reflection (n=24, 3.1%), daily life and adaptation (n=27, 3.5%), misunderstanding of T1DM (n=25, 3.2%), educating and raising awareness (n=19, 2.5%), insulin prescription frustration (n=21, 2.7%), and experience with health care providers (n=25, 3.2%). Furthermore, 3 (12.5%) topics were unique to forums: diabetes complications (n=21, 4%), newly diagnosed and \"honeymoon\" experiences (n=21, 4%), and traveling with T1DM (n=24, 4.5%). Although our results confirmed social media's role in providing information and emotional and peer support, we also found that topics such as COVID-19, advocacy, and diabetes celebration are more frequently discussed in social media than in prior qualitative studies based on self-reporting. Platform-specific patterns are evident, with Twitter discussions being more immediate and experience driven, focusing on daily reflection, advocacy, awareness campaigns, and financial support, while forum-based platforms emphasize more in-depth discussions, where users seek and provide comprehensive advice, troubleshooting, and sustained peer support. Practitioners could consider the differences when designing digital interventions to ensure the delivery method aligns with the communication style and support needs of the target audience.",

    "abstract": "In Mexico, the maternal and child population continues to face a high burden of malnutrition, posing a persistent public health challenge. The health care system plays a crucial role, not only in addressing existing cases but also in preventing and detecting malnutrition early. Mobile health technologies have the potential to strengthen maternal and child health services by improving the quality, accessibility, and timeliness of nutritional care. The aim was to design, develop, and assess the usability and acceptance of a mobile app-CANMI (Calidad de la Atenci&#xf3;n Nutricional Materno Infantil; its Spanish acronym)-to monitor the quality of maternal and child nutritional care in primary health care units in Mexico. The framework of the CANMI app was based on 16 validated indicators designed to assess the quality of nutritional care during the preconception, pregnancy, postpartum, early childhood, and preschool stages. The app was developed for both iOS and Android systems using a user-centered design approach. Following development, we conducted a pilot usability study in a randomized sample of 18 primary health care units in Guanajuato, Mexico. Trained nutritionists implemented the app and collected usability data at the end of the initial use period and again 6 weeks later. To further explore user experience, semistructured online interviews were conducted to identify barriers, facilitators, and overall satisfaction with the app. The CANMI app allows the systematic registration of key indicators to assess the quality of nutritional care in primary health care settings. Users described the app as simple, intuitive, and visually appealing. Overall usability was rated positively, with a mean score of 71.13 (SD 11.68) on the System Usability Scale, indicating good acceptability. The app's offline functionality, streamlined interface, and efficiency in data collection were identified as key facilitators of use. Reported benefits included reduced time for data entry and perceived improvements in the quality of nutritional care. Identified barriers to integration included the need to use personal devices, user fatigue due to prolonged screen time, inconsistent clinical records, and limited time to incorporate the app into routine workflows. Importantly, the app encouraged and promoted improvements in documentation practices and heightened awareness among health personnel regarding the precision and clarity of their nutritional recommendations. The CANMI app provides a feasible and effective solution for monitoring the quality of maternal and child nutritional care in primary health settings. Its high usability and offline capabilities make it particularly suitable for low-connectivity environments. Beyond facilitating data collection, the app contributed to improved clinical documentation practices and enhanced health care provider awareness of care quality. Consequently, the app represents a promising digital tool to support the implementation of evidence-based, user-centered strategies aimed at strengthening maternal and child health services in resource-limited contexts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the principal characteristics of allergic diseases caused by common allergenic metals. For this, a thorough search of relevant information presented for 2018-2023 in the Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted. The study found that one third of the world's population suffers from allergies, and 20% of them are diagnosed with metal allergies. To date, 45 metals have been identified as causing allergic reactions. The main routes of exposure to metals are inhalation, contact, oral, and parenteral. The following diseases develop as a result of metal exposure: various types of contact dermatitis, urticaria, anaphylactic reactions, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, ulcerative colitis, arthralgia, stomatitis, gingivitis, and bronchial asthma. The main diagnostic method is the patch test. Allergy treatment depends on the type of allergic reaction. In case of immediate allergic reactions, emergency treatment with epinephrine is required. For diseases that develop as delayed allergic reactions, the use of corticosteroids and antihistamines is effective. Allergenic metals should be avoided to prevent the onset and development of allergies. For this, it is advisable to use gloves, protective creams, and masks. It is essential to carefully read the composition of the products used and individually select alternative non-allergenic materials. The prescription of a diet aimed at correcting the content of metals in the body improves the general condition of patients and reduces the severity of symptoms. Thus, metal allergy is a common pathology that causes the development of a wide range of diseases of varying severity.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing in low- and middle-income countries. Effective, culturally tailored interventions are needed for diabetes prevention. To evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-month, mosque-based, faith-integrated lifestyle intervention in reducing T2D incidence among adults with prediabetes in rural Bangladesh. This parallel-group, cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted from April 2022 to April 2023 across 8 rural mosque clusters in 5 districts of Bangladesh, with a 12-month follow-up. Adults (aged 25-65 years) were screened using a validated diabetes risk score. Individuals with high risk scores underwent oral glucose tolerance testing, and those with prediabetes (fasting blood glucose of 6.1-6.9 mmol/L, 2-hour blood glucose of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L [to convert to milligrams per deciliter, multiply by 18], or both, according to World Health Organization criteria) were included in this trial. Participants were randomized (1:1) by mosque cluster to the intervention or the control. After baseline assessments, participants who completed the 12-month follow-up were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The intervention group attended monthly mosque-based sessions integrating Islamic teachings with structured guidance on diet, physical activity, and behavior modification delivered by imams and trained female assistants. The control group received usual care (standard health advice including a health leaflet and referral to local health services) at enrollment. The primary outcome was the 12-month cumulative incidence of T2D. Secondary outcomes included changes in weight, body mass index (BMI), glycemic markers, lipid profiles, blood pressure, diabetes-related knowledge, physical activity, and quality of life. Of the 799 participants (mean [SD] age, 46.2 [11.6] years; 424 women [53.1%]) randomized, 641 completed the 12-month follow-up and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 341 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4 mosques) in the intervention group and 300 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4 mosques) in the control group. The intervention group had a significantly lower 12-month cumulative T2D incidence (9.8% [95% CI, 7.1%-13.5%]) vs the control group (17.1% [95% CI, 13.4%-21.6%]), with an absolute risk reduction of 7.3 percentage points (95% CI, 5.2-10.6 percentage points), a relative risk reduction of 42.5% (95% CI, 15.0%-70.0%), and a number needed to treat of 14 (95% CI, 9-39). In Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for clustering, the hazard ratio was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02), corresponding to a 25.0% reduction in diabetes risk. Secondary outcomes including weight, BMI, fasting glucose, 2-hour blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipid profiles, diabetes-related knowledge, physical activity, and quality of life also improved significantly more in the intervention group compared with the control group. In this cluster RCT involving adults with prediabetes, a culturally adapted, mosque-based lifestyle intervention significantly reduced T2D incidence over 12 months in rural Bangladesh. These results demonstrate the potential for scalable and cost-effective diabetes prevention programs in low-resource, Muslim-majority communities. ISRCTN Registry Identifier: ISRCTN91564707.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is an increasingly significant cause of premature liver mortality (PLM) in the US; however, the proportion that is preventable and the upstream factors remain poorly understood. To quantify the burden of preventable MASLD-PLM and identify county-level factors associated with its variation. Ecological, cross-sectional study of publicly available mortality and county-level data from January 2011 to December 2020 for US counties with complete covariate information. MASLD-PLM was defined as liver-related deaths where MASLD was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause, among decedents aged 75 years or younger for males and 80 years or younger for females. Statistical analysis was performed from February 2024 to August 2025. The primary outcome was the proportion of MASLD-PLM considered preventable, calculated by comparing county rates with the mean rate in the 3 states with the lowest mortality; to assess robustness, an alternative benchmark using the 10th percentile of the county-level MASLD-PLM distribution was also applied. Structural equation modeling estimated total, direct, and indirect associations of proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM with county-level factors. Associations are expressed as standardized &#x3b2; coefficients, representing the change in proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM (in SD units) per 1-SD change in each factor. In total, 2704 of 3143 counties with complete covariate information were included (county level composition: mean [SD] age, 41.17 [5.20] years; mean [SD] percentage female, 50.1% [2.3%]). Between 2011 and 2020, the mean annual MASLD-PLM was 18&#x202f;345 deaths (8.22 per 100&#x202f;000 population), with 8095 deaths (44.1%) to 10&#x202f;636 deaths (58.0%) estimated as preventable. The proportion of MASLD-PLM distribution was highly left-skewed, with 2182 counties (80.7%) having a preventable proportion of 70% or greater. Higher proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM occurred more often in rural counties and was associated with higher rates of physical inactivity (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31; 95% CI, 0.28-0.35), obesity (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.23; 95% CI, 0.18-0.27), preventable hospitalizations (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.15; 95% CI, 0.11-0.18), and diabetes (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.14). These factors were associated with upstream conditions including lower access to exercise-friendly environments, unfavorable food environments, and higher uninsurance rates. Findings were consistent when using an alternative benchmark based on the 10th percentile of county-level mortality rates. In this ecological cross-sectional study of US counties, most MASLD-PLM was preventable, with the highest burdens in rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and medically underserved areas. Multiple upstream community-level factors were associated with proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM and may warrant further evaluation in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to clinically evaluate the high-energy light-emitting device (Germinator) in preventing pain and oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods Sixty patients were selected, being randomly divided into two groups(n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30), according to preventive protocol: G1(Lasertherapy)-conventional low-intensity red laser protocol; G2(Germinator)-protocol with high-energy light-emitting device. Before and after these protocols, the pain and oral mucositis degrees were recorded by visual analog scale(VAS) for pain and World Health Organization(WHO) classification for oral mucositis. The VAS was used to assess pain symptoms, where 0 represented the absence of pain and 10 the highest pain score. The oral mucositis scoring was performed according to the WHO classification: grade 0(none), grade I(oral soreness, erythema), grade II(oral erythema, ulcers, solid and liquid diet tolerated), grade III(oral ulcers, liquid diet only), and grade IV(oral alimentation impossible). Statistical analysis was performed by Mann-Whitney U test(&#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;5%), in order to provide the intergroup comparison. Results The median (interquartile range-IQR) of pain score was 0.0(0.0-2.0) for G1 group(Lasertherapy), whereas it was 0.0(0.0-2.0) for G2 group(Germinator), revealing no statistically significant differences (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). The median(minimum and maximum value) of the oral mucositis score was 0.0(0.0-1.0) for G1 group(Lasertherapy), whereas it was 0.0(0.0-1.0) for G2 group(Germinator), also revealing no statistically significant differences (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Both treatments proved equally effective in preventing and controlling these symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy, recognizing that no statistically significant difference was found between the two preventive modalities. Conclusions The high-energy light-emitting device(Germinator) appears promising in preventing pain and oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) commonly causes pain and functional limitations, especially in hilly areas where mobility demands increase stress on the knee joint. High-Intensity Laser Therapy (HILT) and Ibuprofen Gel Phonophoresis (IGP) are both effective treatments, though comparative data is limited. Hence, we aimed to determine the effect of high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) (class-IV) and ibuprofen gel phonophoresis (IGP) for treating knee osteoarthritis (KOA) among people living in hilly terrain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 116 patients, aged 45 to 70, diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) based on the Kellgren-Lawrence classification (grades I to IV). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the HILT group, which received 15&#xa0;min of Class IV laser therapy in three phases, and the IGP group, which underwent 8&#xa0;min of phonophoresis treatment with ibuprofen gel. Both groups followed a home exercise program three times a week for three weeks. Outcomes were assessed using the WOMAC, Algometer, and SF-36 questionnaire. Age, height, weight and BMI of patients with KOA recruited were 57.2 (55.5 to 59.0) years, 161.8 (160.5 to 163.2) cm, 63.8 (62.3 to 65.3) kg and 24.3 (23.8 to 24.9) kg/m&#xb2;, respectively, with no significant difference between the groups. Both treatments significantly improved pain, stiffness, and physical function. HILT and IGP were both effective for treating KOA, with HILT showing significantly greater clinical improvement than IGP.

    "abstract": "[Purpose] The present study compared changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities during sleep following endurance exercise under either normoxic or hypoxic condition.[Methods] Ten young men (20.5 ± 0.2 years) were recruited for the study. All of them carried out three trials on different days: [1] pedaling exercise in hypoxia (FiO2: 14.5%; HYP), [2] pedaling exercise in normoxia (FiO2: 20.9%; NOR), and [3] rest in normoxia (REST). Each trial was separated at least one week, with randomized orders. The exercise in HYP and NOR trials consisted of 60 min of pedaling exercise at 60% of maximal oxygen uptake. During exercise, heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) were determined. Also, HRV was continuously monitored until next morning (17:00-8:00) to evaluate frequency domain HRV parameters and time domain HRV parameters. On the following morning, the scores of fatigues, sleepiness, vitality, and quality of sleep were measured by visual analog scale.[Results] During sleep, majority of frequency domain HRV parameters (LF, HF, LF/HF, Total Power) or time domain HRV parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, NN50) did not differ significantly among three trials, although the average of pNN50 was significantly lower in NOR and HYP trials.[Conclusion] Evening endurance exercise under hypoxic conditions did not exacerbate autonomic nerve activity during sleep compared to the same endurance exercise under normoxic conditions. However, despite different inspiratory oxygen levels during exercise (FiO2: 20.9% or 14.5%), evening endurance exercise may partially suppress parasympathetic nerve activity during sleep. These findings would apply to people who are involved in endurance exercise under hypoxic conditions.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThis cross-sectional study aims to explore the intricate relationships among chronotype, sleep quality, physical activity, and dietary intake in a diverse cohort of 3,072 (50.2% female) participants residing in İstanbul, Türkiye.MethodsThis study utilized established measurement tools, including the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) to assess chronotype, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to evaluate sleep quality, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) to measure physical activity, and a 24-h dietary recall method to assess dietary intake.ResultsThe findings of this study revealed compelling associations. Firstly, a robust association was observed between sleep quality and chronotype (OR: 2.265; 95% CI: 1.954–2.626; p &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as physical activity (OR: 0.836; 95% CI: 0.750–0.932; p = 0.002). Specifically, evening chronotypes are more likely to have poor sleep quality, while highly active individuals tend to report lower sleep quality. Transitioning from inactivity to high activity was associated with a 16.4% increase in the odds of transitioning from normal to poor sleep, while a shift from an evening to a morning chronotype was linked to a substantial 126.5-fold increase in the odds of moving from poor to normal sleep. Additionally, morning chronotypes also display distinctive dietary patterns, characterized by higher energy, protein, and fat intake, and reduced carbohydrate intake. Poor sleep quality is associated with increased energy and macronutrient consumption.DiscussionThese findings underscore the intricate relationships of chrononutrition within the context of sleep quality, physical activity, and dietary choices. The study underscores the significance of personalized interventions to effectively address specific health behaviors, highlighting the complexity of chrononutrition’s role in promoting overall health and wellbeing.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alternate day fasting combined with a low carbohydrate diet (ADF-LC) is an effective weight loss regimen. Whether the weight loss induced by ADF-LC can improve sleep, remains unknown. Objective: This study examined the effect an ADF-LC diet on sleep quality, duration, insomnia severity and the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. Methods: Adults with obesity (n = 31) participated in ADF (600 kcal \"fast day\"; ad libitum intake \"feast day\") with a low-carbohydrate diet (30% carbohydrates, 35% protein, and 35% fat). The 6-month trial consisted of a 3-month weight loss period followed by a 3-month weight maintenance period. Results: Reductions in body weight (-5 &#xb1; 1 kg, p < 0.001) and fat mass (-4 &#xb1; 1 kg, p < 0.01) were noted during the weight loss period, and these reductions were sustained during the weight maintenance period. Lean mass and visceral fat remained unchanged. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score indicated poor sleep quality at baseline (6.4 &#xb1; 0.7) with no change by month 3 or 6, versus baseline. ISI score indicated subthreshold insomnia at baseline (8.5 &#xb1; 1.0), with no change by month 3 or 6, versus baseline. The percent of subjects with high risk of obstructive sleep apnea at baseline was 45%, with no change by month 3 or 6. Wake time, bedtime, and sleep duration remained unchanged. Conclusion: The ADF-LC diet does not impact sleep quality, duration, insomnia severity or the risk of obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to find out how people with epilepsy in NE Thailand feel about their levels of stress, sleep, diet, exercise habits, and sex lives using a cross-sectional design. Two hundred and three people with epilepsy (PWE) were randomly recruited from a university epilepsy clinic in Khon Kaen and then completed an interview and a questionnaire. A total of 27.6% of the patients believed that diet had an influence on their epilepsy (of those who reported changes, 41.1% stopped consuming alcohol, while 32.1% stopped drinking caffeinated beverages). A total of 47.2% of the patients exercised at least three times per week, while 52.8% exercised two times or less a week. Daytime sleeping was prevalent, with 43.3% saying that they slept during the day frequently or every day. There were 44.3% of the patients who believed that their sex lives changed after the onset of epilepsy, with decreased sexual arousal being most commonly mentioned. A total of 76.4% of the patients said that they had medium or high levels of stress, and epilepsy was listed as the most common reason for their stress (50.2%). Focusing on the problem was the most common method to reduce stress (80.3%). The findings illuminate the need to increase attention towards improving and promoting self-management of epilepsy. As a whole, diet, exercise, sleep, stress reduction, and sex therapy can be valuable tools to improve the quality of life of people with epilepsy.",

As the KD is a subject of ongoing debate, we also present the existing evidence regarding its potential benefits in the aforementioned areas of body fat, muscle mass, and exercise performance.[Methods] A literature search was conducted using the keywords “ketogenic diet, low-carbohydrate diet, high-fat diet, body fat, muscle mass, and exercise performance” in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.[Results] The KD effectively reduced body fat in the short term and, preserved muscle mass during weight loss, however, its impact on exercise performance remains inconclusive owing to various factors.[Conclusion] While controversial, it is undeniable that the KD has the potential to affect body fat, muscle mass, and exercise performance. Consequently, additional research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms across various populations, optimize their implementation, and understand their long-term effects.",

The global prevalence of dementia, an umbrella term describing a set of symptoms which affect cognitive function, is set to rise dramatically by 2050, with current drug treatments inadequate. Diet and physical activity are modifiable factors in dementia, influencing both disease risk and pathophysiology. It has been known since the 1950s that a Mediterranean diet has positive health benefits. Over the past 25 years, a causal link has been shown between consumption of a Mediterranean diet and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly in Mediterranean countries. There have also been indications that a Mediterranean diet and increased physical activity can improve cognitive health and delay the onset of dementia. However, causative demonstrations of these effects, as well as the feasibility of implementing such lifestyle changes in a non‐Mediterranean population, are lacking. The new MedEx‐UK programme will attempt to address both these points.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBoth very low and very high levels of regular physical activity have been associated with degraded sleep quality. Cross‐national variations in habitual physical activity levels, therefore, may contribute to cross‐national differences in insomnia prevalence. The present study assesses and compares the extent to which weekly durations of moderate‐intensity physical activity contribute to insomnia risk. Demographic, sleep, physical activity and general health profiles were obtained from a convenience sample of 9,238 adults drawn from five countries (South Africa, Australia, China, South Korea and the UK) using social media. Insomnia prevalence, using DSM‐5 criteria, ranged from 4.1% (China) to 14.8% (UK). Evaluating risk using logistic regression adjusted only for age and gender, the lowest level of activity (&lt;10 continuous min per week) was associated with significant insomnia risk (odds ratio = 1.37; 95% confidence interval = 1.05–1.79; p &lt; 0.05). However, when adjusted for all covariates except country, only the highest level of physical activity (&gt;300 min per week) was associated with significantly increased insomnia risk (odds ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval = 1.03–2.51; p &lt; 0.05). Risk associated with high activity remained after the addition of “country” to the model (odds ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.02–1.69; p &lt; 0.05). Across all models, female gender, low‐rated health, low education and older age consistently increased insomnia risk. These cross‐national data indicate that extremes of inactivity/activity can significantly influence insomnia risk independent of country. Insomnia risk associated with very low levels of activity may be mediated by poorer health and disadvantageous social status. However, while very high levels of activity increase insomnia risk independent of health and demographic factors, they may also confound with personally and occupationally demanding lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "Background: Lifestyle behaviours, such as dietary patterns, sleep quality, perceived stress, and physical activity, are closely interconnected and play a critical role in maintaining health and well-being. Among school teachers, a profession marked by high psychosocial demands, the interplay between these factors warrants further exploration. Objective: This pilot study aimed to explore the associations between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD), sleep quality, perceived stress, and physical activity levels among Portuguese primary and secondary school teachers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and December 2023. Participants completed validated self-reported instruments, including the MD Adherence Screener (MEDAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). Correlational analyses and multivariable linear regression models were applied to explore the relationships among the variables. Results: Among the 50 teachers, 32% demonstrated high adherence to the MD, 60% reported good sleep quality, 62% experienced moderate stress, and 44% engaged in high physical activity. Women were more likely to adhere strongly to the MD (p = 0.012). Higher MD adherence was positively associated with physical activity (ρ = 0.343; p = 0.015). A positive correlation was observed between perceived stress and poorer sleep quality (ρ = 0.346, p = 0.014), and a negative correlation between perceived stress and physical activity levels (ρ = −0.297, p = 0.036). Despite reporting good sleep quality, these participants had higher perceived stress scores (p = 0.015). In adjusted models, sleep quality was the only significant predictor of perceived stress (B = 0.708; p = 0.003), and vice versa (B = 0.267; p = 0.003), suggesting a bidirectional relationship. Conclusions: The findings highlight the interrelation between dietary pattern, sleep stress, and physical activity in a professional group vulnerable to lifestyle-related health challenges. Although the sample size limits generalisability, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the need for integrated health promotion strategies targeting stress reduction and lifestyle optimisation among educators.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and treatment of cancer are associated with impairment at the physical and at psychological level. In addition, side effects are a potentially treatment-limiting factor that may necessitate dose reduction, delay, or even discontinuation of therapy, with negative consequences for outcome and mean survival. Numerous studies have shown that physical activity and sports and exercise therapy programs are not only practicable but also recommendable for oncologic patients during the acute phase and in the aftercare. Furthermore, nutrition plays an important role in all stages of tumor therapy. A timely integration of a nutrition therapy and physical activity in the form of physiotherapy and sports therapy serves to prevent and reduce treatment-associated side effects. Evidence-based recommendations on cancer prevention through nutrition therapy, physical activity, and sports and exercise therapy should be integrated into treatment plans for oncology patients as well as in health care services for the general population. Individual counselling by trained nutrition and exercise specialists may be advisable to receive concrete recommendations on the respective tumor entity or specific side effects. This mini review is based on a selective literature search in the PubMed database and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on the subjects of healthy diet and physical activity in primary prevention and follow-up about cancer.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Evidence supports the view that reductions in cognitive hyperarousal contribute substantially to improved sleep outcomes following cognitive and behavioral interventions for insomnia disorder. Assuming an inverted-u relationship between arousal and performance, a theoretical possibility, supported by limited empirical data, is that the same mediating processes could negatively impact aspects of psychomotor performance, reducing speed on tests of reaction time. Participants: Sedentary participants (mean age&#xa0;=&#xa0;59.8; SD&#xa0;=&#xa0;9.46) meeting research diagnostic criteria for insomnia were randomized to either an exercise intervention of &#x2265;150&#xa0;min of moderate-intensity activity per week (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;20), or a wait-list control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;21). Of these, n =&#xa0;17 intervention and n =&#xa0;18 control participants completed 6-month follow-up assessments. Methods: Digit span, and simple and complex vigilance task performance was assessed using a computerized protocol at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Dependent variables included digit span, simple reaction time (SRT), complex reaction time (CRT), false positive responses, number of lapses, and SRT/CRT ratio (indicative of the magnitude of difference between simple and complex RT performance). The primary clinical outcome was Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Results: In comparisons of baseline to follow-up change, ISI scores showed clinically significant improvement in the intervention group at 6-month follow-up (F (8,26)&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.16; P =&#xa0;0.03). Baseline vigilance performance was equivalent in both groups. At 6-month follow-up, however, the intervention group showed significantly slower simple reaction time F(4,30)&#xa0;=&#xa0;10.25, p <&#xa0;0.01, and a significantly decreased SRT/CRT ratio (F(4,30)&#xa0;=&#xa0;13.22, p <&#xa0;0.01). Conclusions: Among people meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia, beneficial sleep outcomes following successful behavioral interventions may, under some circumstances, come at the cost of slower psychomotor performance.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy living behaviors and the double workload of female teachers have led to lifestyle changes that have an impact on the risk of obesity. This study aimed to determine the influence of diet, physical activity, and sleep habits on the risk of obesity among female teachers in Lhokseumawe City. This cross-sectional design research was conducted in Lhokseumawe City from November 2023 to April 2024 on 289 female teachers using multistage random sampling. Eating patterns were measured using a semi-FFQ questionnaire, physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), sleeping patterns using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and body mass index (BMI) using anthropometric measurements. Bivariate analysis uses the chi-square test and multivariate analysis with multiple logistic regression. The results show, Physical activity (p=0.023, RP=2.295) and fat intake (p=0.007, RP=0.484) influenced the incidence of obesity, whereas carbohydrate intake (p=0.622), energy (0.524), protein (0.225), type of food (0.066), and sleep patterns (0.138) did not affect the incidence of obesity among female teachers in Lhokseumawe City. Conclusion: Physical activity is a dominant risk factor for obesity. The risk of obesity was 2.295 times greater for female teachers who were not physically active.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] Humans show near-24-h physiological and behavioral rhythms, which encompass the daily cycle of sleep and wakefulness. Exercise stimulates circadian rhythms, including those of cortisol, melatonin, and core body temperature, and affects sleep quality. We systematically reviewed studies that examined the effects of exercise intensity and timing on physiological circadian rhythms and sleep quality.[Methods] In this systematic review, we used the online databases PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Embase. This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent and experienced systematic reviewers performed the search and selected relevant studies. The participant, intervention, comparison, and outcome characteristics were: (1) adults; (2) exercise treatment; (3) no exercise treatment or different types of exercise (pre-exercise baseline); (4) cortisol, melatonin, or core body temperature measurement, and subjective or objective sleep quality assessments.[Results] We identified 9 relevant articles involving 201 participants (77.1% of whom were male). Our review revealed that short-term evening exercise delayed melatonin rhythm and increased nocturnal core body temperature; however, no negative effects on non-rapid eye movement sleep and sleep efficiency were observed. Moreover, no differences in sleep quality were observed between acute high-intensity and moderate-intensity exercises. With long exercise durations, the core body temperature tended to increase and return to baseline levels at 30–120 min.[Conclusion] Our review showed that short-term evening exercise and high-intensity exercise did not have a significant negative effect on sleep quality but physiological circadian rhythm tended to alter. Longterm morning exercise tended to decrease cortisol concentrations after awakening and improve sleep quality. Future studies should examine the effects of long-term exercise timing and intensity on circadian rhythm and sleep.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] Disruption of circadian genes affects metabolic homeostasis. Regular exercise programs prevent metabolic dysfunction and alter circadian gene expression In this study, we investigated whether exercise affects light stress-induced circadian rhythm derangement and metabolic resistance.[Methods] A circadian rhythm derangement mouse model was designed by extending the light exposure by two hours (14 L/10 D) for three weeks. Nine-weekold male mice were single-caged and divided into four groups: sedentary groups with or without light stress, and voluntary wheel-trained groups with or without light stress. In addition, differentiated myotubes were cultured in the presence of dexamethasone with or without 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR). The comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system was used to analyze the metabolic changes in mice. Moreover, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify the mRNA expression levels of circadian genes in animal and cell culture models.[Results] Three weeks of light stress reduced the running distance and increased the weight of mice. In addition, VO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consumption and heat production were increased during the night cycle under non-stress conditions but not under stress conditions. PCR analysis revealed that exercise and stress altered the expression levels of circadian genes in the hypothalamus and quadriceps muscles. mRNA expression levels of period circadian regulator 1 were downregulated in the quadriceps muscles of the stressed sedentary group compared to that in muscles of the non-stressed sedentary group. Furthermore, differentiated myotube cells cultured in the presence of dexamethasone, with or without AICAR, showed distinct oscillation patterns at various time points.[Conclusion] Our study demonstrates that exercise partially prevents metabolic disruption by regulating the circadian gene expression in skeletal muscles.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor thirty years ago, it has been shown that it regulates more than 250 genes involved in a multitude of biological processes, including redox balance, mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism, detoxification, cytoprotection, inflammation, immunity, autophagy, cell differentiation, and xenobiotic metabolism. In skeletal muscle, Nrf2 signalling is primarily activated in response to perturbation of redox balance by reactive oxygen species or electrophiles. Initial investigations into human skeletal muscle Nrf2 responses to exercise, dating back roughly a decade, have consistently indicated that exercise-induced ROS production stimulates Nrf2 signalling. Notably, recent studies employing Nrf2 knockout mice have revealed impaired skeletal muscle contractile function characterised by reduced force output and increased fatigue susceptibility compared to wild-type counterparts. These deficiencies partially stem from diminished basal mitochondrial respiratory capacity and an impaired capacity to upregulate specific mitochondrial proteins in response to training, findings corroborated by inducible muscle-specific Nrf2 knockout models. In humans, baseline Nrf2 expression in skeletal muscle correlates with maximal oxygen uptake and high-intensity exercise performance. This manuscript delves into the mechanisms underpinning Nrf2 signalling in response to acute exercise in human skeletal muscle, highlighting the involvement of ROS, antioxidants and Keap1/Nrf2 signalling in exercise performance. Furthermore, it explores Nrf2's role in mediating adaptations to chronic exercise and its impact on overall exercise performance. Additionally, the influence of diet and certain supplements on basal Nrf2 expression and its role in modulating acute and chronic exercise responses are briefly addressed.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Spinal sarcopenia is a multifactorial disorder associated with atrophy and fatty changes in paraspinal muscles. Interventional studies for spinal sarcopenia are limited. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined exercise and nutrition intervention for the treatment of spinal sarcopenia. Methods: 35 community-dwelling older women diagnosed with spinal sarcopenia in a previous cohort study were included. The 12-week combined intervention consisted of back extensor strengthening exercises and protein supplementation. The following outcomes were measured at baseline (week 0), after the intervention (week 12), and follow-up (week 24): conventional variables of sarcopenia (appendicular skeletal muscle mass, handgrip strength, 6-meter gait speed, and short physical performance battery); lumbar extensor muscle mass; lumbar extensor muscle volume and signal intensity; back extensor isokinetic strength; and back performance scale. We used the intention-to-treat analysis method, and repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Results: Of the total 35 potential participants, 26 older women participated in the study (mean age 72.5 ± 4.0 years old). After 12 weeks of combined exercise and nutrition intervention, there were no changes in the appendicular skeletal muscle mass, lumbar extensor muscle mass, volume, or signal intensity. Handgrip strength and back extensor isokinetic strength did not change significantly. Short physical performance battery significantly increased (P = 0.042) from 11.46 ± 0.86 to 11.77 ± 0.53 at week 12 and 11.82 ± 0.40 at week 24. The back performance scale sum score also significantly improved (P = 0.034) from 2.68 ± 1.81 to 1.95 ± 1.21 at week 12 and 2.09 ± 1.34 at week 24.",

Physical activity has been associated with good sleep while sedentary behavior has been associated with poor sleep. This study investigated whether physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with insomnia symptoms both generally (i.e., between-persons, mean-level) and dynamically (i.e., within-persons, person-centered).\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Participants (N=775) included adults (Mage=47.3 years,54.6% female) who completed an online longitudinal study investigating sleep and health across the lifespan at three time points (approximately 17-weeks apart). Participants reported: (a) their duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week (in minutes), (b) the percentage of their day spent sedentary, and (c) their insomnia symptoms via the Insomnia Severity Index which was scored according to traditional standards (i.e., total score) as well as proposed two factor scores: (1) Sleep Disturbance (items 1,2,3) and (2) Daytime Dysfunction (items 4,5,6,7).

For the Sleep Disturbance factor, between-person sedentary behavior was not a significant predictor while within-person sedentary behavior was associated with higher sleep disturbance scores (β=0.01, t=1.16, p=.245; β=.01, t=2.06, p=.039, respectively).

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               \n                  Introduction\n                  Insomnia and depression are highly comorbid and have been shown to be independently associated with lower levels of physical activity. It is not clear, however, if being less physically active is a risk factor for or consequence of depression and insomnia. The factors that explain the associations between insomnia, depression, and physical activity are likely complex and overlapping. For example, insomnia may predict inactivity by impacting one’s energy levels, leaving them too tired to exercise. Insomnia may also interfere with one’s motivation to exercise due to low mood, as insomnia is associated with the development of depressive symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to explore whether depression mediated the link between insomnia and low levels of physical activity.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  A national online survey was conducted from April-June 2020. Participants completed surveys to assess demographics, mood, sleep, and physical activity. Depressive symptoms were estimated with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Insomnia symptoms were estimated with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Physical activity levels were estimated with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Analyses were conducted using multiple linear regression, with separate models for depression, insomnia, and the combination of the two, on levels of physical activity.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  3,952 adults (Mage = 46.9 years) completed the survey. According to the unadjusted models, greater insomnia symptoms were associated with greater depressive symptoms (b = 0.4523, SE = 0.019593, p &amp;lt; .001), and lower levels of physical activity (b = -38.741, SE = 18.236, p = 0.0337). The relationship between insomnia and physical activity was no longer significant, however, when controlling for depression (b = -6.140, SE = 19.274, p = 0.75). According to the mediation analyses, there was an indirect effect of insomnia on physical activity that was explained by differences in depressive symptoms (Sobel Test = -4.895, SE = 6.518, p &amp;lt; .001).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Our findings support previous research indicating associations between symptoms of insomnia and depression and physical activity. Future research should examine if these same results hold using a longitudinal design.\n               \n               \n                  Support (if any)\n                  Vargas: K23HL141581",

Obesity was induced using a high-fat diet (45% fat) for five weeks. This investigation analyzed how the change of diet composition for eight weeks and long-term exercise training affected the expression of mRNA in epididymal white adipose tissue. For the experiment, 56 four-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used. Their epididymal white adipose tissue was extracted and used in RT-PCR analysis to find the expression level of mRNA. A high-fat diet for 13 weeks showed a significant increase in the expression of MCP-1, HIF-1&#x3b1;, NOX2, and ERK1 mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue. Change in diet composition and exercise decreased the expression of MCP-1, HIF-1&#x3b1;, NOX2, and ERK1 mRNA. Particularly, the group combining a high-fat diet and exercise had a significant increase in the expression of Mn-SOD mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue; however, it showed a significant decrease in MCP-1, HIF-1&#x3b1;, and NOX2. These results suggest that the antioxidant effect and weight loss by exercise decreased inflammation and oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Sleep reactivity is a predisposition to sleep disturbance during environmental perturbations, pharmacological challenges, or stressful life events. Consequently, individuals with highly reactive sleep systems are prone to insomnia disorder after a stressor, engendering risk of psychopathology and potentially impeding recovery from traumatic stress. Thus, there is tremendous value in ameliorating sleep reactivity to foster a sleep system that is robust to stress exposure, ultimately preventing insomnia and its downstream consequences. We reviewed prospective evidence for&#xa0;sleep reactivity as a predisposition to insomnia since our last review on the topic in 2017. We also reviewed studies investigating pre-trauma sleep reactivity as a predictor of adverse post-traumatic sequelae, and clinical trials that reported the effect of behavioural treatments for insomnia on mitigating sleep reactivity. Most studies measured sleep reactivity via self-report using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), demonstrating high scores on this scale reliably indicate a sleep system with a lower capacity to tolerate stress. Nascent evidence suggests elevated sleep reactivity prior to trauma increases the risk of negative posttraumatic outcomes, namely acute stress disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Lastly, sleep reactivity appears most responsive to behavioural insomnia interventions when delivered early during the acute phase of insomnia. Overall, the literature strongly supports sleep reactivity as a premorbid vulnerability to incident acute insomnia disorder when faced with an array of biopsychosocial stressors. The FIRST identifies individuals at risk of insomnia a priori, thereby guiding early interventions toward this vulnerable population to prevent insomnia and promote resilience to adversity.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePrevious studies have demonstrated that engaging in physical activity is a vital behavioral element in mitigating experiences of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, the specific mechanisms by which dietary practices and physical activity interact to affect these psychological conditions are not fully understood. Thus, this study aimed to comprehensively examine the relationships between physical activity, diet, and mental health outcomes, specifically depression, anxiety, and stress, among college students and to elucidate the pathways through which these factors interact.MethodThis study analyzed 1,076 college students (18.8 ± 0.8 years old) via the Adult Dietary Behavior Questionnaire (covering eight dimensions), the physical activity scale, and the depression-anxiety-stress scale.ResultsThere were significant differences in dietary behavior and physical activity parameters between male and female college students; however, no significant differences were observed in levels of depression, anxiety, or stress. The dimensions of college students' dietary behavior were significantly correlated with symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Higher levels of physical activity were negatively correlated with anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms in college-aged students (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Dietary behavior was significantly correlated with college students' physical activity. Through structural equation modeling analysis, our findings revealed that physical activity not only directly reduced depression, stress, and anxiety among college students but also indirectly alleviated them by improving their dietary behaviors. The direct effects of physical activity on depression, anxiety, and stress in college students were greater than the mediating effects of dietary behavior.ConclusionRegular physical activity plays a key role in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress among college students, with dietary behavior serving as a mediating factor. Therefore, promoting exercise and healthy eating within university settings is recommended for better mental health. Future research should investigate this relationship across diverse populations to gain valuable insights into mental health interventions.",

A two‐armed parallel randomized controlled trial (N=41; 30 females) was designed to assess whether increasing physical activity to the level recommended in public health guidelines can improve sleep quality among inactive adults meeting research diagnostic criteria for insomnia. The intervention consisted of a monitored program of ≥150 min of moderate‐ to vigorous‐intensity physical activity per week, for 6 months. The principal end‐point was the Insomnia Severity Index at 6 months post‐baseline. Secondary outcomes included measures of mood, fatigue and daytime sleepiness. Activity and light exposure were monitored throughout the trial using accelerometry and actigraphy. At 6 months post‐baseline, the physical activity group showed significantly reduced insomnia symptom severity (F8,26 = 5.16, P = 0.03), with an average reduction of four points on the Insomnia Severity Index; and significantly reduced depression and anxiety scores (F6,28 = 5.61, P = 0.02; and F6,28 = 4.41, P = 0.05, respectively). All of the changes were independent of daily light exposure. Daytime fatigue showed no significant effect of the intervention (F8,26 = 1.84, P = 0.18). Adherence and retention were high. Internationally recommended minimum levels of physical activity improve daytime and night‐time symptoms of chronic insomnia independent of daily light exposure levels.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to investigate if physical activity has a beneficial impact on insomnia. A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed database using the terms \"Physical activity\" and \"Insomnia\" and 591 records were retrieved. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were followed and fifteen articles were considered eligible for further analysis. Participants were mainly female, between 40 and 60 years; design studies were variable and most studies involved long-term interventions; insomnia definition was mainly based on diagnostic criteria or considered a specific cut-off point of well-known insomnia questionnaires; sleep was mostly assessed with polysomnography (PSG) or actigraphy; physical activity interventions included different methodologies (predominantly treadmill exercise). A beneficial effect of physical activity on insomnia was observed in most studies when sleep was evaluated with PSG or actigraphy. Sleep efficiency was the objective sleep parameter that mainly provided statistically significant results, as expected, followed by sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and, less frequently, total sleep time. Using objective methods to assess sleep in insomnia might be useful to support subjective insomnia complaints and to evaluate the efficacy of physical activity interventions in ameliorating sleep of people with insomnia.",

    "abstract": "Until recently nutrition and various other lifestyle factors were predominantly in the focus of medical disciplines like cardiology, endocrinology or gastroenterology. As mental disorders are multifactorial diseases and as such are complex, emerging evidence suggests that nutrition, exercise and sleep also play an important role in the aetiology, progression and treatment of mental disorders. In this regard research has mostly focused on depression and anxiety, but there is also evidence for other mental disorders like schizophrenia or autism. Some details concerning the relationship between diet and sleep on neuro-transmitter processes, immune-inflammatory pathways or oxidative stress will be demonstrated.Modifications of life style factors and diet are increasingly recognized as potential therapeutic options. Mostly used are nutrient-based supplements and essential elements in combination. But also healthy diet patterns with a high intake of vegetable, fruits and fish have proven beneficial in the treatment. If we better understand the microbiota-gut-brain axis and its impact on behavior, mood and cognitive processes, diet and lifestyle factors can not only contribute to the treatment but also to the prevention of mental disorders.Disclosure of interestThe author has not supplied his declaration of competing interest.",

    "abstract": "[Purpose] Circadian clocks are evolved endogenous biological systems that communicate with environmental cues to optimize physiological processes, such as the sleep-wake cycle, which is nearly related to quality of life. Sleep disorders can be treated using pharmacological strategies targeting melatonin, orexin, or core clock genes. Exercise has been widely explored as a behavioral treatment because it challenges homeostasis in the human body and affects the regulation of core clock genes. Exercise intervention at the appropriate time of the day can induce a phase shift in internal clocks. Although exercise is a strong external time cue for resetting the circadian clock, exercise therapy for sleep disorders remains poorly understood.[Methods] This review focused on exercise as a potential treatment for sleep disorders by tuning the internal circadian clock. We used scientific paper depositories, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library, to identify previous studies that investigated the effects of exercise on circadian clocks and sleep disorders.[Results] The exercise-induced adjustment of the circadian clock phase depended on exercise timing and individual chronotypes. Adjustment of circadian clocks through scheduled morning exercises can be appropriately prescribed for individuals with delayed sleep phase disorders. Individuals with advanced sleep phase disorders can synchronize their internal clocks with their living environment by performing evening exercises. Exercise-induced physiological responses are affected by age, sex, and current fitness conditions.[Conclusion] Personalized approaches are necessary when implementing exercise interventions for sleep disorders.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHigher levels of oxidative stress, as measured by F2-isoprostanes, have been associated with chronic diseases such as CVD and some cancers. Improvements in diet and physical activity may help reduce oxidative stress; however, previous studies regarding associations between lifestyle factors and F2-isoprostane concentrations have been inconsistent. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether physical activity and intakes of fruits/vegetables, antioxidant nutrients, dietary fat subgroups and alcohol are associated with concentrations of F2-isoprostane and the major F2-isoprostane metabolite. Urinary F2-isoprostane and its metabolite were measured in urine samples collected at enrolment from 912 premenopausal women (aged 35–54 years) participating in the Sister Study. Physical activity, alcohol consumption and dietary intakes were self-reported via questionnaires. With adjustment for potential confounders, the geometric means of F2-isoprostane and its metabolite were calculated according to quartiles of dietary intakes, alcohol consumption and physical activity, and linear regression models were used to evaluate trends. Significant inverse associations were found between F2-isoprostane and/or its metabolite and physical activity, vegetables, fruits, vitamin C, α-carotene, vitamin E, β-carotene, vitamin A, Se, lutein+zeaxanthin and long-chain n-3 fatty acids. Although trans fats were positively associated with both F2-isoprostane and its metabolite, other dietary fat subgroups including SFA, n-6 fatty acids, n-3 fatty acids, MUFA, PUFA, short-chain n-3 fatty acids, long-chain n-3 fatty acids and total fat were not associated with either F2-isoprostane or its metabolite. Our findings suggest that lower intake of antioxidant nutrients and higher intake of trans fats may be associated with greater oxidative stress among premenopausal women.",

Individuals with poor sleep quality are at particular risk of reporting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life, along with substance abuse. The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of combined physical activity and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on anxiety and depressive symptoms and insomnia severity among individuals with poor sleep quality.Methods Participants were 60 males and females with mean age (standard deviation) of 39.29 (5.82) years. Participants were randomly divided into 4 groups of 1) physical activity, 2) ACT, 3) combination of physical activity and ACT, and 4) control. The study consisted of four stages: pre-test, interventions, post-test, and follow-up. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to assess time by group interactions.Results The results showed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression and sleep problems were reduced for the physical activity, ACT, and combined groups, compared to the control group (p = 0.001). Superiority in all outcomes of the combined group was shown, compared to the other groups.Conclusions The present findings suggest that among individuals with poor sleep quality, combined physical activity and ACT intervention has the potential to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and insomnia severity. It further appears that health organizers should pay more attention to physical activity interventions in individuals with poor sleep quality.",

    "abstract": "Background: The escalating prevalence of obesity underscores the urgent need for effective and scalable interventions. Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled technologies have emerged as promising strategies to promote physical activity (PA) and address obesity. However, the comparative effectiveness of GPS-enabled PA interventions integrated with dietary components versus PA interventions alone remained unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of GPS-enabled PA interventions, with or without dietary strategies, in improving obesity-related outcomes among adults. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and April 2025 were retrieved from five databases. Eligible studies included GPS-enabled PA interventions targeting adults (&#x2265;18 years old), and reported at least one primary obesity-related outcome. Meta-analyses were performed using random- or fixed-effects models, depending on heterogeneity levels, and subgroup analyses explored effect modifiers. Results: Nine studies (involving 1363 participants, 424 males and 939 females, aged from 34.5-64.8) were included. GPS-enabled PA interventions significantly reduced body weight (Hedges' g = -0.241, 95% CI: -0.356 to -0.127, I2 = 6.5%, Q = 7.49, p = 0.380) and body fat percentage (BFP) (Hedges' g = -0.412, 95% CI: -0.804 to -0.020, I2 = 76.0%, Q = 16.66, p = 0.002). Subgroup analyses revealed that interventions involving PA alone produced a moderate effect on weight reduction (Hedges' g = -0.328; 95% CI: -0.616 to -0.039), whereas those combining PA with dietary strategies showed a slightly smaller yet significant effect (Hedges' g = -0.208; 95% CI: -0.372 to -0.044). Short-term interventions (&#x2264;3 months) demonstrated greater effects on weight reduction. Sensitivity and bias assessments supported the robustness of short-term outcomes. Conclusions: GPS-enabled PA interventions were effective for promoting short-term reductions in body weight and BFP.

These findings highlight the utility of geospatial technology in enhancing behavioral interventions and support the development of scalable digital health strategies aligned with public health priorities such as \"Healthy China 2030\".",

    "abstract": "The study involved 138 women aged 45-60 years in perimenopause (n=55) and postmenopause (n=83) with insomnia (main groups) and without it (control). The levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity were determined in erythrocytes; activities of glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were measured in blood serum. The differences with the control groups were found only in perimenopause: higher glutathione reductase activity and reduced GSSG level and GSH/GSSG ratio in women with insomnia (p<0.05). The results of the comparative analysis between the main groups showed lower glutathione reductase activity, increased GSSG level, and a decrease the GSH/GSSG ratio in the postmenopausal period compared with the perimenopause (p<0.05). These results can be used in choosing the tactics for complex therapy of insomnia in menopausal women to correct free radical homeostasis and prevention of oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n                Background\n                Despite the growing interest in the relation between adiposity in children and different lifestyle clusters, few studies used a longitudinal design to examine a large range of behaviors in various contexts, in particular eating- and sleep-related routines, and few studies have examined these factors in young children. The objectives of this study were to identify clusters of boys and girls based on diet, sleep and activity-related behaviors and their family environment at 2 and 5 years of age, and to assess whether the clusters identified varied across maternal education levels and were associated with body fat at age 5.\n              \n                Methods\n                At 2 and 5 years, respectively, 1436 and 1195 parents from the EDEN mother-child cohort completed a questionnaire including behavioral data. A latent class analysis aimed to uncover gender-specific behavioral clusters. Body fat percentage was estimated by anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements. Association between cluster membership and body fat was assessed with mutivariable linear regression models.\n              \n                Results\n                At 2 years, two clusters emerged that were essentially characterized by opposite eating habits. At 5 years, TV exposure was the most distinguishing feature, but the numbers and types of clusters differed by gender. An association between cluster membership and body fat was found only in girls at 5 years of age, with girls in the cluster defined by very high TV exposure and unfavorable mealtime habits (despite high outdoor playing and walking time) having the highest body fat. Girls whose mother had low educational attainment were more likely to be in this high-risk cluster. Girls who were on a cluster evolution path corresponding to the highest TV viewing time and the least favorable mealtime habits from 2 to 5 years of age had higher body fat at 5 years.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Efforts to decrease TV time and improve mealtime routines may hold promise for preventing overweight in young children, especially girls growing up in disadvantaged families. These preventive efforts should start as early in life as possible, ideally before the age of two, and should be sustained over the preschool years.",

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) on subjective sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and quantitative EEG biomarkers in chronic insomnia.&#xa0;Thirty adults with chronic insomnia (DSM-5 criteria) were randomized to receive active tPBM (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) or sham treatment (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). Active tPBM (810&#xa0;nm wavelength; 250mW/cm&#xb2; irradiance; 60&#xa0;J/cm&#xb2; energy density) was applied to frontal cortical regions for 10&#xa0;min per session over 3 consecutive days. Primary outcomes were Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and absolute delta power (1-4&#xa0;Hz) at frontal EEG sites, assessed at baseline and 1-week post-treatment.&#xa0;Significant improvements were observed in the tPBM group compared to sham: PSQI global score (mean difference: -4.6 points; 95% CI: -7.2 to -2.0; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004, &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.272), ESS total score (mean difference: -4.1 points; 95% CI: -6.8 to -1.4; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.015, &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.209), and absolute delta power at multiple frontal sites (e.g., Fp1: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.418; Fz: p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001, &#x3b7;&#xb2;=0.450). No serious adverse events occurred.&#xa0;Three sessions of frontal tPBM (810&#xa0;nm, 60&#xa0;J/cm&#xb2;) significantly improved subjective sleep quality, reduced daytime sleepiness, and normalized pathological wake frontal delta activity in chronic insomnia. These findings support tPBM as a promising, safe neuromodulatory intervention targeting thalamocortical dysrhythmia. Larger trials with longer follow-up are warranted.",

A review of related literature was performed to examine interpersonal communication, interpersonal communication skills, interpersonal communication and a proactive stance in conflict resolution, and the development of communication skills in children in a puzzled world. The study noted that children should be allowed and guided appropriately to express themselves clearly and assertively; parents should follow up on their children regularly and should build on teachers' efforts at home. Parents should also allow teachers to do their job of teaching, counselling, and rewarding positively (praise, commend) or negatively (punish) based on the circumstances; teachers should use a child-centered approach in order to make the class lively, interesting, and engaging for children. In addition, they should show empathy and try to be close to the children as much as possible to curb the actions of the loquacious ones and help the shy or withdrawn children to come out of their shells as they prepare for the task ahead in a challenging but essential milieu as they mature and are integrated into the system. The government should implement better incentives and policies to encourage teachers to contribute to the growth and positive development of the child through remuneration and promotion that are timely and in line with their quota.",

The gratitude youth feel after different types of bystander action may depend on which behaviors are most congruent with personal beliefs. Face and honor cultures provide social norms for expectations and interpretations of behavior, including how to act during and after interpersonal conflict. In the current study, 264 ethnically diverse adolescents (African, European, Mexican-American, and Indigenous) from the Pacific Northwest described past instances when they experienced an act of peer-instigated aggression and subsequent bystander action. We examined how face and honor endorsements predicted victims' gratitude following three different types of bystander action (calm, avenge, and reconcile). Face endorsement predicted higher gratitude for being calmed, whereas honor endorsement predicted higher gratitude for being avenged. Bystander efforts to reconcile conflict elicited the most gratitude but were not related to social norm endorsement. Our findings shed light on the association between social norm endorsement and victimized youths' gratitude for their intervening peers' bystander actions.",

To test this model, the authors administered the Parent-Child Interaction Scale, the Gratitude Scale, and the Prosocial Behavior Scale, which have good validity and reliability, to a total of 987 fifth- and sixth-grade students in Kaohsiung. In regard of gender, there were 521 males, occupying 52.8%; 466 females, occupying 47.2%. In respect with grade level, there were 482 grade-5 students, occupying 48.8%; 505 grade-6 students, occupying 51.2%. Based on an analysis of data using structural equation modeling (SEM), we reached the following conclusions: 1 There was a significant positive correlation between father-child and mother-child interactions; 2. There was a significant positive correlation between parent-child interaction, gratitude, and prosocial behavior; 3. Gratitude mediated the relationship between parent-child interaction and prosocial behavior.",

The study group of the research consisted of 324 4th grade primary school students studying in Diyarbakir province during the 2018-2019 academic year and designated through a random sampling method. &quot;Conflict Resolution Skills Scale,&quot; developed by Gurdogan Bayir, &quot;KA-SI Empathetic Tendency Scale for Children,&quot; developed by Kaya and Siyez and &quot;Respectful Behavior Scale&quot; developed by Erken were used as data collection tools in the research. The data obtained were analysed by Structural Equation Model and Bootstrap analysis. Findings: Within the framework of the findings obtained, predictably, it was found that there is a significant relationship between empathetic tendency and conflict resolution skills and that empathetic tendency can explain conflict resolution skills by 36%. As also suggested in the research hypotheses, in addition to the existence of a relationship between an empathetic tendency and conflict resolution skills through a model in which respectful behaviour is a significant partial mediator, empathetic tendency can explain conflict resolution skills at a level of 54%. Implications for Research and Practice: In future research, it should be investigated, which skill, value, or demographic information etc. other than empathetic tendency and respectful behaviour may help explain the baffling variance ratio.",

    "abstract": "Empathy plays a key role in maintaining close relationships and promoting prosocial conflict resolution. However, research has not addressed the potential emotional cost of adolescents' high empathy, particularly when relationships are characterized by more frequent conflict. The present 6-year longitudinal study (N = 467) investigated whether conflict with parents predicted emotion dysregulation more strongly for high-empathy adolescents than for lower-empathy adolescents. Emotion dysregulation was operationalized at both the experiential level, using mood diary data collected for 3 weeks each year, and at the dispositional level, using annual self-report measures. In line with predictions, we found that more frequent adolescent-parent conflict predicted greater day-to-day mood variability and dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation for high-empathy adolescents, but not for average- and low-empathy adolescents. Mood variability and difficulties in emotion regulation, in turn, also predicted increased conflict with parents. These links were not moderated by empathy. Moreover, our research allowed for a novel investigation of the interplay between experiential and dispositional emotion dysregulation. Day-to-day mood variability predicted increasing dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation over time, which suggests that experiential dysregulation becomes consolidated into dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that, for high-empathy adolescents, conflict was a driver of this dysregulation consolidation process. Finally, emotion dysregulation played a role in overtime conflict maintenance for high-empathy adolescents. This suggests that, through emotion dysregulation, high empathy may paradoxically also contribute to maintaining negative adolescent-parent interactions. Our research indicates that high empathy comes at a cost when adolescent-parent relationships are characterized by greater negativity.",

    "abstract": "Three experiments showed that gratitude positively affected preschool children's prosocial behavior. In the studies, the experimenter induced gratitude by giving a token gift and then making a request for help or to share resources. Experiment 1 (N = 126, 4- to 6-year-olds) showed that gratitude increased helping behaviors toward the benefactor, and that emphasis on the benefactor's intention had a significant effect on helping behaviors. Experiment 2 (N = 129, 4- to 6-year-olds) indicated that grateful emotions increased the likelihood that the children would help not only the benefactor but also a stranger. Experiment 3 (N = 133, 3- to 6-year-olds) showed that gratitude motivated preschoolers' sharing behavior with the benefactor. Children's theory-of-mind and their understanding of the benefactor's intention mediated the relationship between children's age, gratitude, and prosociality.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine empathic tendency, self-regulation abilities and self-efficacy perceptions in adolescents as predictors of conflict resolution skills. The sample of this study consists of 391 students from 9th and 10th classes of a high school in Kahramanmaras province. In the study, the Conflict Resolution Scale, KA-SI Empathic Tendency Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, and Self-regulation Scale were used as data collection tools. Multiple regression analysis was used for the analysis of the data. According to results of the study, it was found that empathic tendency levels, self-regulation skills and self-efficacy perceptions of adolescents predicted their conflict resolution skills significantly. When the relative importance order of the predictor variables on the conflict resolution skills is examined, it is seen that the empathy variable is the most efficient predicting variable followed by self-regulation and self-efficacy. Besides, it was concluded that empathy was in the mediator in the relationship between conflict resolution skills and self-efficacy.",

    "abstract": "In pedagogical practice, gratitude is recognised not as an emotion, but as an approach to learning. This study introduced gratitude messages into the academic online communication of university students and specifically examined the community in which students shared their messages with gratitude. This study examined the tendency of message connections and how gratitude messages prompted replies. To elucidate their connections, exponential random graph models (ERGMs) were used. A post-event questionnaire to evaluate gratitude experiences was also administered. Results revealed that 77.3% of the 172 connected messages from 123 students involved gratitude. When the post-event questionnaire results were examined using an ERGM, the score effects on increasing message connections were found not to be significant. The most prominent indication was a higher level of significant propensities to make mutual connections. The homophily of the message content was found to have a significant propensity to increase connections. The ERGM results and a review of messages revealed that students expressed gratitude for being both benefactors and beneficiaries of gratitude messages, which confirmed their prosocial behaviour.",

Children's capacity for this pattern of flexible RSA change was associated with their subjective empathic feelings, which were concurrently associated with more sympathetic and prosocial responses to others. Conversely, only children's dynamic RSA change longitudinally predicted prosocial behavior 2 years later. These findings have implications for understanding the dynamic and multifaceted nature of empathy, and its relation with prosocial development.",

However, these studies have neglected the possibility that online prosocial behavior (OPB) may serve as a mediator in the link between self-compassion and SWB. Based on the PERMA theory of well-being and the protective-protective model, the current study examined whether OPB would mediate the association between self-compassion and individual SWB, and whether gratitude would moderate the association between self-compassion and OPB. A valid sample of 1488 college students (M[subscript age] = 19.84; SD = 1.61) filled out questionnaires regarding demographics, self-compassion, OPB, gratitude, and SWB. Results showed that, after controlling for gender, age, daily online time, and social desirability, OPB mediated the association between self-compassion and individual SWB, and gratitude strengthened the positive association between self-compassion and OPB. These findings reveal that high self-compassionate and grateful people can enhance their subjective well-being through behaving prosocially online.",

Adolescents exposed to Cluster 1 (inconsistency and withdrawal) reported lower self-control than those exposed to Cluster 2 (inconsistency and dominance), who reported more ability to deal with stress, effective task performance, and positive self-concept and self-esteem, indicating that dominance at the school only was related to positive results. Lower perceived stress, positive self-concept and self-esteem, empathy, and social connectedness were reported by those adolescents exposed to Cluster 3 (consistency in negotiation), whereas those exposed to Cluster 4 (consistency in dominance) exhibited the worst profile in all the measures. In conclusion, the cross-contextual variability in conflict resolution styles was associated with different opportunities for positive development in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Elbow stiffness often hinders daily tasks. Open elbow arthrolysis is effective but requires long-term postoperative rehabilitation. Traditional health education does not significantly improve patient cooperation or results. Handy and engaging tools such as WeChat and scene graphics may help. This study aims to assess the efficacy of WeChat-based health education combined with scene graphics following open elbow arthrolysis. This historical control study involved patients aged 18 years and older who underwent open elbow arthrolysis, had normal communication skills, and were proficient in using WeChat. Eligible patients were divided into 2 groups based on admission time: the control group (56 patients, enrolled from January to June 2021) and the WeChat group (56 patients, enrolled from July to December 2021). The control group had received traditional health education, whereas the WeChat group received health education using WeChat and scene graphics. Information in 4-part comics was shared through a WeChat public account. Patients accessed this account to receive daily lessons during hospitalization, followed by online instruction in a WeChat group after discharge until 12 weeks postoperatively. Outcome data were collected at 1, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcome was elbow range of motion; secondary outcomes were elbow function, quality of life, and complication incidence. The elbow flexion angle improved from 71.5&#xb0; (SD 4.2&#xb0;) to 124.2&#xb0; (SD 11.7&#xb0;) in the WeChat group and from 71.7&#xb0; (SD 4.6&#xb0;) to 114.4&#xb0; (SD 13.6&#xb0;) in the control group (difference 10.0&#xb0;, 95% CI 4.9-15.1, P&lt;.001).

The mean forearm pronation angle improved from 31.9&#xb0; (SD 4.0&#xb0;) to 66.9&#xb0; (SD 7.3&#xb0;) in the WeChat group and from 33.0&#xb0; (SD 4.2&#xb0;) to 63.1&#xb0; (SD 7.2&#xb0;) in the control group (difference 4.9&#xb0;, 95% CI 2.0-7.8, P=.001). The mean forearm supination angle improved from 30.2&#xb0; (SD 3.7&#xb0;) to 71.8&#xb0; (SD 4.8&#xb0;) in the WeChat group and from 30.4&#xb0; (SD 4.1&#xb0;) to 64.2&#xb0; (SD 9.8&#xb0;) in the control group (difference 7.7&#xb0;, 95% CI 4.4-11.0, P&lt;.001).

    "abstract": "Foodborne listeriosis outbreaks occur occasionally in Australia and can lead to severe outcomes for at-risk populations. Outbreaks also have the potential to cause illness in a large number of people in a short period. We identified invasive listeriosis outbreaks investigated in Australia from 2012 to 2022. We summarised the key features of these outbreaks and assessed the implications for food safety and future outbreak investigations. Outbreak data were extracted from the national OzFoodNet Outbreak Register and described by year reported; size; severity; type of evidence; food implicated; setting in which the food was prepared and eaten; and likely cause of contamination. Twelve listeriosis outbreaks were identified. These outbreaks involved a total of 94 cases, with 20 deaths reported (an overall case fatality rate of 21.3%). The median number of cases per outbreak was three (range: 2-34) and the median number of deaths was one (range: 0-7). Except for one outbreak with a median age of 32 years, the median age per outbreak ranged within 62-92 years. The most common food type implicated was pre-prepared composite foods (25%), including frozen meals and sandwiches. Ten outbreak investigations (83.3%) identified microbiological evidence of the same aetiological agent in the cases and the suspected food vehicle, including using whole genome sequencing as an emerging laboratory method. Most outbreaks (ten outbreaks, 83.3%) were caused by contamination of the product in the production environment, with one outbreak associated with extreme weather events. Use of novel microbiologic techniques has increased listeriosis outbreak detection and has also improved the ability to identify causes of outbreaks. It is important that public health communication emphasises the risks of consuming high-risk ingredients in composite foods, not just as standalone products. Food safety protocols should undergo ongoing review to ensure they are responsive to a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Women with breast or gynecological cancer and their intimate partners often face sexual problems in their relationships. Accessing care for sexual health problems is challenging for several reasons (eg, limited trained health care providers and privacy concerns), making self-management approaches highly promising. This study assessed the feasibility of the Psychosexual Educational Partners Program (PEPP), a 6-week sexual health self-management intervention for women treated for breast or gynecological cancer and their intimate partners. A mixed methods single-arm, repeated measures design was used for this study. An attrition rate of &#x2264;25% was considered feasible. Intervention experiences were assessed via interviews, and preliminary effects on the Dyadic Sexual Communication Scale, relationship quality measured by the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and sexual health measured by PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction version 2.0 were explored quantitatively. In total, 7 (77%) of the 9 couples completed the study through week 6 and provided both pre- and poststudy data, resulting in an attrition rate of 22% (2/9), which met the feasibility benchmark for attrition of 25% or less. The following two themes emerged: (1) PEPP helped us start difficult conversations and impacted emotional and physical intimacy. The intervention adherence was 85%. Dyadic Sexual Communication Scale scores improved with a mean change score of 6.64 (SD 9.65) and a Cohen d of 0.69. Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale scores declined slightly, with a mean change score of -0.93 (SD 3.41) and a Cohen d of 0.27. PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction version 2.0 scores showed small improvements for women on desire, with a mean change score of 2.36 (SD 6.24) and a Cohen d of 0.38. Similarly, for women, the satisfaction mean change score was 2.20 (SD 8.22) and a Cohen d of 0.27. For intimate partners, a small effect was found for desire, but in this instance, desire decreased with a mean change score of -1.57 (SD 6.09) and a Cohen d of 0.26. The findings support PEPP as a feasible intervention for improving sexual communication. If proven effective in a randomized controlled trial, it has the potential to address the critical gap in supportive care among female cancer survivors.

Clinician well-being is crucial for sustaining positive interactions. Advancing the field requires evidence-based strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure effective, consistent communication in high-pressure settings and to bridge the gap between research and real-world clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Nursing ethics has long drawn on established frameworks such as principlism, care ethics, and relational approaches to guide practice. While these models provide valuable direction, they often overlook how the intentional structure of action shapes ethical meaning in clinical encounters. This article argues that Anscombe's philosophy, particularly her work on intention and action, offers the conceptual tools to enrich nursing ethics by grounding moral significance in action-guiding reasoning. Although her work has not been widely applied to nursing, it offers substantial potential to enhance ethical decision-making, patient-centered care, and holistic support. Drawing on her seminal text, Intention (1957), this paper examines Anscombe's concepts of intention, motives, and the distinction between intentional and non-intentional actions, as well as intentional omissions. These ideas provide a foundation for understanding intention as action-guiding reasoning rather than an internal mental state, an approach that deepens ethical reflection and promotes more intentional, virtuous nursing care. The paper also addresses Anscombe's rejection of the fact/value dichotomy, a distinction famously articulated by Hume (2022/1739), who argued that moral values cannot be derived from observable facts alone. Instead, Anscombe maintains that ethical meaning is embedded in the description of intentional action, a view that, when extended to nursing, offers a fresh perspective for clinical decision-making. Through applications to ethical dilemmas, communication, and holistic care, it Anscombe's philosophical perspective can enrich nursing and foster morally meaningful, intention-based practice that upholds both patient autonomy and professional integrity. This paper is organized into key sections addressing motives and action, intentional omissions, the fact/value distinction, clinical decision-making, communication, and holistic support.",

    "abstract": "Food allergies (FAs) can be life-threatening and represent a significant public health concern. The reported prevalence of FA in Japan is 7.6% in 1-year-olds, 6.7% in 2-year-olds, and 4.9% in 3-year-olds. In addition, avoiding allergenic foods, prompt identification, and response are required when symptoms appear. A food diary is a tool for daily dietary management, recording of symptoms, and communication between families of children with FA and health care providers. Conventionally, paper diaries (P-diaries) have been used. Recent technological advancements and the extensive use of smartphones have prompted the development of numerous electronic diaries (E-diaries). However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of E-diaries in Japan. This study aimed to assess the experiences of parents of preschool children with FA as they transitioned from P-diaries to E-diaries. For 6 months commencing in October 2020, during the period of movement restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recruited parents of preschool children diagnosed with FAs by an allergist at a single general hospital. This pilot study used a single-group pretest-posttest design to evaluate the feasibility of using an E-diary. To assess parents' views on transitioning to E-diaries from P-diaries, data were collected using semistructured interviews conducted after 6 months of E-diary use. Five parents took part in the study. The problems with P-diaries and the effects and outcomes of E-diaries from the perspective of parents of preschool children with FA were categorized into 52 codes, which were grouped into 19 subcategories and 6 categories. Parents of preschool children with FA reported the following issues: I. difficulties with using a P-diary; II. stress related to sharing information with doctors; III. difficulties in making disease management habitual as issues with P-diary use; IV. ease of using the E-diary as an effect of the transition; V. more efficient sharing of information with doctors; and VI. improved adherence as outcomes of E-diary use. E-diaries may resolve various issues associated with P-diaries and may be useful tools for communication between parents and physicians regarding disease management. Since the number of participants was small (ie, 5) and the study was conducted at a single facility, theoretical saturation was not reached. In the future, it will be necessary to increase the number of participants to validate these findings.",

Translational-rotational coupled errors (1.0&#xb0;rotation paired with 1.0&#x2005;mm translation, 2.0&#xb0; with 2.0&#x2005;mm, 3.0&#xb0; with 3.0&#x2005;mm) were simulated about all axes. The D95 (dose to 95% of the PTVboost) and V95 (volume covered by 95% of the prescribed dose) were assessed through multivariate analysis to explore the relationship between PTVboost coverage and various anatomy factors, including the volume of the PTVboost (V_boost), the distance from the PTVboost centroid to the isocentre (D_iso), the mean depth from the anterior edge of PTVboost to the body surface (S_Depth), and setup errors.ResultsUnder a combination of 1.0&#xb0; rotation and 1.0&#x2005;mm setup errors, the D95 values and V95 coverage of the PTVboost were &#x2265;95% in all cases. However, when the error combination increased to 2.0&#xb0;:2.0&#x2005;mm, there was a significant decrease in coverage, with approximately 80% of the target areas exhibiting D95 and V95 values &lt;95%. When the setup errors further increased to 3.0&#xb0;:3.0&#x2005;mm, D95 and V95 values were &lt;95% in all cases. Multivariate analysis indicated that V_boost, D_iso, and S_Depth were significant predictors of target coverage.ConclusionPTVboost dose coverage risk were synergistically influenced by increasing D_iso, reduced V_boost, and shorter S_Depth. The multivariate model may stratify coverage risk categories using tumor anatomy and setup error magnitudes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAlthough numerous studies have reported on the relationship between abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and schizophrenia (SZ), few have focused on aberrant lncRNAs as potential clinical biomarkers for diagnosing SZ and their association with psychiatric symptoms.MethodsTo investigate the diagnostic value of lncRNAs as specific biomarkers in the plasma of patients with SZ and to explore the relationship between the expression levels of aberrant lncRNAs and psychiatric symptoms, we examined the expression levels of ten significantly aberrant lncRNAs (ENST00000394742.3, TCONS_l2_00025502, NONHSAT098126, NONHSAT089447, ENST00000563823.2, NONHSAT021545, NONHSAT041499, ENST00000521622.1, TCONS_l2_00021339, NONHSAT1047781). The ten significantly aberrant lncRNAs were analyzed in plasma samples from 96 SZ patients and 48 healthy controls using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) were utilized to assess the psychiatric symptoms of the SZ patients.ResultsThe results demonstrated that a panel of lncRNAs consisting of NONHSAT089447, NONHSAT021545, and NONHSAT041499 exhibited significant upregulation and combined diagnostic value for SZ (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.689, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001; sensitivity: 77.1%, specificity: 58.3%). The plasma expression levels of these three abnormal lncRNAs were closely correlated with the Positive subscale score and the GAS total score (rSp: -0.401 to 0.311, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Notably, NONHSAT021545 accounted for 11.3% of the Positive subscale score and 11.6% of the GAS total score, respectively. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that NONHSAT021545 could significantly predict the severity of positive symptoms.ConclusionsThe combination of NONHSAT089447, NONHSAT021545, and NONHSAT041499 as a panel may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of SZ. Furthermore, these three abnormal lncRNAs, particularly NONHSAT021545, are likely implicated in the pathogenesis and development of the positive symptoms associated with SZ.",

Among all of the mechanisms, the supersaturated crystallization theory focuses on the microcrystal size of stones. However, there are few researches on the formation mechanism of stones in nanoscale. This narrative review summarizes the current mainstream mechanisms of kidney stone formation. It also discusses the relationship between calcium oxalate (CaOx) nanocrystals and the formation of kidney stones from the perspective of the physicochemical properties of the nanocrystals. To further explore the role of CaOx nanocrystals in the formation of CaOx, this review lists some convenient and reliable methods for tracking nanocrystals. Currently, in addition to mainstream treatments like potassium sodium hydrogen citrate and thiazide diuretics, some researches indicate that polysaccharide drugs, selenium nanoparticles, and dietary can inhibit the formation of nanocrystals, ultimately preventing the formation of CaOx stones.",

    "abstract": "The upper face is central to human nonverbal communication, with the glabellar complex, forehead, and lateral canthal area signaling core emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, surprise, and joy. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is widely used to modulate muscle activity in these regions, not only reducing dynamic wrinkles but also affecting emotional expression and perception. The aim of this narrative review is to synthesize psychological and neurobiological insights into a region-focused framework, helping clinicians incorporate emotional considerations into BoNT-A treatments of the upper face. A narrative literature review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus, combining the search terms \"botulinum toxin\", \"facial expression\", \"emotion\", \"mimicry\"&#xa0;and \"psychology\". Peer-reviewed articles addressing facial Action Units (AUs), neural mechanisms, or psychological outcomes were included. Citation tracking and the authors' clinical expertise further informed the synthesis. The upper face is integral to various facial expressions, with each region contributing distinct signals relevant to intrapersonal experience and interpersonal communication. BoNT-A can alter these facial expressions, with potential benefits such as mood enhancement, but also possible limitations in conveying authenticity. While neuroimaging and behavioral findings support links between facial feedback and limbic activity, systematic data on region-specific psychological outcomes remains scarce. Understanding baseline emotional functions of facial expressions is crucial for clinicians, as these movements shape intrapersonal experience and interpersonal communication. Integrating this knowledge into counseling enables transparent, well-informed discussions before BoNT-A application. Future research should systematically evaluate expressive flexibility and patient-reported satisfaction with emotional communication.",

To evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a community-based health-social partnership programme (C-HSPP) for community-dwelling older adults. This was a cluster randomised controlled hybrid type-2 design. Implementation outcomes included reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance. Self-efficacy served as the primary effectiveness measure. The 12-week C-HSPP intervention involved nurse assessments and interventions supported by social workers. Data were collected at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and follow-up (T3). Eight older adult centres were randomised into four matched pairs (intervention: 4, control: 4), with 755 older adults assigned to intervention (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;381) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;374) groups.Implementation evaluation revealed high programme reach amongst both providers and users, citing facilitators such as coordinated communication and structured protocols for the C-HSPP adoption. Key implementation challenges included the need for further role clarity within the interprofessional teams, varied degree of acceptability of home visits by users due to privacy concerns and logistic constraints, and the need for resource support for a health-social team to sustain the service. Significant group-time interaction effect was detected in self-efficacy at T3 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.928, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.035), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) at both T2 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.411, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.032) and T3 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.437, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.032), and reduced unplanned health service use at T2 (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.493, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.015), with better outcomes found in the intervention group. This study has provided a working framework to translate an evidence-based health-social partnership model in real-life settings, highlighting the essence of stakeholder engagement and interprofessional communication in aligning goals with service needs. Policy support for resource allocation is important to sustain the model in the community.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women worldwide, and recurrence rates stay high despite current treatments, especially for those with negative estrogen receptor status, where therapies are less effective, and prognosis is worse. Identifying molecules with predictive value for therapy response and prognosis is therefore crucial. In this context, FOXA1 could serve as a potential biomarker to predict the progression of ER-negative tumors. A search was conducted to answer the question, \"What is the prognostic value of FOXA1 expression in breast cancer, estrogen receptor negative?\" using various databases. Controlled vocabulary and Boolean operators were employed. Only studies reporting overall survival and disease-free survival, defined as the time from evaluation to death or relapse, were included. We identified seven articles evaluating FOXA1 and its relationship with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) in patients with ER-negative breast cancer. Our data indicate that higher FOXA1 expression is associated with improved overall survival (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.61, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45-0.83, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002) and better disease-free survival (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.69, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.51-0.93, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.02). These findings suggest that FOXA1 is linked to a favorable prognosis in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival. Further studies are needed to assess the role of FOXA1 in response to chemotherapy. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024453750.",

    "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (henceforth HIV) is a global health problem, presently with no known cure. Africa has one of the highest incidences of HIV. Nigeria, within the West African (WA) region, is one of the largest economies on the continent. However, the country continues to struggle with HIV, with approximately 2 million individuals currently infected and experiencing ongoing transmissions. Management of the disease has been difficult due to communication barriers between English-speaking medical practitioners and indigenous patients in rural and suburban regions of the country and bordering countries. In this paper, we used fuzzy logic and voice-enabled technology to create WAHMIDS (West African HIV and HIV-comorbidity Multilingual Indigenous Diagnostic Software) and WAHMIMA (West African HIV Multilingual Informatics Mobile Application), which are health apps designed to help diagnose HIV and manage related health issues in both rural and urban areas for people who speak different indigenous languages in West Africa. Additionally, illustrations of the application of this tool to HIV diagnosis, using existing HIV data, are demonstrated. We expect that these tools will assist English-speaking medical workers and inhabitants of West African communities in their efforts to control HIV transmissions. These informatics tools have the potential to help prescribe medications for HIV and HIV-comorbidity patients. We anticipate that these informatics tools will help address healthcare disparities and promote diversity, equality, and inclusion by reducing the gaps in healthcare delivery between different regions and facilitating the collection of diverse patient data, which is essential for developing and planning more inclusive and accurate healthcare strategies in the West African sub-region.",

    "abstract": "Inferential statistics traditionally used in clinical trials can miss relationships between clinical phenotypes and treatment responses. We simulated a randomised clinical trial to explore how gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning compares with traditional analysis when 'ground truth' treatment responsiveness depends on the interaction of multiple phenotypic variables. As expected, traditional analysis detected a significant treatment benefit (outcome measure change from baseline&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.23; 95% CI 3.64-4.82). However, recommending treatment based upon this evidence would lead to 56.3% of patients failing to respond. In contrast, machine learning correctly predicted treatment response in 97.8% (95% CI 96.6-99.1) of patients, with model interrogation showing the critical phenotypic variables and the values determining treatment response had been identified. Importantly, when a single variable was omitted, accuracy dropped to 69.4% (95% CI 65.3-73.4). This proof of principle underscores the significant potential of machine learning to maximise the insights derived from clinical research studies. However, the effectiveness of machine learning in this context is highly dependent on the comprehensive capture of phenotypic data.",

    "abstract": "Dandruff is a prevalent scalp condition characterized by flakiness and itchiness. Its severity can be assessed clinically based on the grade of flakes and coverage area of flakes adhering to the scalp. Dysbiosis of the scalp microbiome is a key factor associated with dandruff, as revealed by studies comparing healthy individuals with those with dandruff. This study further investigated the interplay between microbiome alterations and dandruff severity, and whether these changes are consistent across different sexes. Dandruff condition was assessed using the Total Weighted Head Score for Adherent Flakes (TWHS AF). Male and female participants with lower dandruff severity (TWHS AF = 32-40 inclusive) and higher dandruff severity (TWHS AF &#x2265; 44) were recruited following ethical clearance of the study and obtaining informed consent. Scalp bacterial composition was investigated by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The absolute abundance of key scalp microbes was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notable microbiome compositional differences were observed between scalps with lower and higher dandruff severity. More severe dandruff exhibited a significantly reduced abundance of Cutibacterium acnes and elevated levels of Staphylococcus capitis and Corynebacterium spp. The absolute numbers of Malassezia restricta significantly increased with increased dandruff severity, while M. globosa remained similar. Additionally, distinctive scalp microbial profiles were observed between female and male participants with dandruff, even with the same levels of severity. Interestingly, beta diversity analysis revealed that the microbiomes from male participants with less severe dandruff clustered closely with those of male and female participants with more severe dandruff. Similarly, microbiome metabolic pathway profiles indicated that metabolic alteration in male participants with less severe dandruff was more similar to male and female participants with more severe dandruff. Our findings underscored significant severity-associated variations in microbial ecology. For the first time, we unveiled sex-related differences in microbiome profiles among individuals with dandruff, with male profiles resembling a severe dandruff dysbiosis state. These results highlight a progressive development of microbiome dysbiosis with dandruff severity and suggest potential mechanistic differences between male and female dandruff conditions, which may require different intervention strategies. Dandruff can occur when the skin on the scalp becomes itchy and flaky. People with dandruff may experience different levels of severity depending on the extent of the flakes of skin in terms of size and coverage. We looked at the relationship between scalp microbiome (the different types of bacteria and fungi that live on the skin) changes and dandruff severity. We asked whether these changes differ between sexes. We found significant differences in the microbiome of scalps with lower and higher dandruff severities. We discovered this using techniques called 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Scalps with higher dandruff severity showed lower levels of the bacteria Cutibacterium acnes and higher levels of Staphylococcus capitis, Corynebacterium spp. and Malassezia restricta. We also found that men and women had different microbial profiles. The male scalp (even with less severe dandruff) showed a microbial profile like that of more severe dandruff. In conclusion, our findings suggest that dandruff severity is associated with significant microbial changes and indicates sex-related differences in microbiome profiles. This could mean that different treatments might be needed for men and women.",

    "abstract": "The skin microbiome is an integral part of the skin barrier. Its activity is shaped by microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Understanding such interactions is an evolving field essential for uncovering the ecology and functions of a human microbiome community. Various studies have adapted network theory to explore the relationships of the microbiome community and its functional importance in health and diseases. The microbiome network is described as a biomarker depicting the interaction or correlation between two species, rather than their concentrations or abundances as in traditional molecular biomarkers. In skin diseases, the collapse of microbial community network structure has been reported in patients with atopic dermatitis, vitiligo and seborrhoeic dermatitis. More recently, we have reported that a fragile skin microbiome network is becoming a marker consistently observed across skin conditions, such as acne, in preclinical concerns like dry skin and premature ageing, as well as in pollution-compromised skin. In this review, we describe how advanced microbiome networks are constructed to reveal hidden microbiome features based on the nature of polymicrobial interaction from a systems perspective. We discuss the skin microbiome network as a robust network biomarker by capturing skin-microbiome interactions, specifically in conditions where a differential abundance of microbial species is absent, and further as a dynamic network biomarker by capturing skin microbiome dynamics. The skin has a population of microbes, including bacteria, fungi and viruses, that live on it. This is the &#x2018;skin microbiome&#x2019;. Analysing the microbiome helps us understand the complex interactions of microbes in it. It also allows us to find out which microbes are present on the skin and vital to the microbiome. We describe advanced methods used to analyse microbiome data. We summarize current research on the methods used to investigate microbiome networks. We also look at &#x2018;microbiome network biomarkers&#x2019;. These are indicators of normal or abnormal biological processes or responses to treatments. The microbiome network is now seen as a biomarker of skin health. Changes to the microbiome are seen in conditions like acne, dry skin and premature ageing. There are also changes in response to environmental stress like pollution and smoking. Skin microbiome networks are fragile. Using certain products can help restore microbiome networks and improve skin health. Microbiome network biomarkers may help us to understand and treat certain skin issues.",

    "abstract": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a recognized risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, its potential association with the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) after ablation remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate whether Lp(a) serum levels are linked to the risk of recurrent AF following pulsed field ablation (PFA). A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on patients who underwent PFA at the Cardiology Clinic of the Ferrara University Hospital from October 2023 to January 2025. Lp(a) percentile groups were established, with the first 50th percentile serving as the reference. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the relationship between Lp(a) percentile and recurrent AF after PFA. The study included 133 patients (mean age 59.6&#x200a;years, 29.3% women). Over a median follow-up of 7.8&#x200a;months after the blanking period (range: 6.4-9.3&#x200a;months), 29 patients (21.8%) experienced confirmed recurrent AF. A continuous increase in the hazard of recurrent AF was observed with rising Lp(a) levels. Specifically, individuals in the 51st-70th, 71st-90th, and 91st-100th Lp(a) percentiles had adjusted hazard ratios of 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.22, P&#x200a;&lt;&#x200a;0.001], 1.21 (95% CI: 1.11-1.31, P&#x200a;&lt;&#x200a;0.001), and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13-1.39, P&#x200a;&lt;&#x200a;0.001), respectively. Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of recurrent AF after PFA, suggesting that Lp(a)-lowering therapies may be beneficial for these patients.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM). However, it can be altered by LV afterload. The global myocardial work index (GMWI) accounts for LV afterload and could improve risk discrimination when compared with LV-GLS. We sought to determine whether GMWI outperformed LV-GLS for risk stratification in patients with NIDCM. We determined the association between GMWI and a combined endpoint of death or heart failure (HF) admission. We included 524 patients with NIDCM (median age 67&#x200a;years, LVEF 35%), with a median GMWI of 968 mmHg%. Patients with lower GMWI had more frequent history of HF admission, higher E/e' ratio, and worse right ventricular function. During a median follow-up of 3.4&#x200a;years, 171 had the endpoint. There was a significant and nonlinear relationship between GMWI and the endpoint, with a progressive increase in risk until values below 1000 mmHg% were reached, where the risk of the endpoint plateaued. GMWI was strongly collinear with LV-GLS, and both parameters demonstrated similar performance after adjustment, suggesting that GMWI adds little value in this population if LV-GLS has already been accounted for. In patients with NIDCM, lower GMWI is associated with previous HF admission, worse echocardiographic parameters and higher risk of subsequent HF admissions and death, but it does not seem to improve discrimination when compared with LV-GLS.",

    "abstract": "Conditional independence is a foundational concept for understanding probabilistic relationships among variables, with broad applications in fields such as causal inference and machine learning. This study focuses on testing conditional independence, $T\\perp X|Z$, where T represents survival data possibly subject to right censoring, Z represents established risk factors for T, and X represents potential novel biomarkers. The goal is to identify novel biomarkers that offer additional merits for further risk assessment and prediction. This can be achieved by using either the partial or parametric likelihood ratio statistic to evaluate whether the coefficient vector of X in the conditional model of T given $(X^{ \\mathrm{\\scriptscriptstyle \\top } }, Z^{ \\mathrm{\\scriptscriptstyle \\top } })^{ \\mathrm{\\scriptscriptstyle \\top } }$ is equal to zero. Traditional tests such as directly comparing likelihood ratios to chi-squared distributions may produce erroneous type-I error rates under model misspecification. As an alternative, we propose a resampling-based method to approximate the distribution of the likelihood ratios. A key advantage of the proposed test is its double robustness: it achieves approximately correct type-I error rates when either the conditional outcome model or the working model of ${\\rm pr} (X|Z)$ is correctly specified. Additionally, machine learning techniques can be incorporated to improve test performance. Simulation studies and the application to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed tests.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic integration of the lateralized and specialized capacities of the two cerebral hemispheres constitutes a hallmark feature of human brain function. This interhemispheric exchange of information critically depends upon the corpus callosum. Classical anatomical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient from front to back, such that specific transcallosal fibers support distinct aspects of integrated brain function. Here, we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult corpus callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show that full interhemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion of posterior callosal fibers. Partial callosotomy patients with spared callosal fibers retained widespread patterns of interhemispheric functional connectivity and showed no signs of behavioral disconnection, even with only 1 cm of the splenium intact. Conversely, only complete callosotomy patients demonstrated sweeping disruptions of interhemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate an evolving mechanistic understanding of synchronized interhemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior.",

The present paper explores the role they played in people's everyday thinking during the COVID-19 pandemic, including what HAs were used, how they changed over time, who used them, and to what effect. To do this it draws on a longitudinal project in Germany that included a national representative survey (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;1080) and follow-up interviews (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;38) done at three data collection points. The interviews were coded for HAs, the results of which are presented in three steps: first, an overview of the HAs used and their change over time is given; second, characteristics of the most frequent users are outlined; and third, a case study of the most frequent user is presented. The article highlights the everyday use of HAs by people through time, their social distribution between majorities and active minorities, their link to conspiracy mentality and their personal psychological functions.",

The PRISMA method for evidence synthesis was adopted in the study. Studies published from inception through August 2024 that reported a correlation between PTG and rumination (intrusive rumination and deliberate rumination) among people with cancer were identified through systematic searches in nine databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, etc. Stata 18.0 was used to analyze the overall effect size and conduct moderator analysis. Thirty-five studies comprising 8, 398 people with cancer and 70 effect sizes were identified. There was no significant relationship between people with cancer's intrusive rumination and PTG, though factors like multiple cancers and disease stage played a notable role in influencing this relationship. A modest yet positive correlation emerged between deliberate rumination and PTG among those with cancer, with the stage of cancer acting as a key factor in shaping this association. The study suggested that cancer patients with greater degrees of deliberate rumination have a higher likelihood of experiencing growth as a result of cancer. To determine whether the relationship between people with cancer's rumination and PTG changes causally over time, future longitudinal studies should be conducted.",

Despite the growing prevalence of RAS, inconsistencies remain regarding the conceptualization and measurement of team interactions specifically in RAS in the existing literature. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the empirical research on team interactions within RAS, identify research gaps, and propose future directions. We conducted the scoping review following updated methodological guidelines and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting standards. Searches of PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were performed, including empirical articles published between January 2010 and October 2023 focusing on team interactions in RAS. Fifty-four empirical articles were included for analysis. Findings highlighted four major themes: teamwork and communication, non-technical skills, flow disruptions, and teaching/surgical education. Most included studies used quantitative methods and observational data. Communication was frequently studied but inconsistently defined and measured, whereas non-technical skills were more consistently defined and measured. Flow disruptions significantly impacted surgical outcomes, and studies emphasized the need for education on verbal communication strategies in RAS. This review illustrates the inconsistencies in defining and measuring team-related concepts in the literature, highlighting the need for standardized terminologies and measures. Future research should explore mediators and moderators in team interactions in RAS and integrate non-technical skills into training curricula. Such advancements could enhance surgical training, team effectiveness, patient safety, and outcomes associated with RAS.",

Quantitative analysis confirmed the number of &#x3b1;-SMA-positive cells, which were counted to assess their distribution and correlation with severity of fibrotic changes. The area of the vertical section of the tear duct correlated with the area of the fibrous component and the &#x3b1;-SMA-positive cells. Type I collagen density was in correlation with the age of the patients. The area of collagen and &#x3b1;-SMA-positive cells in patients with stenotic and ectatic changes was statistically significantly different. The degree of ectasia showed a significant correlation with the severity of fibrotic changes, including the area of the fibrous component and the number of &#x3b1;-SMA-positive cells.

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Childhood emotional neglect is a prevalent form of maltreatment, with long-term consequences on emotional regulation and relational patterns. Existing literature indicates associations between emotional neglect, substance use disorder (SUD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and intimate partner violence (IPV).<b>Objective:</b> This study investigates how experiences of parental emotional neglect in childhood reflect on behaviours related to the perpetration of IPV in adulthood, with a particular focus on the interaction with PTSD and SUD.<b>Method:</b> A qualitative thematic content analysis was conducted on <i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;28 narratives collected from individuals who underwent Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) within a long-term inpatient substance use treatment facility in the west of Norway. Of the 28 participants 67% were male, and the participants' age ranged from 23 to 58 years (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;37.5, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.8). The age of onset of substance use ranged from 11 to 33 years (M&#x2009;=&#x2009;18.0, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.8). All fit the criteria for PTSD, and all had been subjected to three or more types of potentially traumatic events. Data was collected between May 2021 and May 2024 from a larger clinical project integrating NET and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) for individuals with SUD and PTSD.<b>Results:</b> Four interconnected themes emerged: (1) Enduring impact of childhood experiences on adult life; (2) Interplay between emotional neglect and the search for validation; (3) PTSD Symptoms and Substance Use as Intermediary Factors Connected to Violence; (4) Continuity between early family dynamics and adult intimate relationships.<b>Conclusion:</b> The findings indicate that childhood emotional neglect contributes to adult IPV perpetration through specific PTSD and SUD pathways. The study identified concrete mechanisms linking early emotional wounds to adult violent behaviour, with gender-specific patterns and inferences related to intergenerational transmission. Childhood emotional neglect influences adult emotional regulation and relationship patterns, being an intermediate factor in intimate partner violence.Narratives highlighted gendered aspects of intimate partner violence: men often experiencing normalising violence and women internalising emotional pain, reflecting intergenerational trauma.The study displays how unaddressed childhood adversity in the sample could perpetuate cycles of violence and neglect, impacting adult parenting practices and relationships.",

    "abstract": "The ability to flexibly disengage and shift attention allows us to successfully interact with our environment and develops across infancy, childhood and adolescence. The aim of the present study was to investigate how attentional disengagement abilities develop. We leveraged a robust longitudinal dataset of the Gap-Overlap task of the YOUth cohort with over 3500 children tested at one or more timepoints to track the maturation of attentional control across infancy, childhood and adolescence (5 months, 10 months, 3 years, 6 years, 9 years, 12 years). While we replicated established group-level developmental patterns showing progressive improvement in saccadic reaction times, the time between the appearance of the target and the initiation of the saccade, our findings revealed individual variation in developmental trajectories of the gap effect that cannot be reliably predicted from performance at earlier timepoints. Although we found no associations between Gap-Overlap performance and (parent-reported) attention-related behaviors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;99-734 depending on age and measures), this may reflect the difficulty of identifying early markers in highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders and could be limited by examining subclinical traits rather than diagnosed conditions. The increased understanding of individual developmental patterns established here is a prerequisite for the identification of atypical patterns in clinical assessment. Future studies could build on this work by investigating atypical attention profiles across development and their relationship to Gap-Overlap task performance, particularly in clinical populations where attentional differences may be more pronounced.",

    "abstract": "Eyelid tumors, as an important group of ocular tumors, have received significant attention due to their effects on visual function, physical appearance, aesthetics, and overall quality of life. This study aimed to use scientometric methods to evaluate research trends in the field of eyelid tumors. In this scientometric study, the Scopus database was searched to identify relevant publications. Co-word analysis was performed using VOSviewer software to create a scientific map and identify key areas for future research. The analysis showed that from 1856 to January 2025, a total of 17,179 scientific publications with 209,120 citations were published in this field. The research was classified into four main clusters: ophthalmic symptoms and medical treatments, malignant pathologies and non-surgical methods, diagnostic methods and benign tumors, and basal cell carcinoma and surgical methods. The strong relationship between these clusters indicates the importance of interdisciplinary research. Emerging trends in this field include immunotherapy, new clinical symptoms, and advanced diagnostic techniques such as slit-lamp microscopy. This study outlines current research trends in eyelid tumors, demonstrating a focus on advanced diagnostic techniques, innovative treatment approaches, and management of malignant pathologies. The use of modern technologies like immunotherapy and the development of international collaborations show promise for improving treatment outcomes in the future.",

    "abstract": "The Lombard effect involves involuntary vocal adjustments in noisy environments to enhance speech intelligibility. This study categorizes Lombard speech into distinct \"flavors\" based on perceived intelligibility beyond loudness, focusing on how non-loudness acoustic modifications collectively improve speech intelligibility. A Lombard dataset was collected from 10 speakers across 11 noise levels (30-80 dBA) and two noise types: steady speech-shaped noise (SSN) and dynamic babble noise. Iterative paired-sample t tests were employed to assess the intelligibility of loudness-controlled Lombard speech across various noise conditions, identifying three distinct Lombard flavors for SSN and four for babble: for SSN, LF.0 (30-50 dBA), LF.1 (55-65 dBA), and LF.2 (70-80 dBA); for babble, LF.0 (30-50 dBA), LF.1 (55-60 dBA), LF.2 (65-70 dBA), and LF.3 (75-80 dBA). LF.0 represents plain speech in quiet, while LF.1 to LF.3 reflect progressively stronger adaptations yielding higher perceived intelligibility. Acoustic analysis showed that higher Lombard flavors exhibited significantly increased fundamental frequency (F0), alpha ratio, formant frequencies (F1/F2), vowel duration, and vowel ratio for each noise type. These findings provide insights into intelligibility-enhancing mechanisms in Lombard speech beyond loudness and inform speech technologies, such as telecommunications and hearing aids, aimed at optimizing speech intelligibility while reducing reliance on increased loudness.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAging has been shown to be associated with adverse health outcomes in patients with interstitial lung disease. However, the causal relationship between them is not fully understood. In this study, two-sample Mendelian randomization was applied to analyze the causal relationship between aging phenotypes (facial aging and telomere length) and interstitial lung disease risk.MethodsData on single nucleotide polymorphisms were extracted from the pooled dataset of genome-wide association studies. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were used as instrumental variables. The causal association between aging phenotypes and interstitial lung disease risk was evaluated using inverse variance weighting, Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization, Mendelian randomization-robust adjusted profile score, Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, and weighted median methods.ResultsInverse variance weighting revealed that facial aging increased the risk of genetic susceptibility to interstitial lung disease (odds ratio: 2.336, 95% confidence interval: 1.256-4.342, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007). Telomere length was negatively correlated with interstitial lung disease risk (odds ratio: 0.632, 95% confidence interval: 0.523-0.765, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). No reverse causality was found; interstitial lung disease had no significant effect on facial aging (odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.999, 95% confidence interval: 0.995-1.003, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.664) or telomere length (odds ratio&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.996, 95% confidence interval: 0.989-1.004, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.328).ConclusionThe results of this study show that facial aging significantly increases the risk of interstitial lung disease, while telomere length significantly reduces the risk. Anti-aging may be an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of interstitial lung disease.",

    "abstract": "Although previous research has examined the individual roles of unwanted intrusive thoughts (UITs), inferential confusion and feared selves in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), no study to date has evaluated their combined effects on OCD severity. This is particularly relevant given that the inference-based approach (IBA) posits a close link between inferential confusion and feared selves in the context of obsessional doubt. The present study with a cross-sectional design investigated the role of inferential confusion and feared selves in mediating the relationship between OCD-relevant UITs and OCD severity. A clinical sample of 306 individuals with a primary diagnosis of OCD (mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;32.95, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;9.99, female&#x2009;=&#x2009;58.8%) who also had some comorbid psychiatric disorders, with the exception of a current or previous history of personality disorders, psychotic disorders and substance use disorders, completed a battery of self-reported measures-including the Questionnaire of Unpleasant Intrusive Thoughts, Fear of Self Questionnaire-Multidimensional Version, Patient Health Questionnaire and Expanded Version of the Inference Confusion Questionnaire)-as well as the clinician-administered version of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Bootstrapped mediation analyses (5000 resamples, 95% confidence interval) revealed that UITs were indirectly associated with OCD severity via inferential confusion and one specific dimension of feared selves: the feared corrupted self. Mediation was not supported for the feared culpable or malformed selves in this model. However, a serial mediation pathway emerged wherein inferential confusion and both feared corrupted and culpable selves sequentially mediated the link between UITs and clinician-rated OCD severity. The findings suggest that inferential confusion, along with specific feared self domains, plays a critical role in differentiating intrusive thoughts that are common in the general population from obsessional doubt, as conceptualised in the IBA. Within the inference-based framework, these processes do not merely escalate UITs; rather, they actively produce obsessional doubts that disconnect the individual from reality and render the imagined threat personally meaningful, persistent and in need of resolution.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to design (co-create) and validate a social media resource for mental health literacy (MHL) based on the interests of adolescents. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted between November 2023 and July 2024. The sample comprised 30 third- and fourth-year secondary school students and 10 teachers from three schools in Barcelona, along with 15 health professionals and 7 communication professionals. Co-creation data were collected through student focus groups, and the resource was validated via an online survey completed by the teachers and health and communication professionals. The findings are reported following the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. As part of the resource co-creation process, students chose the: (1) theme (non-suicidal self-harm, and behavioural problems and anger management issues); (2) social media to be used for dissemination (TikTok's For You Page and/or Instagram); (3) format (1- to 2-min video featuring a young professional providing advice/tips and essential information in a friendly, approachable way); and (4) other aspects (use of trends and subtitles). Validation by professionals confirmed that the content, format and dissemination channel are appropriate for reaching adolescents. They also considered the resource useful, reported that they would use it with adolescents in their care, and said they would recommend it. The overall score for the proposed resource was 4.09 out of 5. The co-creation process enabled the design of a social media resource for digital MHL that reflects adolescents' needs and interests. Future research should analyse the potential of such resources to promote MHL among adolescents and define their role within broader interventions. Adolescents, guided by a facilitator, co-designed a mental health resource that was subsequently validated by professionals in education, communication and health.",

This study aims to evaluate the relationship between forearm radiological parameters and fracture complexity, as well as assess clinical outcomes in patients with isolated capitellum fractures. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 28 fractures in 27 patients treated surgically at a tertiary center. Fractures were classified using the Bryan-Morrey system, and forearm parameters (maximum radial bow, location of maximum radial bow, Proximal Ulna Dorsal Angulation 'PUDA', and Proximal Ulna Varus Angulation 'PUVA') were measured. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Quick-DASH scores. Complex fractures (Bryan-Morrey Types 3 and 4) were associated with worse functional outcomes (p&lt;0.05). A significant correlation was found between the distal location of the maximum radial bow and fracture complexity (p=0.0468). Union was achieved in 86.9% of osteosynthesis cases, with AVN and heterotopic ossification observed in some patients. Fracture complexity correlates with poorer functional outcomes. The distal location of the maximum radial bow may influence fracture patterns, suggesting a biomechanical role in energy transfer during FOOSH injuries.

    "abstract": "Background Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its relationship with a risk of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity remains unclear. MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) can accurately quantify liver fat. Purpose To define the precise dose-response relationship between liver MRI-derived PDFF and risk of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity, and to explore the mediating role of liver enzymes. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included adult patients with obesity who underwent MRI to determine PDFF and who were administered a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between September 2020 and December 2023. Based on oral glucose tolerance test results, patients were classified as having normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. Steatosis severity was categorized by PDFF (&lt;5%, 5% to &lt;15%, 15% to &lt;25%, or &#x2265;25%). Multinomial logistic regression assessed the association between liver PDFF and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Mediation analysis evaluated the levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. The findings were validated in an independent cohort. Results A dose-response relationship was found between liver PDFF and abnormal glucose metabolism in 683 patients (mean age, 33 years &#xb1; 6.5 [SD]; 121 male patients). Each 1% increase in PDFF was associated with higher odds of both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Severe steatosis (PDFF &#x2265; 25%) was associated with higher odds of prediabetes (OR, 3.49; 95% CI: 1.35, 9.02; <i>P</i> = .01) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 3.45; 95% CI: 1.30, 9.13; <i>P</i> = .01). The association was partially mediated by aspartate aminotransferase (mediation proportion, 27.3%) and alanine aminotransferase (mediation proportion, 38.8%) (<i>P</i> &lt; .001 for both). These findings were validated because patients with dysglycemia had higher mean liver PDFF than did patients with normoglycemia (19.7% vs 12.9%, respectively; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Conclusion In patients with obesity, the liver MRI-derived PDFF was strongly associated with the odds of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, showing a dose-response relationship partially mediated by liver enzymes. &#xa9; The Authors 2025.

Transverse angular variation (transverse angulation of the glenoid cavity in degrees (TMGC<b>&#xb0;</b>)) was also significantly higher in asymmetric patients (56.24&#xb0;&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.94&#xb0; vs. 52.95&#xb0;&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.63&#xb0;, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046). The contralateral side exhibited greater glenoid cavity depth and height. Correlation heatmaps demonstrated an inverse relationship between APCGmm and AAGC&#xb0;, suggesting a rotational compensatory mechanism. MANOVA confirmed significant overall morphometric differences between groups (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).ConclusionCBCT-based evaluation reveals distinct morphological adaptations in the glenoid fossa of asymmetric patients, including anterior displacement, rotational shifts, and contralateral deepening. These findings support the concept of compensatory TMJ remodeling in response to craniofacial imbalance. The integration of three-dimensional morphometric and angular data enhances diagnostic precision and can inform orthodontic and surgical planning.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectiveHyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is regarded as a significant risk factor for both fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular incidents in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The objective of this research was to investigate the association between cystatin C (CYSC) and HHCY in individuals diagnosed with CKD.MethodsRetrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on clinical data and laboratory data of 85 individuals with CKD. The patients were divided into two distinct groups according to a threshold homocysteine (HCY) level of 15 &#xb5;mol&#xb7;L-1: the normal HCY group consisting of 40 cases, and the high HCY group (HHCY) comprising 45 cases. Moreover, the correlation between CYSC and HCY was examined. The correlation between CYSC and HCY was assessed. To further validate this relationship, HCY levels were measured in the culture medium following CYSC overexpression and silencing in vitro.ResultsOur study found that CYSC levels were significantly elevated in CKD-associated HHCY patients compared to CKD patients without concurrent HHCY (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). CYSC and HCY showed a positive correlation (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). CYSC was determined to be an Independent risk factor for CKD-associated HHCY. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that elevated levels of HCY were observed in the culture supernatants from OE-CYSC mesangial cells compared with the control and OE-negative control groups (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Conversely, the opposite trend occurs.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the findings suggest that CYSC may be the potential to serve as a biomarker to detect high HCY levels associated with CKD.",

    "abstract": "Online sperm donation (OSD) is reshaping donor conception by enabling direct connections between donors and recipients outside clinical settings. This systematised narrative review triangulates existing research on sperm donors and recipients who connect through OSD platforms, comparing their perceptions and experiences across different stages of the donation process. By exploring the complex interplay between donors' and recipients' motivations, it fosters dialogue between research areas often examined in isolation. Studies show that donors and recipients, who often explore alternatives alongside OSD, turn to this option to establish contact, gain flexibility, and sometimes facilitate a relationship between the donor and the child. Donors are primarily motivated by altruism or the desire to transmit their genetic heritage, while recipients often turn to OSD for its affordability and flexibility. Both parties engage in negotiations regarding expectations, insemination methods, and future contact, with both parties assessing trust and compatibility. While many report positive experiences, some-especially recipients-face challenges such as communication difficulties, unsolicited advances or sexual misconduct. In the absence of regulation, recipients bear the burden of managing risks related to safety and donor reliability, whereas donors are mainly concerned with legal parentage. Donors and recipients also differ on the donor's role in the child's life, ranging from no involvement to ongoing contact, with post-conception agreements sometimes evolving. Further research is needed to address key gaps, particularly long-term post-conception experiences and perspectives of recipients and online-donor-conceived individuals. This review highlights that rather than eliminating OSD, policies should prioritise safety, transparency, and informed decision-making while expanding access to fertility clinics and establishing a clear legal framework. A balanced approach-one that respects autonomy while mitigating risks-will be essential to fostering ethical and sustainable donor-recipient arrangements, ensuring positive outcomes, especially for recipients and their families.",

    "abstract": "Menopause is linked to declining ovarian function and adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Early menopause exacerbates these risks, underscoring the need to identify modifiable risk factors. Prior studies associate parabens with altered ovarian reserve markers and ovarian ageing in animal models, yet their relationship with natural menopause onset remains unexplored. This cross-sectional study included 2668 female participants aged 18&#x2009;years and older from the NHANES 2005-2016, excluding those with missing paraben measurements, hysterectomy/ovariectomy or critical variable data. Exposure was assessed via creatinine-corrected urinary concentrations of four parabens [butyl paraben (BuP), ethyl paraben (EtP), methyl paraben (MeP), propyl paraben (PrP)], each categorised by tertiles. The primary outcome was natural menopause onset, defined by self-report (no menstrual periods for &#x2265;12&#x2009;months due to menopause) per NHANES protocol. Weighted Cox regression models were used to examine associations between each paraben and natural menopause onset. Subgroup analyses were conducted by smoking status, alcohol use and oral contraceptive use. Natural menopause occurred in 1043 women in the total population. Compared with women with the lowest tertile of EtP, women in the second tertile of EtP (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.57) and the highest tertile of EtP (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01-1.64) was associated with an increased risk of earlier onset of natural menopause. However, all BuP, MeP and PrP levels were not statistically associated with the onset of natural menopause. The results of subgroup analysis indicated that EtP, MeP and PrP were all associated with the earlier onset of natural menopause in women who did not used oral contraceptives. Our findings suggested an association between higher EtP levels and an earlier onset of natural menopause in general U.S. women. The findings of our study necessitate further prospective epidemiologic research to validate. When women reach menopause, their ovaries work less well, and they face higher chances of heart disease and weak bones. If menopause starts earlier than usual, these health risks get even worse. We did a study to see if four common chemicals called parabens (named butyl, ethyl, methyl and propyl parabens) might be linked to when women start menopause naturally. We used data from 2668 people who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&#xa0;database between 2005 and 2016&#x2014;this is a large, well-known survey that collects health information. To analyse the data, we used a method that helps show connections between factors (like paraben levels and menopause age), and we also looked at groups of women with different habits, such as smoking, drinking or using birth control pills. Our results showed that women with higher levels of one paraben (ethyl paraben) were more likely to start menopause earlier. This link was especially clear in women who did not use birth control pills. We did not find any clear connection between the other three parabens and when menopause started. These findings mean we need more long-term studies to make sure parabens really affect when women start menopause.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases with severe progressive dementia. Amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) deposition and phosphorylated tau accumulation are two typical AD pathologies, which could drive senescence in various types of brain cells. These factors interact to form an entwined vicious cycle, in which each cell could play an irreplaceable role. Thus, it is essential to stress the cause-and-effect relationship in this process and to identify the key factor leading to the vicious cycle. In this narrative review, we discuss (1) how AD pathology induces cellular senescence in different brain cell types; (2) how various accumulated senescent brain cells exacerbate AD pathology; and (3) how cellular senescence and AD pathology are entwined, reinforcing each other through a vicious cycle that accelerates disease progression. We hope to provide insights into the integrated mechanisms linking cellular senescence and AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology could mediate senescence-like phenotypes in various brain cells, and each type of cell plays a key role in AD. Various senescent brain cells could contribute to AD pathology through diverse mechanisms, with each cell type being indispensable. The cause-and-effect relationship between cellular senescence and AD pathology is essential for identifying AD's earlier pathological events and the initiating factors, which still need further exploration. An entwined vicious circle exists between brain cellular senescence and AD pathology, in which chronic inflammation, blood-brain barrier damage, neuron loss, and synapse degeneration all play crucial roles. Clearance of senescent brain cells could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",

    "abstract": "The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, responsible for engaging the hACE2 receptor, is the principal target of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). To better understand how viral evolution undermines NAb protection, we present a comprehensive, topology-based classification derived from 544 NAbs and 60 nanobody-RBD complex structures. Five major NAb classes, each subdivided into two subclasses, were defined by binding zone, angle of approach, hACE2 competition, and hotspot usage. A systematic mapping of NAb-antigen contacts revealed 91 recurrent hotspot residues, some of which remain fully conserved across all Omicron variants. Leveraging&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2,300 experimentally dissociation constants spanning the Wuhan strain and Omicron lineages, we conducted a comparative affinity analysis across subclasses. NAbs in classes 1-3, which overlap the receptor-binding site, show progressive loss of affinity against Omicron, with many failing to bind recent subvariants due to emergent steric clashes and limited affinity maturation against the ancestral Wuhan RBD. Nonetheless, cases of Abs exhibiting resilience to viral drift have been documented. In contrast, classes 4 and 5 maintain high affinity regardless of their initial affinity for parental strains. Contemporary in-silico epitope predictors captured only ~40% of experimentally defined hotspots, highlighting the need for structure-guided approaches. By introducing a refined topological segmentation of the RBD grounded in previously described but unsystematized regions, our classification captures a broad diversity of NAb binding modes and provides an integrative structural framework that harmonizes prior classification schemes, its relationship with circulating variants, and highlights conserved epitope features relevant to broad-spectrum vaccine and therapeutic NAb design.",

    "abstract": "We employed a robust genetic approach to provide a better understanding of whether Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) contributes to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk from a genetic perspective. Multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) was applied to explore causal links between GERD and CAD using genetic instruments derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The MVMR models were adjusted for key metabolic confounders, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Genetic correlations were estimated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Cross-trait meta-analyses, Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics (&#x3c1;-HESS) and colocalization analyses were performed to identify pleiotropic genes and shared genetic loci, elucidating the genetic relationship between GERD and CAD. Genetically predicted GERD was found to be causally linked with CAD (rg&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.37E-52), independent of metabolic risk factors, including LDL-C, BMI, SBP, and HbA1c (odds ratio: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.52, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Cross-trait meta-analyses identified eight novel pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms, four of which were independent of metabolic confounders, including rs11764337 in MAD1L1, rs2240326 in RBM5, rs9615905 in FAM19A5, and rs9837341 in BSN. &#x3c1;-HESS and colocalization analysis further revealed shared genetic loci for GERD and CAD, specifically rs4643373 in IGF2BP1 (located in chr17: 45876022-47517400 and posterior probability for H4&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.75). GERD is identified as an independent risk factor for CAD. The discovery of shared genetic loci provides novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying GERD and CAD, with IGF2BP1 emerging as a potential therapeutic target for intervention.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between cholesterol metabolism and bleeding. We aimed to examine the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or lipid-lowering drugs on bleeding outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses and two types of drug target MR were conducted to evaluate the associations of LDL-C levels with risks for three bleeding outcomes including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIBleeding), and hemorrhage from respiratory passages (HRP). Furthermore, the association between LDL-C and bleeding outcomes was re-evaluated in a retrospective cohort study involving patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). <b>Results:</b> MR analyses suggest that LDL-C levels are not associated with bleeding outcomes, including ICH, GIbleeding, and HRP. SMR also found no causal relationship between the use of lipid-lowering drugs (HMGCR inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors, and NPC1L1 inhibitor) and bleeding outcomes (ICH, GIbleeding, and HRP). Alleles at or near the HMGCR gene (mimicking the effect of statins) reducing LDL-C level expression levels are intended to elevate the risk of ICH (odds ratio (OR) 1.0018, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0001-1.0035, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), independent of their lipid-lowering effect. In the CAD cohort with a 2-year follow up, LDL-C levels measured within the last 3 months of follow up were significantly associated with an increased risk of BARC criteria 3 to 5 grade bleeding (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and showed a trend toward an increased risk of ICH (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.051). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest a potential causal relationship between LDL-C levels and bleeding outcomes, particularly in patients using HMGCR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Computer games have become a significant recreational activity for individuals of all ages, particularly children and adolescents. This study aimed to predict suicidal thoughts based on computer game addiction, considering the mediating role of depression and the moderating role of the game genre among adolescents in Tehran. Using structural equation modeling, a correlational design was considered for this purpose. The study population included 261 adolescents aged 12-18 years residing in Tehran. Participants completed the Farhadi Computer Game Addiction Questionnaire (2017), Beck's Suicidal Ideation Scale (1961), and Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale (2002). The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS-26 and AMOS 24. The direct paths between suicidal thoughts and computer game addiction (&#x3b2; = 0.17), suicidal thoughts and depression (&#x3b2; = 0.51), and depression and online game addiction (&#x3b2; = 0.70) were found to be significant. The relationship between computer game addiction and suicidal thoughts and the mediating role of depression was not significant in adventure, traditional/educational, and simulation genre groups. However, it was significant in the action genre group (&#x3b2; = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05). These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions by counselors and psychologists to address the negative psychological effects of computer game addiction, particularly among adolescents engaging in action games.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric condition associated with significant functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Environmental enrichment (EE), a model encompassing cognitive, social, and physical activities, has demonstrated antidepressant effects in animal models through mechanisms involving brain plasticity. In humans, the influence of EE on depressive symptoms and its clinical significance remain under investigation. This study evaluated the relationship between EE domains and the clinical symptoms of MDD, focusing on the possible modulatory effects of EE on depressive symptomatology. We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study involving 50 adults diagnosed with MDD. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17-items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-HDRS), and EE levels were measured using the Environmental Enrichment Indicator (EEI), which evaluates cognitive, social, and physical activity domains. Correlations between depressive symptoms and EEI domains were analyzed. Participants with higher 17-HDRS scores generally exhibited lower levels of EE. Additionally, individuals with more severe depressive symptoms were less likely to engage in cognitive activities compared to those with milder symptoms; however, this difference was not statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis test, H = 3.82, df = 2, p = 0.14). Notably, higher EE levels were observed among younger participants. The level of EE in individuals with depression may affect symptom severity. Further studies in clinical populations are needed to clarify the relationship between EE and depressive symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated mental health difficulties among couples. Factors such as chronic physical illness, perceived threat of COVID-19, dyadic coping, and relationship quality may influence levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. This study aimed to examine how these individual and relational variables are associated with psychological outcomes in cohabiting couples during the first national lockdown in Portugal. A mixed-methods study was conducted with a sample of 956 individuals (83.9% women), aged 18 to 81 years (M = 40.76, SD = 10.42), living with a romantic partner for at least one year. Participants completed validated self-report instruments: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales - 21 Items (DASS-21) to assess anxiety, depression, and stress; the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) to evaluate COVID-19 threat perception; the Perceived Relationship Quality Component - Short Version (PRQC-SV) to assess relationship quality; and the Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI) to measure dyadic coping. Hierarchical linear regression and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) were used to examine associations between variables. The study received prior approval from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of the University of Coimbra. The regression models accounted from between 17% to 21% of the variances of the dependent variables. In the case of the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) models, the models explained between 11% and 85% of the cases. Hierarchical regression models (HRMs) showed that COVID-19 threat perception and relationship quality were significantly associated with mental health outcomes. In QCA models, low threat perception and high relationship quality and coping skills correlated with lower psychological distress. Chronic illness was not significantly associated with psychological distress when compared to COVID-19 threat perception, relationship quality, and dyadic coping. These insights are vital for managing mental health of couples during crises. By underscoring the importance of threat perception, relationship quality, and coping for psychological well-being management during health crises, this study offers valuable insights for supporting couples through periods of adversity.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are widespread mental health disorders with substantial global influence. dietary exposures have been proposed as modifiable risk factors of these diseases, but their causal relationships remain uncertain. This study aimed to elucidate the causal effects of specific dietary exposures on the risks of anxiety and depression using Mendelian randomisation (MR). Two-sample MR analysis was performed using summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies of European populations. Nineteen dietary exposures, including beef, cereals, tea, non-oily fish and unsalted peanuts, were analysed. Causal estimates were obtained using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, MR-Egger regression and weighted median approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. High consumption of beef (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9182-0.9854, p &lt; 0.01) and cereals (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.9723-0.9982, p = 0.026) was associated with a reduced risk of depression, Whereas high tea consumption (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.0009-1.0176, adjusted p = 0.029) was linked to an increased risk. Regarding anxiety disorders, non-oily fish intake (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.0024-1.0121, p &lt; 0.01) was positively associated with this risk, whereas unsalted peanuts (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.9527-0.9986, p = 0.038) showed a protective effect. This MR study provides genetic evidence supporting the role of specific dietary exposures in influencing the risks of anxiety and depression. The findings highlight the potential of targeted dietary interventions in the prevention and management of mental health disorders.",

    "abstract": "Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) in observational studies, but these findings are susceptible to confounding and reverse causation. This study employed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach to assess the causal relationship between VAT and MDD. We selected 221 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with VAT mass in 325,153 individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank as instrumental variables. Summary-level genetic data for MDD (59,851 cases and 113,154 controls) were accessible from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium database. Primary MR analysis used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, with weighted median and MR-Egger approaches as sensitivity analyses. Additional tests, including MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) and leave-one-out analysis, were conducted to evaluate pleiotropy and robustness. Genetically predicted higher VAT was significantly associated with increased MDD risk (odds ratio (OR) 1.179, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.082-1.285, p &lt; 0.001) based on IVW analysis. Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results (weighted median OR 1.269, 95% CI 1.139-1.414, p &lt; 0.001; MR-Egger OR 1.330, 95% CI 1.023-1.728, p = 0.034). Heterogeneity was observed (Cochran's Q = 353.14, p &lt; 0.001), with no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (MR-Egger intercept p = 0.342). Our findings supported a causal relationship between increased VAT mass and elevated MDD risk. These results suggested that reducing VAT may be a potential strategy for preventing or mitigating MDD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the status of depressive mood in elderly patients with cataract and its association with visual acuity and self-perceived burden (SPB). A total of 210 senile patients with cataract attending the Affiliated People's Hospital of Ningbo University between January 2025 and May 2025 were assessed with the scale, and 197 valid samples were finally obtained. Data on general demographics, underlying disease and best corrected visual acuity in both eyes were collected. The SPB scale (SPBS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) were used to assess the psychological state of the patients. Comparisons between groups were conducted using one-way analysis of variance and the relationship among visual acuity level, SPBS and SDS was analysed. Multiple logistic regression was performed for variables with p &lt; 0.1 in univariate analysis to identify independent risk factors for depression. Of the 197 patients, 84 were male and 113 were female, 59.39% were aged 65 years and older and 64.97% had visual acuity of less than 0.5. The SDS scores ranged from 34 to 70, with a mean of 49.60 &#xb1; 8.33, and the total SPBS scores ranged from 12 to 44, with a mean of 26.15 &#xb1; 7.69. The Pearson's correlation showed that SDS was negatively correlated with visual acuity and significantly positively correlated with the total SPBS score and its dimensions. The results of multiple logistic regression suggested that age (OR = 1.051, p = 0.020), caregiver health status (OR = 1.968, p = 0.046) and diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.396, p = 0.038) were independent risk factors for depression in elderly patients with cataract. Elderly patients with cataract have a high prevalence of depression, which is significantly associated with SPB and depression. Visual acuity level, age, health status of caregivers and comorbid diabetes have a significant impact on the risk of depression.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between two phenomena that can emerge simultaneously in group interaction: autonomic synchrony and the emergence of leadership roles among team members. It was previously shown that the probability distributions of the two processes are both phase shifts characterized by the swallowtail catastrophe distribution. The objective of the present study was to examine the role of team autonomic synchrony as one of the three control parameters in the leadership emergence model. Research participants were 136 undergraduates who were organized into teams of three to five members playing the computer-game Counter-Strike while wearing GSR sensors. After approximately two hours of interaction, team members rated each other on leadership behaviors. Autonomic synchrony was analyzed as a driver-empath process that produces a group-level coefficient of synchrony (SE) from dyadic interactions from all possible dyadic interactions. The model was built in three stages: (a) replicate a model obtained from a similar team effort involving dynamic decisions, (b) test new variables as specific control parameters, and (c) test synchrony metrics for their best fit as one of the three control parameters. Results showed that both synchrony metrics were best understood as bifurcation variables that brought individuals who were already in the zone of potential leaders into primary or secondary roles. Prior gaming experience and SE Variability each played the role of a bias variable that distinguished between primary and secondary leaders. SE Variability also pre-empted team performance as a control variable.",

    "abstract": "Despite junior doctors' pivotal role as primary contacts for students in clinical placements, they are typically offered minimal or no mentor training, and their knowledge about how to facilitate student learning remains experience-based. We developed a co-mentoring program where junior doctors were offered training focused on student learning and agency, near-peer support and the promotion of psychological safety. To evaluate the intervention, we collected qualitative data using interviews, e-mail prompts and a focus group among 13 junior doctors across four cohorts of mentor training. No baseline data were included. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The research aimed to explore the junior doctors' experiences of transitioning from an unclear supervisory role to a defined mentor role with a relational focus. Mentors felt that they were making a significant difference to the students' learning and that focusing on relationship building and belonging enabled entrustment. Furthermore, mentoring was demystified after the training regime. Finally, the concept of collective responsibility throughout the medical department emerged as a crucial element in the mentoring dynamic. Respondents suggested that the intervention had shifted their attitudes: Participants realized that establishing contact and actively collaborating with the students, also beyond the mentor's primary team, were beneficial for both students and mentors without demanding additional sacrifices of time or energy. However, the initiative did not manage to change organizational structures or create motivation in mentors to pursue further pedagogic development, underscoring the need to address structural barriers and promote a growth-oriented mindset among mentors.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the psychometric characteristics of the Persian version of the Integral Nursing Leadership Scale (INLS-P) within the Iranian clinical nurse population. As nursing leadership roles gain importance, there is increasing demand for comprehensive leadership approaches addressing modern healthcare challenges. The INLS-P evaluates four critical dimensions: individual leadership qualities (developing personal competencies), individual performance (optimizing work execution), influencing organizational culture (shaping workplace values), and organizational excellence (driving quality outcomes)-all essential for holistic leadership development. Following COSMIN guidelines, this methodological study was conducted from June to August 2024. A multilevel approach was used: forward-backward translation, face and content validity, construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and reliability of the INLS-P were analyzed, respectively. Our study revealed that the INLS-P demonstrates strong reliability across multiple metrics. Expert evaluations yielded the S-CVI/Ave score of 0.917 regarding content validity. For construct validity, confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the items loaded significantly on their respective factors, with factor loadings ranging from 0.48 to 0.91. Regarding reliability, the overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.924, indicating high internal consistency, while McDonald's omega was 0.931. Coefficient H reached 0.967, further supporting the scale's robustness. Mean interitem correlation averaged 0.427, reflecting solid relationships among items. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was also 0.917, confirming strong stability across the INLS-P. The findings indicate that the INLS-P has acceptable face validity, content validity, structural validity, and reliability when used to measure integral leadership qualities, particularly within nursing. This suggests that the INLS-P is a valid and reliable tool for assessing integral leadership skills in nursing.",

However, emotional, and social factors affecting partnership—such as empathy and gratitude—endure underexplored in Indian higher education institutions (HEIs). Objective-This study thoroughly studies peer-reviewed literature to examine how empathy and gratitude—key elements of emotional intelligence—simplify faculty relationship in Indian universities. Methods- Subsequent PRISMA 2020 parameters, 28 peer-revised articles published between 2013 and 2024 were selected from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Thematic scrutiny was used to join findings, identify conceptual gaps, and offer mark-based proposals. Results- Empathy was found to improve social trust, interaction, and cooperative decision-making, while gratitude adopted emotional elasticity, peer detection, and shared support. Both behaviours served as psychological barriers during the post-COVID move to hybrid academic models. However, institutional orders, siloed units, and lack of emotional training remain major barriers. Suggestions- This study suggests mixing emotional intelligence into faculty development, promoting peer appreciation systems, and creating emotionally caring workplace cultures. Findings influence to theory on prosocial behaviour in academic world and inform policies for successful faculty interactions in Indian HEIs.",

A questionnaire survey was conducted in colleges and universities across the country by using convenient sampling method, and a total of 145 subjects were investigated. In this study, empathy scale, positive emotion scale and college students’ prosocial behavior scale were used to investigate the relationship between them and prosocial behavior. At the same time, gender, origin, only child and other factors are also considered, and the following conclusions are obtained: empathy affects prosocial behavior tendency. The higher the level of empathy, the higher the motivation of helping others and altruistic behavior, and the stronger the prosocial behavior tendency. Emotional health level will affect individual prosocial behavior tendency. The results show that the tendency of prosocial behavior is stronger when the positive emotion of individuals is high. And prosocial behavior also has significant gender differences, that is, male college students’ prosocial tendency is lower than female college students; There are also significant differences in students’ places, and the prosocial tendency of students with urban household registration is lower than that of students with rural household registration.",

Some studies have shown that emotion has a significant influence on individual prosocial behavior, but little research has studied the effect of different types of empathy on college students’ prosocial behaviors. The current study examined the mediating effects of gratitude among the associations between different types of empathy (perspective-taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress) and prosocial behavior among Chinese college students. For the study, we used the Prosocial Tendency Measurement questionnaire, the Hebrew version of Interpersonal Reactivity Index-C, and The Gratitude Questionnaire that investigated 1,037 participants. The results indicated that gratitude played a mediating role between perspective-taking and prosocial behavior, fantasy and prosocial behavior, empathic concern and prosocial behavior, and personal distress and prosocial behavior, respectively.

Purpose: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between the emotional disposition to being grateful and empathetic in parents and their positive parenting attitudes as emotional warmth, autonomy support, and democratic attitude. In addition, the relationship between empathy, gratitude, and negative attitudes such as punitive, permissive discipline and anxious intrusiveness was assessed. Methodology: A sample of 712 Polish parents of children aged between six months and twelve years completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the Gratitude Resentment and Appreciation Test, and the Parental Behaviours and Dimensions Questionnaire. Results: The two proposed structural equation models (SEM) confirmed that empathy and gratitude are predictors of positive and negative parenting dimensions. In addition, gratitude plays a mediating role between different dimensions of empathy and parenting behaviours. Emotional empathy, personal distress and simple appreciation are the most significant factors for positive parental attitudes. Punitive and permissive attitudes are associated with empathy, but not with gratitude. In contrast, anxious intrusiveness is associated with both empathy and gratitude. Conclusions: These findings contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between parents’ emotional resources and their parental behaviours. The results suggest that parents should enhance the experience of empathy and gratitude in their daily lives, as these emotions strengthen positive parental behaviours and weaken negative parenting.",

    "abstract": "Many university students encounter academic challenges that may lead to elevated levels of stress and anxiety, potentially indicating low psychological well-being. This study aims to examine the relationship between gratitude and social support with psychological well-being among university students. A total of 120 participants were selected using a cluster random sampling technique. The study employed a correlational quantitative research design, utilizing three standardized instruments: the Gratitude Scale, the Social Support Scale, and the Psychological Well-Being Scale. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression with SPSS version 27.0. The primary hypothesis testing revealed a significant correlation, with a coefficient of determination R = 0.795 and p = 0.000 (p &lt; 0.01), indicating a strong and statistically significant relationship between gratitude, social support, and psychological well-being. For the first sub-hypothesis, the partial correlation coefficient was 0.327 with a significance level of p = 0.000 (p &lt; 0.01) and a beta value of 0.380, suggesting a significant positive relationship between gratitude and psychological well-being. The second sub-hypothesis showed a partial correlation coefficient of 0.380, a significance level of p = 0.000 (p &lt; 0.01), and a beta value of 0.451, indicating a significant positive relationship between social support and psychological well-being. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that gratitude and social support collectively contribute to 63.2% of the variance in psychological well-being. These results underscore the importance of fostering gratitude and enhancing social support among university students to promote greater psychological well-being.",

Gender-empathic constructions relate to perceptions that individuals hold about self or others as having feminine-empathic gender traits. We hypothesized that empathy will be positively associated with support for compromise, but that perceiving one’s own group as feminine empathic will be negatively associated with such attitudes, with empathy being a significant mediator. Data were collected through a public opinion survey conducted with a representative sample of Israeli-Jewish adults ( N = 511). The findings supported our hypotheses, thus indicating that perceiving one’s own group as having feminine-empathic traits and empathy toward opponents made significant contributions to explaining Jewish-Israeli willingness to compromise with Palestinians. The implications of our findings for understanding the role of gender-empathic constructions and of empathy in conflict resolution are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect of a gratitude journaling intervention on conflict resolution in intimate dyadic relationships via an experimental design. It was hypothesized that mindfully eliciting daily awareness and experiences of gratitude would produce a significant decrease in the adoption of negative conflict resolution styles and an increase in positive conflict resolution strategies. Participants randomly assigned to either a treatment or placebo group were tasked to complete a 15-day gratitude journaling intervention or a 15-day placebo journaling exercise, respectively. All participants answered the Conflict Resolution Style Index (CRSI) immediately before and after the journaling intervention, and at a follow-up posttest another two weeks after. Differences between placebo and treatment groups were analyzed via independent samples t-tests and changes across testing phases within groups were evaluated via repeated measures ANOVA. Thematic analyses of journal entries and interviews with treatment participants further explored the scope of the gratitude experience. Between-group and within-group analyses indicate that participation in a gratitude journaling intervention resulted in increased adoption of more positive conflict resolution styles and decreased adherence to negative conflict resolution styles. The Broaden and Build Phenomenon is inferred as the underlying mechanism that produced these positive effects.",

However, studies demonstrating these effects have induced cognitive load in a temporally limited, artificial manner that fails to capture real-world cognitive load. Drawing from cognitive load theory, we investigated whether naturally occurring cognitive load from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic moderated the relationship between empathy and prosocial behaviour (operationalised as support for public health measures). This large study in an Australian sample (N = 600) identified negative relationships between pandemic fatigue, empathy for people vulnerable to COVID-19, and prosocial behaviour, and a positive relationship between empathy and prosocial behaviour. Additionally, we found that the negative effect of the pandemic on prosocial behaviour depended on empathy for vulnerable others, with pandemic fatigue’s effects lowest for those with the highest empathy. These findings highlight the interrelationships of cognitive load and empathy, and the potential value of eliciting empathy to ease the impact of real-world cognitive load on prosocial behaviour.",

However, the relationship between self-compassion and prosocial behaviour might be mediated by another predictor, such as empathy. The lack of literature discussing self-compassion in adolescents also encouraged this research. In this study, we examine the mechanism between self-compassion and prosocial behaviour through empathy as a possible mediating factor. Participants of this study were 303 adolescents in Indonesia aged 11-18 years old who filled out Self-Compassion Scale, Basic Empathy Scale and Prosocial Tendencies Measure-Revised. All the data were analyzed using the mediation analysis using approach introduced by Hayes. The results of statistical analysis showed there was a direct significant effect of self-compassionon prosocial behaviour (c = 0.10, p&lt;0.05), and there was no significant effect from self-compassionon empathy (b=0.04, 95% CI [-0.030, 0.101]). Therefore, there was no indirect effect from self-compassionto prosocial behaviour through empathy. It can be concluded that empathy is not a mediator in the relationship between self-compassion and prosocial behaviour in adolescents.",

The aim of this research was to investigate the role of gratitude and conflict resolution styles as mediators between religious faith and romantic love.MethodsA structural equation model was performed with data from married males and females from Romania (N = 226, Mage = 40.67, SDage = 11.76). Established measurement tools assessed key variables, while the model's validity was evaluated through multiple statistical benchmarks (e.g., fit indices), allowing a comprehensive assessment of pathways linking religious faith, gratitude, conflict resolution, and romantic love.ResultsAnalyses indicated that religious faith strongly predicted gratitude. Gratitude, in turn, had a favorable impact on cooperative conflict-resolution behaviors, which were closely linked to strengthened romantic love. The model exhibited strong validity.ConclusionsThe findings underscore the central role of intrinsic spiritual values and gratitude in fostering effective conflict management and enriching romantic love. These insights highlight potential applications in therapeutic settings and relationship-building programs, suggesting that fostering these personal qualities could enhance partnership satisfaction.",

The aim of this study is to\n                    explore acts of conflict resolution in an online Spanish mental health forum for recovery from an eating disorder (ED). Focusing\n                    on a specific long dispute between one regular contributor and several other members, I perform a micro-analysis of the discursive\n                    moves deployed in this polylogue by those who act as informal mediators to mitigate negative emotions, to rephrase participants’\n                    perspectives and to promote relational empathy within the group. The goal of mediation in the forum is to reinstate the social\n                    order of acceptable recovery practices and discourses.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on the relationship between empathy and prosocial behavior among individuals aged between 18 to 30 years old . The sample consisted of 90 individuals, including both students and working professionals. The study used the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ) to assess empathy and the Prosocialness Scale for Adults (PSA) was used to measure behavior with the aim of establishing if there exists a notable correlation, between these distinct factors. The study found a significant positive correlation (r = 0.847, p&lt;.001) between empathy and prosocial behavior, suggesting that individuals with higher empathy are more likely to engage in prosocial acts. These results offer supporting evidence for establishing theories like the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis and the Emotional Contagion Theory, which propose that empathy plays a crucial role in motivating altruistic behavior. According to the study, developing empathy in young people may improve prosocial behavior, resulting in more compassionate and socially responsible communities.",

    "abstract": "Gratitude promotes prosocial behavior, but little is known about the psychological mechanisms that underpin this relationship. We examined whether the prosocial repertoire mediates the effects of gratitude on prosocial behavior. Participants were assigned to either a gratitude group or neutral group. We carried out emotion induction manipulation by recalling autobiographical memories and required participants to write prosocial repertoires they intended to do for others. One week later, participants had to report all the prosocial behaviors they engaged in during that period. The results indicated that the number of prosocial repertoires and prosocial behaviors in the gratitude group were higher than in the neutral group. Importantly, our results demonstrated that prosocial repertoires mediated the effects of gratitude on prosocial behavior. Our results suggest that prosocial repertoire is the crucial cognitive component involved in the relationship between gratitude and prosocial behavior.",

Using recognized scales such as the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, Conflict Resolution Style Inventory, Empathy Concern Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale, the study found a noteworthy positive link between emotional intelligence and life satisfaction. Empathy was discovered as a partial mediator in this relationship, enhancing the effectiveness of emotional intelligence by improving emotional awareness. Moreover, conflict resolution was implied to moderate the correlation, strengthening the positive influence of emotional intelligence on life satisfaction. The results emphasize the vital role of emotional intelligence in improving life satisfaction through its effect on both empathy and conflict resolution.",

    "abstract": "Prosocial behaviour towards unrelated others is communally beneficial but can be individually costly. The emotion of gratitude mitigates this cost by encouraging direct as well as \"upstream\" reciprocity, thereby facilitating cooperation. A widely used method for measuring trait gratitude is the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ6) [McCullough, M., Emmons, R., & Tsang, J.&#xa0;(2002). The grateful disposition: A conceptual and empirical topography. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82, 112-127. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.82.1.112 ]. Here we undertake an assessment of the external validity of the GQ6 by examining its relationship with two incentivized economic games that serve as face valid indices of generosity and reciprocity. In two studies (total N&#x2009;=&#x2009;501) we find that trait gratitude as measured by the GQ6 predicts greater donations in a charity donation task as well as greater transfers and returns in an incentivized trust game. These results support the hypothesis that individuals with higher trait gratitude are more generous and trusting on average, and provide initial evidence as to the predictive validity of the GQ6.",

The research involved a study cohort comprising 354 students from secondary schools, 54% (n= 190) of whom were female and 46% (n= 164) of whom were male. Data collection was conducted using the KA-SI Empathic Tendency Scale, the Prosocial and Aggressive Behaviors Scale, and the Bullying Tendency Scale. In addition to descriptive statistics, the data was analyzed using Pearson Correlation Analysis and Simple Mediation Analysis. The results of the study indicate that peer bullying has significant negative relationships with empathy and prosocial behaviors. Furthermore, it was determined that empathic tendency serves as a full mediator variable in the relationship between prosocial behaviors and bullying tendencies. The  findings were discussed in the context of the existing literature, and various suggestions were provided.",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between anxiety caused by coronavirus disease (COVID) and marital satisfaction mediated by empathy and conflict resolution styles in married women.\n          \n          \n            MATERIALS AND METHODS:\n            This descriptive-analytical study was carried out on 326 married women referring to a marriage counseling center in Tehran. Data were collected using the questionnaires of marital satisfaction, marital empathy, conflict resolution styles, and the coronavirus disease anxiety scale (CDAS). Data analysis was performed by Pearson correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n          \n          \n            RESULTS:\n            The psychological symptoms of coronavirus disease anxiety (CDA) had a positive and significant effect on empathy and conflict resolution styles (P &lt; 0.05) while the physical symptoms of CDA had a negative and significant effect on empathy, conflict resolution styles, and marital satisfaction (P &lt; 0.05). The indirect effect of psychological symptoms of CDA on marital satisfaction due to empathy and conflict resolution styles was positive and significant (P &lt; 0.05). The explained variance of marital satisfaction in terms of psychological and physical symptoms of CDA, empathy, and conflict resolution styles was equal to R2 = 0.42.\n          \n          \n            CONCLUSION:\n            Psychological symptoms of CDA increased marital satisfaction by affecting problem-solving styles and marital empathy. Therefore, empathy skills and conflict resolution styles can be used to reduce coronary anxiety and increase satisfaction levels.",

Research has shown that national leaders can leverage their personality – in a general, positive sense – to arouse, in people living beyond their countries’ borders, emotions of empathy or pro-social reactions towards their countries’ citizens. We focus on the personality of Ukrainian President Zelensky and examine which of his personality traits can promote empathy and pro-social behavior towards Ukrainians. In two experimental studies, conducted in Israel and in the US, we found that exposure to a news article that highlights Zelensky’s communal traits (warmth/morality), as compared to his agentic traits (competence/determination), led to (a) increased levels of empathy towards Ukrainian citizens, (b) willingness to help them, and (c) an actual monetary donation for their benefit. We end by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.",

Results showed that children who had more frequent interactions with animals that involved a strong element of companionship reported greater empathy, and that this, in turn, related positively to prosocial behavior (measured by teacher’s report). A mediational model in which empathy accounts for the effect of positive interactions with animals on prosocial behavior provides consistent, if not conclusive, support for the relationship between interacting with animals and socio-emotional development.",

While this signification cannot be negated, a deeper articulation of liminal existences in the conflict‐prone areas requires more attention. Using case studies with a qualitative research design, the paper emphasizes on conflict as a social force, facilitating the (re)structuration of communities entangled within it. The paper explores the mundane lived experiences of the Adivasis and the Bodos, two of the ethnic communities living in Assam, a Northeastern state of India, by making a few claims. First, ethnic conflicts reorient social relations, intercommunity interactions and economic exchanges between the Adivasis and Bodos. Second, ethnic conflicts recourse varied negotiations and emotions in their being(ness), aspirational values, and embodied meanings in mundane life‐processes. The complex realization of identities for the Adivasis and the Bodos is fostered by the exposure of fear, past loss of life, and the varied interactions between victims and perpetrators in everyday social life.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the results of an empirical study on the relationship between empathy and prosocial behavior in a student environment. The theoretical analysis of recent research and publications confirmed the key role of empathic sensitivity in shaping socially significant activities among youth. The aim of the study was to identify the nature and strength of the connections between various aspects of empathy and forms of prosocial behavior among students.\n\nThe research was conducted at Kyiv National Linguistic University (Ukraine), involving 120 students majoring in Psychology, aged 18 to 22. A set of psychodiagnostic methods was applied, including the Interpersonal Reactivity Index by M. Davis, the Prosocial Tendencies Scale by G. Carlo and B. Randall, sociometry by J. Moreno, and a survey on volunteer experience. Data were processed using descriptive statistics, correlation, and comparative analysis. \n\nThe empirical data obtained indicate that high levels of empathic concern and perspective-taking are closely correlated with the willingness to provide emotional and altruistic assistance, while excessive personal distress reduces the level of prosocial behavior. Gender differences in prosocial behavior among youth were identified: female students more often demonstrate emotional forms of help, while male students exhibit public forms. Social experience also has a significant impact: participation in volunteer initiatives increases both empathy and prosocial activity levels. The practical significance of the study lies in developing recommendations for integrating empathetic practices into the educational process, fostering volunteer programs, and creating a culture of support in the academic environment. Future research should focus on the longitudinal analysis of changes in empathy and prosocial behavior throughout the entire period of psychology students’ in higher education.",

    "abstract": "Gratitude is a fundamental social-emotional construct that has been associated with prosocial behaviors. While extensive research has highlighted its positive connections to well-being and social relationships in adults and adolescents, less is known about how gratitude emerges in early childhood and how it relates to prosocial behaviors. This study examines the multidimensional nature of gratitude in preschool children, focusing on different aspects—expressing thanks, appreciating what one has, positive social comparison, and savoring the present moment—and their associations with prosocial behaviors such as helping, sharing, and cooperating. A sample of 478 preschoolers was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore these relationships. The findings show that appreciating what one has is positively associated with prosocial behavior, whereas other dimensions, such as gratitude expression and positive social comparison, do not demonstrate significant associations. These results provide insights into the role of gratitude in early childhood and its potential relevance for educational approaches aimed at fostering gratitude and social responsibility in young children.",

This review examines the role of empathy in interpersonal and intergroup relations, including intractable conflicts. Despite the limitations of empathy, there is growing evidence that empathy and compassion are associated with more prosocial behavior in interpersonal relations. Furthermore, empathy and compassion have been associated with more favorable attitudes and higher readiness for reconciliation across a range of intergroup settings. This review ends by summarizing recent evidence for the beneficial effects of compassion training on interpersonal and intergroup relations and by outlining new avenues for future research on how compassion training could reduce intergroup conflicts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis study examined the impact of childhood traumas on communication abilities, conflict resolution strategies, and stress‐coping mechanisms in organizational life. It employed a combination of descriptive, correlational, and causal‐comparative models within the quantitative paradigm. The sample consisted of 225 adults. The Childhood Traumas Scale and CCCSM scale were used to collect data. Both descriptive and inferential techniques were utilized for statistical analysis. Results showed that most of the participants' traumas were related to emotional neglect, whereas the least of the traumas were associated with sexual abuse. The mean levels of CCCSM were higher for those without trauma when compared with those with low, medium, and high trauma. Traumas were positively correlated with stress management (r = 0.174, p &lt; 0.01) and negatively correlated with conflict (r = −0.258, p &lt; 0.01), as well as communication management (r = −0.369, p &lt; 0.01). Emotional neglect emerged as a significant predictor of deficits in communication and conflict management, explaining 14.3% and 7.9% of the variance, respectively. This underscores its detrimental impact on essential interpersonal skills. Conversely, the positive association between emotional abuse and stress management (3.8% variance) suggests a complex interplay in which certain traumas may inadvertently enhance coping mechanisms. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing effective interventions and support systems for trauma survivors.",

Less is known about which factors may promote empathy, particularly among children, in contexts of intergroup conflict. Empathy may depend on underlying cognitions, such as social essentialist beliefs, that is, believing that certain social categories have an underlying essence that causes members to share observable and non‐observable properties. This study explored the influence of essentialist beliefs about ethno‐religious categories on outgroup‐directed empathy, attitudes and prosocial behaviours of children living in Northern Ireland (N = 88; M = 7.09, SD = 1.47 years old). Bootstrapped chain mediation found that lower essentialist beliefs predicted greater outgroup‐directed empathy, which was positively related to outgroup attitudes, which in turn, predicted more outgroup prosocial behaviours. The findings highlight the importance of essentialist beliefs as an underlying factor promoting empathy, with links to prosocial behaviours in settings of intergroup conflict. The intervention implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article reinvestigates the relationship between real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and terrorism. We devise a terrorism Lorenz curve to show that domestic and transnational terrorist attacks are each more concentrated in middle-income countries, thereby suggesting a nonlinear income–terrorism relationship. Moreover, this point of concentration shifted to lower income countries after the rising influence of the religious fundamentalist and nationalist/separatist terrorists in the early 1990s. For transnational terrorist attacks, this shift characterized not only the attack venue but also the perpetrators’ nationality. The article then uses nonlinear smooth transition regressions to establish the relationship between real per capita GDP and terrorism for eight alternative terrorism samples, accounting for venue, perpetrators’ nationality, terrorism type, and the period. Our nonlinear estimates are shown to be favored over estimates using linear or quadratic income determinants of terrorism. These nonlinear estimates are robust to additional controls.",

This research investigates the differences between how satisfied and dissatisfied spouses get along with their in‐laws, and how each group responds to in‐law conflicts. For this purpose, we conducted two studies. In a quantitative study, we compared the responses of two groups of people who were either satisfied (n = 167) or dissatisfied (n = 166) with their in‐law relationship, and how they responded to conflict situations. In the qualitative study, we interviewed 22 participants and asked them about conflicts with their in‐laws and responses to those conflicts. Results revealed significant differences between the methods used by satisfied and dissatisfied participants. Both studies showed that direct expression of annoyance is not an effective option in responding to in‐law conflicts. Findings led to an optimal model for responding to differences with in‐laws. The model has three stages: (a) the personal stage, (b) the inter‐couple stage, and (c) the response to the in‐law stage. It seems that when spouses are satisfied with in‐law relationships, they take a conservative approach when conflict arises. The model can be used in educational, preventive, and therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Background: The Voluntary Corps (KSR) is the spearhead of PMI in the field. KSR members must have the awareness to devote themselves to humanitarian tasks. The empathy that KSR volunteers have can motivate volunteers to help others. Volunteers who have high levels of empathy will improve their prosocial behavior. Methods: Correlation analytic research design uses a Cross Sectional study approach. Sampling research using Simple Random Sampling was dine on as many as 110 volunteers KSR PMI Surabaya City. Empathy and Prosocial Behavior Factors in volunteers were measured using an online questionnaire (via google form). Data analysis used Spearman Rho test with significance (p &lt; 0.050). Results: The results showed that 106 (97.3%) respondents had moderate empathy, with 104 respondents having moderate prosocial behavior. About 4 other respondents have low prosocial behavior and 1 respondent has high prosocial behavior. The results also show that 3 (2.7%) respondents have low empathy with low prosocial behavior in 1 person and moderate prosocial behavior among 2 people. Spearman Rho test showed that there was a relationship between empathy and prosocial behavior in KSR PMI volunteers in Surabaya City with p value = 0.040 (p &lt;0.050) r = 0.196. Conclusion: Empathy possessed by KSR volunteers is an important factor for prosocial behavior. The results of this study indicate that the active role of KSR volunteers is needed to motivate their colleagues and to cultivate a sense of empathy in order to grow high prosocial behavior.",

Instead, nuclear weapons are relevant as part of a category of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that includes chemical and biological weapons (CBWs). Are the factors that drive CBWs proliferation similar to those that drive nuclear proliferation? What is the relationship between these weapons types? In this article, we explore whether nuclear weapons and CBWs serve as complements or substitutes. Using newly collected data on both CBWs pursuit and possession over time, we find that nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons generally function as complements at the pursuit stage. In addition, countries that acquire nuclear weapons become less interested in pursuing other types of WMDs and are even willing to give them up in some cases.",

    "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to understand another one’s mental states in terms of emotions and thoughts. In the pubblic mind, often, this skill is directly related to the ability to act in a prosocial, or moral, way. Clinical literature shows us that some neural deficits and psychological disorders can actually cause a significant lack of empathic ability and therefore the implementation of socially maladaptive behaviours, even criminal. However, there are also some diagnostic categories characterised by failure to “put yourself in another’s shoes”, but patients don’t usually act in an antisocial way; then, not all the criminals meet the criteria for psychiatric diagnosis. So, the question is: only low levels of empathy leads to antisocial behaviours? And if so, does therapeutic interventions for empathic skill entail moral enhancement? The present work aim to answer to all those issues through a multilevel and cross-discilplinary analysis of psychology, neurosciences and philosophy literature.",

This study examined the association between empathy and prosocial behavior in a sample of 1171 adolescents in China. An empathy questionnaire, social support rating scale, and helping attitude scale were applied in the study. Empathy had an influence on prosocial behavior through social support as a mediating factor. The mediating effect of social support between empathy and prosocial behavior was mainly manifested through perceived social support. The current findings imply that cultivating the empathy of adolescents and promoting their perceived social support may be effective to enhancing their prosocial behavior.",

Students com-pleted questionnaires concerning humility (BSHS scale), gratitude (GQ scale), empathy (QCAE inventory), and perceived false self (POFS scale).ResultsThe results confirmed significant correlations between gratitude, empathy and authenticity, but not with humility. Further analysis revealed that gratitude and affective and cognitive empathy explain 9% of the perceived false identity level. The findings confirmed the mediation effect of gratitude on the associations between (1) humility and false self, (2) affective empathy and false self, but not between cognitive empathy and false self. The results also indicated that humility may in-fluence authenticity indirectly via gratitude, but not via dimensions of empathy.ConclusionsThe findings confirm the significance of gratitude and cognitive empathy as dispositions that promote a feeling of being authentic. On the other hand, the relationship between affective empathy and false self was positive.",

    "abstract": "Conflict is inevitable in our human society due to the continuous interaction between people. The same occurs between administrative and teaching staff in schools as a result of their close interaction. This study explored how effective communication could be employed to resolve conflicts between administrative and teaching staff in two selected private senior high schools in Winneba. The study employed mixed method approach with the exploratory design to analyze and interpreted the conflicts that arise between administrators and teachers. Quota, simple random and purposive sampling approaches were used to select the respondents. Questionnaires and semi- structured interview guide were used to collect data for the study. The findings of the study revealed that conflicts exist between the administrators and teachers in the schools and such arises due to problems of communication. Staff meetings are the major means of communication between these two groups but social media use is also becoming a popular means of communication. Effective communication in the form of dialogue and negotiation can best help to resolve the conflict between teachers and administrators in the schools. It was concluded that lack of effective communication, and limited avenues for teachers to express their grievances, as well as poor feedback result in conflicts in the schools. Regular interaction through intensifying staff meeting and one-to-one communication can help resolve school conflicts. It was therefore recommended that workshops on effective communication should be organized for teachers and administrative staff to improve on their communication skills.",

This article is informed by Edward Said’s hypothesis of orientalism, specifically that Western knowledge of the Eastern world(s) carries a negative connotation. Testing this hypothesis on the materials of elite interviews conducted in Ukraine in 2017, the article ‘maps’ the image of the world from a Ukrainian point of view. It explores if an internalized ‘othering’ may be present within Ukraine’s borders due to the ongoing conflict in the East. The findings, however, disprove this assumption. Results show that there is a perceived sense of closeness between Ukraine and Eastern European countries due to historical and cultural ties as well as modern day partnership. Relations with Russia were perceived as ambiguous despite the armed conflict in the East and the annexation of Crimea. There is also no evidence for “othering of Eastern vis-à-vis Western regions inside Ukraine.",

Destructive tendencies resulting from perceptions or expectations deeply rooted in different cultural backgrounds, can only be overcome through the conscious effort to create a basic, mutually acceptable communication sub-culture in which trust plays a central role. Rather than approaching any given negotiation situation with a fixed, preconceived action model already in mind, communication scholars will have to begin their work much earlier. Individual, social, and cultural components which exist prior to interpersonal communication situations will have to be identified and studied. This approach requires the initial acceptance of complexity, and the ability to allow specific conditions to assist them in discovering and developing situationally appropriate techniques.",

This meta-analysis investigates if, and under what circumstances, spaced and retrieval practice can benefit mathematics learning. We found a robust small to medium effect of spaced versus massed practice overall (g = 0.28, 27 studies, 53 effect sizes). Those studies can be split into two subsets based on their experimental design, where material was either taught in isolation (10 studies, 27 effect sizes) or as part of a course (17 studies, 26 effect sizes). We found a larger, yet less robust, effect for the isolated learning (g = 0.43) than for course-embedded (g = 0.24). Our search also revealed seven studies, 32 effect sizes, which manipulated testing versus restudy. The weighted mean effect of testing versus restudy was g = 0.18. However, the 95% confidence interval crossed zero, suggesting the testing effect is not robust. Overall, our results suggest that spaced practice can improve mathematics learning for material in isolation and within a course. However, the effect may be smaller than in other domains. Additionally, the current literature does not provide conclusive evidence for a consistent effect of retrieval practice for mathematics learning, possibly due to the smaller number of studies available.",

    "abstract": "Background: Undergraduate STEM instructors want to help students learn and retain knowledge for their future courses and careers. One promising evidence-based technique that is thought to increase long-term memory is spaced retrieval practice, or repeated testing over time. The beneficial effect of spacing has repeatedly been demonstrated in the laboratory as well as in undergraduate mathematics courses, but its generalizability across diverse STEM courses is unknown. We investigated the effect of spaced retrieval practice in nine introductory STEM courses. Retrieval practice opportunities were embedded in bi-weekly quizzes, either massed on a single quiz or spaced over multiple quizzes. Student performance on practice opportunities and a criterial test at the end of each course were examined as a function of massed or spaced practice. We also conducted a single-paper meta-analysis on criterial test scores to assess the generalizability of the effectiveness of spaced retrieval practice across introductory STEM courses. Results: Significant positive effects of spacing on the criterial test were found in only two courses (Calculus I for Engineers and Chemistry for Health Professionals), although small positive effect sizes were observed in two other courses (General Chemistry and Diversity of Life). Meta-analyses revealed a significant spacing effect when all courses were included, but not when calculus was excluded. The generalizability of the spacing effect across STEM courses therefore remains unclear. Conclusions: Although we could not clearly determine the generalizability of the benefits of spacing in STEM courses, our findings indicate that spaced retrieval practice could be a low-cost method of improving student performance in at least some STEM courses. More work is needed to determine when, how, and for whom spaced retrieval practice is most beneficial. The effect of spacing in classroom settings may depend on some design features such as the nature of retrieval practice activities (multiple-choice versus short answer) and/or feedback settings, as well as student actions (e.g., whether they look at feedback or study outside of practice opportunities). The evidence is promising, and further pragmatic research is encouraged.",

This replication-extension study of Susser and McCabe (Susser and McCabe in Instr Sci 41:345-363, 2013) supports their original findings regarding spaced practice and extends the investigation to self-testing. Using the same survey method as the previous researchers, we found that college students showed awareness of the efficacy of spaced practice over massed practice and reported using it in ideal situations. Students reported greater use of spaced studying when a test was difficult, more heavily weighted, or over material of future use. Greater metacognitive self-regulation and elaboration was related to greater reported use of spaced practice. Extending beyond the original study to look self-testing, students were aware of the usefulness of self-testing. Similar to spaced practice, students reported being more likely to use self-testing for more difficult tests and heavily weighted tests. Those with greater metacognitive self-regulation were also more likely to report greater use of self-testing, although greater elaboration was not correlated with reported use of self-testing. Students with a higher GPA were also more likely to report spaced studying and self-testing. Findings suggest that students do know about some effective study strategies. Use of effective strategies may be helpful but students do not report using them in all settings. Educators may be interested in creating circumstances that encourage students to use effective strategies.",

The total dataset was divided into two subsets to investigate two main questions: (1) Does spaced retrieval practice induce better memory retention than massed retrieval practice? (subset 1); and (2) Is the expanding spacing schedule superior to the uniform spacing schedule when learning with retrieval practice? (subset 2). Using meta-regression with robust variance estimation, 39 effect sizes were aggregated in subset 1 and 54 in subset 2. Results from subset 1 indicated a strong benefit of spaced retrieval practice in comparison with massed retrieval practice (g = 0.74). Results from subset 2 indicated no significant difference between expanding and uniform spacing schedules of retrieval practice (g = 0.034). Moderator analyses on this subset showed that the number of exposures of an item during retrieval practice explains inconsistencies between studies: the more learners are tested, the more beneficial the expanding schedule is compared with the uniform one. Overall, these results support the advantage of spacing out the retrieval practice episodes on the same content, but do not support the widely held belief that inter-retrieval intervals should be progressively increased until a retention test.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Researchers in the cognitive sciences have identified several key training strategies that support good encoding and retention of target information. These strategies are retrieval-based practice, also known as learning through testing, and spaced practice. The recent resurgence of research on retrieval-based and spaced practice has been extended to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies to support learning in individuals with language disorders. The purpose of the current article is to review key principles of retrieval-based and spaced practice that can be used to support word learning in individuals within clinical and educational contexts. Conclusion: Current research provides evidence that principles of retrieval-based and spaced practice can enhance word learning for individuals with language disorders. Current research provides guidance for clinicians on how to implement these strategies both within and across sessions to support encoding and retention of target information. Additional research should be conducted to provide a better understanding of how to optimize encoding and retention in clinical and educational contexts. Most notably, research that examines long-term retention after interventions are withdrawn would further our understanding of how these principles can be optimally applied to improve outcomes for individuals with language disorders.",

    "abstract": "Students and educators often face time constraints, making it essential to develop interventions that are both easy to implement and have a substantial impact on learning and performance. One promising strategy is retrieval practice, particularly in the context of physics education, where many students struggle with basic knowledge. Prior research has shown that retrieval practice improves self-explanation and problem-solving performance, yet many students avoid it, even when resources are provided. To address this, we introduced a mandatory retrieval test with a minimum benchmark of 50% to encourage greater engagement with retrieval practice. The primary aim of this study was to explore students' experiences with the test and its impact on their use of retrieval practice. A secondary aim was to examine whether increased retrieval practice effort correlated with improved performance on factual, conceptual, and problem-solving exams. Interviews with 13 students revealed that about half crammed for the test, while the other half spaced their practice throughout the semester. Several students noted that the test motivated them to both memorize and understand the principles, with no complaints about the mandatory test. Of the 463 students, 179 achieved a perfect score, suggesting substantial engagement. Effect sizes on factual, conceptual, and problem-solving performance tests ranged from negligible to large, indicating substantial potential benefits with minimal risk. In conclusion, the mandatory retrieval test is an effective, low-effort intervention for educators, promoting greater student adoption of retrieval practice and yielding both qualitative and quantitative evidence of enhanced learning and performance.",

In all experiments, participants studied 40 Swahili-English word pair translations during an initial study phase, restudied intact pairs or attempted to retrieve the English words to Swahili cues twice in three spaced practice sessions, and then completed a final cued-recall test. All 5 sessions were separated by 2 days. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the response format during retrieval (covert vs. overt) and the test list structure (blocked vs. intermixed covert/overt retrieval trials). A memory rating was required on all trials (retrieval: &quot;Was your answer correct?&quot;; restudy: &quot;Would you have remembered the correct translation?&quot;). Response format had no effect on recall, but surprisingly, final test performance for restudied items exceeded both the overt and covert retrieval conditions. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the requirement to make a memory rating. If a memory rating was required, final test restudy performance exceeded retrieval performance, replicating Experiment 1. However, the pattern was descriptively reversed if no rating was required. In Experiment 3, the memory rating was removed altogether, and we examined recall performance for items restudied versus retrieved once, twice, or thrice. Performance improved with practice, and retrieval performance exceeded restudy performance in all conditions. The reversal of the typical retrieval practice effect observed in Experiments 1 and 2 is discussed in terms of theories of reactivity of memory judgments.",

How retrieval can boost the retention of memories is still without unanimous explanation. In 3 experiments, focusing on the reaction time (RT) of retrieval, we showed that RT of retrieval during retrieval practice followed a power function speed up that typically characterizes automaticity and skill learning. More important, it was found that the measure of goodness of fit to this power function was associated with long-term recall success. Here we suggest that the automatization of retrieval is an explanatory component of the testing effect. As a consequence, retrieval-based learning has the properties characteristic of skill learning: diminishing involvement of attentional processes, faster processing, resistance to interference effects, and lower forgetting rate.",

Method: Following a brief review of earlier findings on word learning in children with SLI and the assumptions behind retrieval practice, four experiments are described that compared novel words learned in a repeated spaced retrieval condition and those learned in either a repeated study condition or a repeated immediate retrieval condition. Preschool-age children with SLI and their same-age peers with typical language development were the participants in all experiments. The effects of repeated spaced retrieval were assessed through measures of recall of word form and meaning and, receptively, through both picture-pointing and electrophysiological measures. Results: Repeated spaced retrieval resulted in greater recall of word form and meaning across the experiments. This advantage was seen not only for word-picture pairs used during the learning period but also when generalization of the word to new pictures was required. Receptive testing through picture pointing showed similar results, though in some experiments, ceiling effects rendered this measure less sensitive to differences. An alternative receptive measure--the N400 elicited during picture-word mismatches--showed evidence at the neural level favoring repeated spaced retrieval. The advantages of repeated spaced retrieval were seen in both children with SLI and their typically developing age mates. Conclusion: Future efforts are warranted to refine and extend the experiments reviewed here. If these efforts prove successful, procedures that incorporate repeated spaced retrieval into more naturalistic clinical and educational activities might be an appropriate next step.",

    "abstract": "Two experiments determined whether metamemory judgments invoking covert retrieval practice for a list of unrelated paired associate words led to the facilitation of learning a subsequent list. Three types of relation between successive lists were compared: negative transfer (A-B, A-D); a control for item-specific proactive interference (A-B, C-D); and repetition (A-B, A-B). Experiment 1 showed that the benefit of retrieval practice relative to restudying was equivalent for overt and covert retrieval in the negative transfer paradigm (A-B, A-D). Both types of retrieval minimized intrusions of first list responses in the cued recall of the second list. Experiment 2 showed that memory enhancement following covert retrieval was equivalent for new (C-D) and repeated (A-B) lists. The results are consistent with theories of the forward testing effect (FTE) that assume retrieval practice insulates subsequent learning from proactive interference and provides self-assessment feedback that may lead to more efficient encoding in future learning. Challenges in accounting for the impact of a substantial number of moderators of the FTE are reviewed.",

The present research examines how practice, feedback, and instruction influence JOLs for spaced and massed items. In Experiment 1, in which JOLs were made after the presentation of each item and participants were given multiple study-test cycles, JOLs were strongly influenced by the repetition of the items, but there was little difference in JOLs for massed versus spaced items. A similar effect was shown in Experiments 2 and 3, in which participants scored their own recall performance and were given feedback, although participants did learn to assign higher JOLs to spaced items with task experience. In Experiment 4, after participants were given direct instruction about the benefits of spacing, they showed a greater difference for JOLs of spaced vs massed items, but their JOLs still underestimated their recall for spaced items. Although spacing effects are very robust and have important implications for memory and education, people often underestimate the benefits of spaced repetition when learning, possibly due to the reliance on processing fluency during study and attending to repetition, and not taking into account the beneficial aspects of study schedule.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge college students face is retaining the knowledge they acquire in their classes, especially in cumulative disciplines such as engineering, where ultimate success depends on long-term retention of foundational content. Cognitive psychologists have recently recommended various techniques educators might use to increase retention. One technique (&quot;spaced retrieval practice&quot;) involves extending opportunities to retrieve course content beyond a customarily short temporal window following initial learning. Confirming the technique's utility requires demonstrating that it increases retention in real classroom settings, with commonly encountered educational content, and that gains endure into subsequent semesters. We manipulated spaced versus massed retrieval practice in a precalculus course for engineering students and followed a subset of students who proceeded into a calculus class the following semester. Spacing versus massing was manipulated within- and between-subjects. Within-subjects, students retained spaced content better than massed content in the precalculus course. Between-subjects, students for whom some retrieval practice was spaced, compared to those for whom all practice was massed, performed better on the final exam in the precalculus class and on exams in the calculus class. These findings suggest that spaced retrieval practice can have a meaningful, long-lasting impact on educational outcomes.",

In this preregistered study, we compared two types of spacing--an expanding retrieval practice schedule and an equally spaced schedule--to determine if one of these approaches yields better word learning outcomes for the children. Method: Fourteen children with DLD aged 4-5 years and 14 same-age children with typical language development (TD) learned eight novel nouns over two sessions. Spacing for half of the novel words was expanded gradually during learning; for the remaining novel words, greater spacing remained at the same level throughout learning. Immediately after the second session and 1 week later, the children's recall of the words was tested. Results: The children with TD recalled more novel words than the children with DLD, although this difference could be accounted for by differences in the children's standardized receptive vocabulary test scores. The two groups were similar in their ability to retain the words over 1 week. Initially, the shorter spacing in the expanding schedule resulted in greater retrieval success than the corresponding (longer spaced) retrieval trials in the equally spaced schedule. These early shorter spaced trials also seemed to benefit retrieval of the trials with greater spacing that immediately followed. However, as the learning period progressed, the accuracy levels for the two conditions converged and were likewise similar during final testing. Conclusion: We need a greater understanding of how and when short spacing can be helpful to children's word learning, with the recognition that early gains might give a misleading picture of the benefits that short spacing can provide to longer term retention.",

However, learners do not always appreciate the benefits of testing for memory and do not use it as effectively as they could during their own self-regulated learning. The goal of this review is to identify common themes from research focused on learners' metacognition about practice testing using the three components of metacognition (i.e., beliefs, monitoring, and control) as an organizational guide. To foreshadow the key findings from this research: (1) without support, learners lack metacognitive awareness of testing as a tool to enhance memory but do recognize that testing can be used as a monitoring tool; (2) learners can accurately monitor their learning while using practice testing when judgments are made in contexts that are representative of those encountered during a criterion test; (3) in educational contexts, learners report using less effective strategies equally or more often than practice testing; and (4) learners tend to test themselves only under conditions that encourage retrieval success, and rarely use a strategy involving repeated successful retrieval even when it would lead to improved retention. After reviewing research findings, I discuss various interventions that lead to learners using testing more often and more effectively in their own learning and offer recommendations for future research.",

Methods: In 4 people with aphasia with naming impairment, we compared the benefits of naming treatment that emphasized &quot;retrieval practice&quot; (practice retrieving target names from long-term memory) with &quot;errorless learning&quot; (repetition training, which preempts retrieval practice) according to different schedules of learning. The design was within subjects. Items were administered for multiple training trials for retrieval practice or repetition in a &quot;spaced&quot; schedule (an item's trials were separated by multiple unrelated trials) or &quot;massed&quot; schedule (1 trial intervened between an item's trials). In the spaced condition, we studied 3 magnitudes of spacing to evaluate the impact of effortful retrieval during training on the ultimate benefits conferred by retrieval practice naming treatment. The primary outcome was performance on a retention test of naming after 1 day, with a follow-up test after 1 week. Results: Group analyses revealed that retrieval practice outperformed errorless learning, and spaced learning outperformed massed learning at retention test and at follow-up. Increases in spacing in the retrieval practice condition yielded more robust learning of retrieved information.

Usage of two study tools -- an online textbook and quiz tool -- was recorded daily. We operationalized spacing as how often the tools were used and the timing of their use relative to exams. We found that students increased their study near deadlines and exams, used the textbook more often than the quiz tool, and used the tools infrequently when they were optional (vs. required). Importantly, spaced retrieval practice (via quiz tool) predicted course performance and GPA, whereas spaced reading (via textbook) was a weaker predictor. That is, when students opted for more frequent and early quizzing, they earned higher grades, even controlling for time spent quizzing. Thus, self-selected spaced study -- especially spaced retrieval practice -- supports student achievement.

    "abstract": "The testing effect, defined as the positive effect of &quot;retrieval practice&quot; (i.e., self-testing) on long-term memory retention relative to other ways to support learning, is a robust empirical phenomenon. Despite substantial scientific evidence for the testing effect, less is known about its effectiveness in relation to individual differences in cognitive ability. In the present study, we examine whether the effect of retrieval practice is beneficial independent of cognitive ability using behavioral and brain imaging data. In a within-subject design, upper-secondary students learned Swahili-Swedish word pairs through retrieval practice and study. The testing effects were assessed at a direct test and for a subsample after 1- and 4-weeks retention intervals, respectively. Another subsample performed the 1-week retention test during functional MRI (fMRI). Memory retention was analyzed in relation to an educationally relevant composite score dividing participants into low, intermediate, and high cognitive-ability groups. We provide behavioral evidence that the testing effect is independent of cognitive ability. The fMRI findings confirmed a general effectiveness of retrieval practice by showing that brain regions associated with successful retrieval of conceptual representations and semantic processing were more strongly engaged after retrieval practice in all cognitive-ability groups. It is argued that the advantages of retrieval practice should be conveyed to all teachers and students.",

    "abstract": "Background: Findings from the testing effect literature suggest several ways to achieve testing effects in an authentic classroom, but few consider instructor workload, equity, and resources that determine feasibility and sustainability of testing effect methods in practice. Objective: To determine elements and procedures from the testing effect literature for practical application, devise a method for feasibly and sustainably implementing testing effect methods in practice, and determine if a simple way to incorporate retrieval practice into an existing introduction to psychology course was sufficient to observe testing effects. Method: Quiz scores of Introductory Psychology sections with and without retrieval practice were compared. Sections with retrieval practice also compared the effects of repeated and new questions on quiz performance. Results: Students with retrieval practice performed significantly better on quizzes than those without. Repeated and new retrieval practice were equally superior. Conclusion: Retrieval practices can successfully be implemented, feasibly and sustainably, in an authentic classroom environment. Retrieval practice questions can be related to delayed practice questions, rather than exact repeats, to achieve a testing effect. Teaching Implications: Distributing low stakes multiple-choice questions throughout lectures is effective for increasing test performance. The current method was neither burdensome to workload, content, or resources.",

    "abstract": "Midterm exams are a multi-use tool, providing evaluation of students for professors but also acting as a learning tool for students. Midterms may improve learning outcomes by contributing to the testing effect: the phenomenon in which retrieval of learned material (i.e., testing) produces improvements in long-term retention beyond those produced through additional rehearsal or re-exposure (i.e., studying or re-reading). Additionally, increased frequency of testing may impact student behaviors and attitudes (e.g., spaced practice, self-efficacy), increase the testing effect, or impact both, which ultimately improves learning outcomes. This study considered the differential impact of one versus two midterm exams on students' exam difference scores (final exam score minus first midterm exam score). We also considered whether two midterm exams differentially impacted low- and high-achieving students. Results suggest that two midterm exams benefit freshmen but not junior students.",

    "abstract": "All universities are concerned with students earning D's, F's, or withdrawing (DFW) from their courses, particularly in STEM and gateway courses. One way to reduce this rate is to improve the instructional practices in a course by introducing learning strategies, including spaced and interleaved retrieval practice in formative assessments. U-behavior, a learning and teaching method that includes a formative assessment to help guide students into optimal spaced and interleaved retrieval practice, was implemented in a course with a high DFW rate. In part, this method requires students to complete practice questions as a part of their retrieval practice. This paper describes how practice questions were developed to enhance students' retrieval practice using the U-behavior method, aiming to reduce the overall DFW rate. Data was gathered at the end of the semester and compared to previous semesters to better understand the impact of this effort. The data showed an overall reduction of the DFW rate by 14.7%. Additionally, students who spaced and interleaved at the highest level showed significant improvement on their final exam, suggesting the potential benefits of improving student performance.",

    "abstract": "Spaced and interleaved practices have been identified as effective learning strategies which sometimes are conflated as a single strategy and at other times treated as distinct. Learning sessions in which studying information or practicing problems are spaced in time with rest-from-deliberate-learning periods between sessions generally result in better learning outcomes than massed practice without rest-from-deliberate-learning periods. Interleaved practice also consists of spaced sessions, but by interleaving topics rather than having rest-from-deliberate-learning periods. Interleaving is usually contrasted with blocking in which each learning topic is taught in a single block that provides an example of massed practice. The general finding that interleaved practice is more effective for learning than blocked practice is sometimes attributed to spacing. In the current paper, the presence of rest-from-deliberate-learning periods is used to distinguish between spaced and interleaved practice. We suggest that spaced practice is a cognitive load effect that can be explained by working memory resource depletion during cognitive effort with recovery during rest-from-deliberate-learning, while interleaved practice can be explained by the discriminative-contrast hypothesis positing that interleaving assists learners to discriminate between topic areas. A systematic review of the literature provides evidence for this suggestion.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: Current evidence shows that children with developmental language disorder (DLD) benefit from spaced retrieval during word learning activities. Word recall is quite good relative to recall with alternative word learning procedures. However, recall on an absolute basis can be improved further; many studies report that fewer than two-thirds of the words are learned, even with the assistance of spaced retrieval during the learning activities. In this article we identify details of spaced retrieval that are less well understood in an effort to promote more effective learning through retrieval practice. Main contribution: We discuss the importance of factors such as: (a) integrating immediate retrieval with spaced retrieval trials; (b) determining whether gradual increases in spacing have more than short-term benefits relative to equal spacing; (c) discovering the number of successful retrievals sufficient to ensure later recall; (d) using spaced retrieval to avoid erosion of phonetic details on later recall tests; and (e) whether the well-documented difficulties with learning word forms might be tied to a particular subgroup of children with DLD. We also speculate on some of the possible reasons why spaced retrieval is beneficial in the first place. Conclusions: Although many children with DLD make gains in word learning through procedures that incorporate spaced retrieval, there are numerous details involved in the process that can alter its success. Until we have a better understanding of the boundaries of spaced retrieval's effectiveness, we will not be taking full advantage of this promising addition to word learning procedures. Implications: Spaced retrieval activities can be an important addition to the resources that clinicians and educators have available to assist children in their word learning. With a deeper understanding of the issues discussed here, we should be able to put spaced retrieval to even greater use.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval practice is a learning strategy that has repeatedly been found to have positive effects on memory and learning. However, studies indicate that students rarely use retrieval practice on a voluntary basis. The objective of the present study was to examine students' self-regulated use of retrieval practice, and to determine whether sex and individual differences in cognitive and non-cognitive aspects are related to optional use of practice testing. A classroom study was conducted with 146 upper-secondary school students taking courses in mathematics and Swedish. An ABAB design was used to compare students' optional and non-optional use of retrieval practice (i.e., repeated online quizzing). Students performed cognitive tasks to assess working memory capacity and fluid intelligence and completed self-reports of non-cognitive factors related to school achievement, such as grit, need for cognition (NFC), conscientiousness and openness. Quiz use was then compared using paired- and independent-samples t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression analyses explored relations to individual differences. The results showed that students completed significantly fewer quizzes in the optional sections than in the non-optional sections, and that females completed significantly more optional quizzes than males in Swedish, but not in mathematics. Further, the results showed that conscientiousness predicted optional quiz use in mathematics, whereas sex, NFC, conscientiousness, and openness predicted quiz use in Swedish. To conclude, although the findings show a relatively low optional/self-regulated use of practice testing, in line with earlier research, they suggest that sex and non-cognitive factors, such as personality characteristics, can predict optional use of practice testing.",

Using action phrases (i.e., &quot;squeeze the lemon&quot;) as learning material, we demonstrated the UWP effect after both verbal and enactive encoding, although we did not get first-cycle overconfidence. As predicted, participants exhibited underconfidence in Cycles 2 and 3, as an error of calibrations. However, people's resolution of JOLs (i.e., ability to discriminate recalled from unrecalled items) increased across study-test cycles. Importantly, JOLs for study-test (relative to study-study) items increased faster across cycles suggesting that repeated study-test practice not only produces underconfidence across cycles, but also reduces underconfidence relative to study-study practice. We discuss these findings in terms of current explanations of the underconfidence-with-practice effect.",

However, while the beneficial effect of testing on learning performances has been confirmed in a large body of literature, the question of exactly how testing influences cognitive and metacognitive processes remains unclear. We therefore set out to investigate the effect of testing on self-regulated learning (SRL) processes. We hypothesized that by recalibrating metacognitive monitoring, regular practice testing can trigger efficient SRL processes and, in turn, foster learning. To test this hypothesis, we exposed first-year undergraduates to a complex neurology module. Participants were randomly assigned to either the practice testing group or a control group. The testing group underwent multiple practice tests during the neurology module, whereas the control group only underwent the multiple practice tests after the course. To assess the impact of practice testing on SRL processes, we combined a think aloud protocol with a metacognitive monitoring self-report measure. Results showed that, compared with controls, participants in the practice testing group were significantly less overconfident in their ability to recall recently learned information and performed better on a posttest questionnaire. Furthermore, mediation analyses confirmed that enhanced learning performance was explained by the use of efficient SRL processes. Therefore, these results allow us to extend the testing effect to SRL, and empirically underscore the central role of monitoring in SRL. Contributions to the fields of practice testing and SRL are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Background: College students often do not retain what they learn in Statistics in order to apply it in Experimental Psychology. Self-explanation, that is, elaborating on what one is trying to learn by asking questions, making inferences, etc., improves learning and may improve retention. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether self-explanation was superior to students' usual study methods specifically for learning some basic concepts in statistics, and, if so, if it was similarly useful for retention a semester after the initial learning. Method: We used 199 college students as participants in a randomized, between participant, two-part experiment examining the effects of training by prompting self-explanations as a potential solution to this applied problem. Results: The self-explanations that we elicited improved initial learning and were superior to students' usual study methods, but did not benefit retention. Conclusions: Future research on improving the quality of the self-explanations and training with spaced retrieval practice, in order to benefit retention, is suggested. Teaching Implication: Self-explanation should be implemented for teaching statistics in order to benefit initial learning. However, teachers should explore other methods to accomplish retention.",

    "abstract": "We present a signal detection-like model termed the stochastic detection and retrieval model (SDRM) for use in studying metacognition. Focusing on paradigms that relate retrieval (e.g., recall or recognition) and confidence judgments, the SDRM measures (1) variance in the retrieval process, (2) variance in the confidence process, (3) the extent to which different sources of information underlie each response, (4) simple bias (i.e., increasing or decreasing confidence criteria across conditions), and (5) metacognitive bias (i.e., contraction or expansion of the confidence criteria across conditions). In the metacognition literature, gamma correlations have been used to measure the accuracy of confidence judgments. However, gamma cannot distinguish between the first 3 attributes, and it cannot measure either form of bias. In contrast, the SDRM can distinguish among the attributes, and it can measure both forms of bias. In this way, the SDRM can be used to test competing process theories by determining the attribute that best accounts for a change across conditions. To demonstrate the SDRM's usefulness, we investigated judgments of learning (JOLs) followed by cued-recall. Through a series of nested and non-nested model comparisons applied to a new experiment, the SDRM determined that a reduction in variance during the confidence process is the most likely explanation of the delayed-JOL effect, and a stronger relation between information underlying JOLs and recall is the most likely explanation of the testing-JOL effect. Following a brief discussion of implications for JOL theories, we conclude with a broader discussion of how the SDRM can benefit metacognition research.

    "abstract": "Spaced practice is a recognized effective study approach that fosters mastery of learning and retention of information. In this paper, we share one instructor's experience in introducing a spaced practice intervention in a large general chemistry course and in encouraging students to continue the strategy in the next semester organic chemistry course. The curricular implementation spanned two years during the COVID pandemic and encompassed the instructors' ongoing responsive efforts to enhance students' success. Student perspectives of the perceived value and their use of spaced practice varied with the instructor's conditions of the implementation. Offering spaced practice midway in a semester as an optional approach to homework garnered a positive student response and outcomes. However, moving to a required format for spaced practice in a subsequent semester resulted in much more mixed student feedback and outcomes. The instructor also encouraged and guided students in utilizing the strategy in the following organic chemistry course, and although over 70% of students planned to use it, only about a third actually persisted in the practice. When offering students effective study approaches through course design, instructors also have the challenge and opportunity to cultivate students' intrinsic motivation and self-regulation, skills that enhance their success more broadly. Instructors need to consider investing time in promoting and demonstrating the impact of the method on students' learning, nudging and encouraging students to persevere, and demonstrating metacognitive approaches to learning throughout the course to help students realize its rewards.",

    "abstract": "The authors examined whether individual differences in fluid intelligence (gF) modulate the testing effect. Participants studied Swahili--English word pairs and repeatedly studied half the pairs or attempted retrieval, with feedback, for the remaining half. Word pairs were easy or difficult to learn. Overall, participants showed a benefit of testing over restudy. However, almost 1/3 of the sample had a negative testing effect and benefitted more from restudy than testing, as well as performing better overall. These individuals self-reported less use of shallower encoding strategies than positive testing effect participants but did not differ in other dimensions. For individuals with a positive testing effect, difficulty had differential effects on participants who scored high or low on a measure of gF, with high gF participants showing larger testing effects for difficult over easy items, whereas low gF participants showed the opposite. Working memory performance was not related to the magnitude of the testing effect; however, vocabulary knowledge revealed a similar pattern as gF, with higher vocabulary associated with a testing effect for difficult but not easy items. This suggests that the benefit of retrieval practice varies with item difficulty and participant abilities. Thus, recommendations to engage in retrieval practice should take into consideration the interactive effects of to-be-learned materials and individual differences in the learners.",

    "abstract": "The type of a recall task may substantially influence the effects of learning by retrieval practice. In a within-subject design, 54 university students studied two expository texts, followed by retrieval practice with either short-answer tasks (targeted retrieval) or a free-recall task (holistic retrieval). Concerning the direct effects of retrieval practice, short-answer tasks led to increased retention of directly retrieved targeted information from the learning contents, whereas free-recall tasks led to better retention of further information from the learning contents. Concerning indirect effects, short-answer tasks improved metacognitive calibration; free-recall tasks increased self-efficacy and situational interest. These findings confirm the assumption that the effects of retrieval practice depend on the type of recall task: short-answer tasks help us remember targeted information units and foster metacognitive calibration. Free-recall tasks help us remember a broader spectrum of information, and they foster motivational factors.",

We hypothesized that providing students with digital flashcards via a spaced repetition app could improve academic performance by increasing use of spaced retrieval practice. In a controlled nationwide quasi-experiment, involving 799 first-year nursing students across 19 Norwegian campuses, we randomly assigned 10 campuses to an intervention. Although only one-third of the intervention group utilized the flashcards, evidence for self-selection bias was limited. Card users significantly outperformed non-users on the final exam (d = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), were nearly three times more likely to pass (OR = 2.84 [1.35, 6.01]), and over twice as likely to achieve the highest grade (OR = 2.31 [1.35, 3.98]). Flashcard use remained a significant predictor of exam performance after controlling for age, prior academic performance, study time, and study material covered. This suggests that teacher-made digital flashcards can be a cost-effective intervention to improve learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is mixed concerning whether delayed judgments of learning (JOLs) enhance learning and if so, whether their benefit is similar to retrieval practice. One potential explanation for the mixed findings is the truncated search hypothesis, which states that not all delayed JOLs lead to a full-blown covert retrieval attempt. In three paired-associate learning experiments, we examined the effect of delayed JOLs on later recall by comparing them to conditions of restudy, overt retrieval, and various other delayed JOL conditions. In Experiment 1, after an initial study phase, subjects either restudied word pairs, practiced overt retrieval, or made cue-only or cue-target delayed JOLs. In Experiments 2a and 2b, where conditions were manipulated within-subjects, subjects either restudied word pairs, practiced overt retrieval, made cue-only delayed JOLs, made cue-only delayed JOLs followed by a &quot;yes/no&quot; retrieval question or, in another condition, by an overt retrieval prompt. The final cued recall tests were delayed by two days. In Experiment 1, recall after cue-only delayed JOLs did not reliably differ from recall after overt retrieval or restudy. In Experiments 2a and 2b, delayed JOLs consistently produced poorer recall relative to overt retrieval. Furthermore, reaction times for delayed JOLs were shorter relative to delayed JOLs paired with overt retrieval prompts. We conclude that only some delayed JOLs elicit covert retrieval attempts, a pattern supporting the truncated search hypothesis.",

This difference in learning outcome is commonly called &quot;the testing effect&quot;. Yet there is little research on how individual differences in personality traits and working memory capacity moderate the size of the retrieval-practice benefits. The current study is a conceptual replication of a previous study, further investigating whether the testing effect is sensitive to individual differences in the personality traits Grit and Need for Cognition, and working memory capacity. Using a within-subjects design (N = 151), participants practiced 60 Swahili-Swedish word pairs (e.g., adhama-honor) through retrieval practice and re-studying. Learning was assessed at three time points: five minutes, one week, and four weeks after practice. The results revealed a significant testing effect at all three time points. Further, the results showed no association between the testing effect and the personality traits, or between the testing effect and working memory, at any time point. To conclude, retrieval practice seems to be a learning technique that is not moderated by individual differences in these specific personality traits or with working memory capacity, thus possibly beneficial for all students.",

First, Van Gog and Sweller's idea of &quot;element interactivity&quot; is not defined in a quantitative, measurable way. As a consequence, the idea is applied inconsistently in their literature review. Second, none of the experiments on retrieval practice with worked-example materials manipulated element interactivity. Third, Van Gog and Sweller's literature review omitted several studies that have shown retrieval practice effects with complex materials, including studies that directly manipulated the complexity of the materials. Fourth, the experiments that did not show retrieval practice effects, which were emphasized by Van Gog and Sweller, either involved retrieval of isolated words in individual sentences or required immediate, massed retrieval practice. The experiments failed to observe retrieval practice effects because of the retrieval tasks, not because of the complexity of the materials. Finally, even though the worked-example experiments emphasized by Van Gog and Sweller have methodological problems, they do not show strong evidence favoring the null. Instead, the data provide evidence that there is indeed a small positive effect of retrieval practice with worked examples. Retrieval practice remains an effective way to improve meaningful learning of complex materials.",

This facilitative effect of retrieval practice on subsequent encoding is known as &quot;test-potentiated learning.&quot; Thus far, however, the literature has not isolated the indirect effect of retrieval practice on subsequent memory (via enhancing the effectiveness of restudy) from the direct effects of retrieval on subsequent memory. The experiment presented here uses conditional probability to disentangle test-potentiated learning from the direct effects of retrieval practice. The results indicate that unsuccessful retrieval attempts enhance the effectiveness of subsequent restudy, demonstrating that tests do potentiate subsequent learning.",

However, little research has investigated means to enhance this effect in educational settings. Theoretical accounts assume retrieval practice to be the most effective whenever retrieval is difficult but successful. Therefore, we developed a novel retrieval practice procedure, which adapts to learners' abilities and can be applied irrespective of learning content. This adaptive procedure aims to make retrieval gradually easier whenever students provide an incorrect answer. In a field experiment, students read book chapters as part of a weekly university course. In three consecutive weeks, they then practiced reading assignments by (a) adaptive testing, (b) non-adaptive testing and (c) restudy. In Week 4, a surprise criterial test took place. Restudy outperformed both testing conditions, whereas adaptive testing performed equally well as non-adaptive testing. However, exploratory analyses revealed that with increasing retention intervals, the superiority of restudy disappeared. Furthermore, whenever participants fully read the assignments and retention intervals increased, adaptive testing outperformed non-adaptive testing. In sum, adaptive retrieval practice did not prove to be generally superior, but retention interval and students' preparation for class might be conditions rendering adaptive retrieval useful in educational settings.",

The current experiments evaluated the efficacy of a minimal intervention aimed at improving students' self-regulated use of repeated retrieval practice. Across 2 experiments, students made decisions about when to study, engage in retrieval practice, or stop learning a set of foreign language word pairs. Some students received direct instruction about how to use repeated retrieval practice. These instructions emphasized the mnemonic benefits of retrieval practice over a less effective strategy (restudying) and told students how to use repeated retrieval practice to maximize their performance--specifically, that they should recall a translation correctly 3 times during learning. This minimal intervention promoted more effective self-regulated use of retrieval practice and better retention of the translations compared to a control group that received no instruction. Students who experienced this intervention also showed potential for long-term changes in self-regulated learning: They spontaneously used repeated retrieval practice 1 week later to learn new materials. These results provide a promising first step for developing guidelines for teaching students how to regulate their learning more effectively using repeated retrieval practice.",

In a within-subjects design, N = 180 students completed an intermediate knowledge test in the 9th session and a final test in the 13th session of the semester. Both tests assessed students' correctness of answering and confidence in their answers. In the final test, items that were intermediately tested were answered as correctly as items that were not intermediately tested. The failure to find a testing effect at the level of cognitive performance could not be attributed to interference with item difficulty, as intermediately tested and not tested items were balanced according to their a priori difficulty. However, testing improved performance at the metacognitive level. Confidence ratings were more accurate and less biased in items that were intermediately tested compared to items not intermediately tested. The results are discussed in the context of metacognitive monitoring as a condition of self-regulated learning in an authentic psychology learning context.",

    "abstract": "We performed 4 experiments assessing the learning that occurs when taking a test. Our experiments used multiple-choice tests because the processes deployed during testing can be manipulated by varying the nature of the choice alternatives. Previous research revealed that a multiple-choice test that includes &quot;none of the above&quot; (NOTA) produces better performance on a subsequent test only when the correct answer is something other than NOTA (Odegard &amp; Koen, 2007). However, when NOTA was an incorrect choice alternative, the correct answer was the only familiar alternative. Thus, familiarity may have allowed participants to identify the answer, which was then restudied. In other words, the testing benefit might have reflected a familiarity-guided restudy process rather than retrieval practice. In the current study, we examined the role of familiarity in the multiple-choice testing effect, manipulating the familiarity of alternatives. If NOTA was the correct answer, there was no testing benefit when the alternatives were all novel (Experiment 1) or all familiar (Experiment 3). Familiarity-guided restudy predicts memory impairment when there is a single familiar alternative for a NOTA-correct question. In contradiction to this hypothesis, there was a testing benefit for this condition (Experiments 2 and 4). Experiment 4 further collected metacognitive confidence ratings during the multiple-choice test, providing evidence of a recall-to-reject strategy for this condition. These results suggest that learning from multiple-choice tests is mainly due to retrieval practice rather than the use of familiarity.",

    "abstract": "Memory retrieval affects subsequent memory in ways both positive (e.g., the testing effect) and negative (e.g., retrieval-induced forgetting, RIF). The changes to memory that retrieval produces can be thought of as the encoding consequences of retrieval, examined here with respect to attention. In three experiments, participants first studied category--example word pairs, and then practiced retrieval for half the pairs from one-third of the categories (the R+ items) and restudied half the pairs from a different third of the categories (the S+ items), while the final third of the categories were in the nonpracticed control condition (the Np items). This was followed in turn by a final test over all categories and examples, including the unpracticed examples from the retrieval-practice and restudied categories (the R- and S- items, respectively). The middle phase (of retrieval practice and restudy) was conducted under full attention (FA) or under divided attention (DA) in which participants also performed a distracting secondary task. DA had little effect on final recall in the retrieval practice (R+) condition but significantly reduced final recall of the restudied (S+) items, producing a net increase in the testing effect relative to the FA condition. RIF (measured as the difference between the R- and Np items) was substantial in the FA condition but was eliminated by DA. This occurred because the final recall of R- items significantly increased in the DA compared to FA condition, a highly unusual result in which distraction actually improved an aspect of memory performance. In sum, DA during retrieval practice dissociated the positive and negative effects of retrieval on subsequent memory, increasing the positive effect, embodied by the testing effect, but decreasing the negative effect, embodied by RIF. The theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Successive relearning involves repeated retrieval practice of the same information (with feedback) over multiple, spaced sessions. We implemented successive relearning in an introductory psychology class to explore potential learning benefits. After each weekly lecture, students were sent links via e-mail to engage in three learning practice sessions, each separated by 2 days. Half the students engaged in successive relearning (&quot;relearn&quot; condition), answering 20 fill-in-the-blank questions with corrective feedback. Within each session, correctly answered questions were dropped, whereas incorrectly answered questions were presented up to two more times. The other half of students restudied the same 20 sentences without blanks twice per session (&quot;restudy&quot; condition). Unlike previous research, we controlled the exposure duration of the learning materials between the relearn and restudy conditions. Learning practice sessions continued throughout the remaining 10 weeks of the semester, with students alternating each week between the relearning and restudying tasks. Recall of course material at the end of the semester was better for relearning compared with restudying. Increased recall during relearning sessions was associated with further learning benefits including improved metacognition, increased self-reported sense of mastery, increased attentional control, and reduced anxiety. Individual differences were not associated with the benefit of relearning over restudying in the retention tests. Qualitative feedback indicated that students found successive relearning to be enjoyable and valuable. Our research indicates that successive relearning is a valuable addition to any university course and is easy to implement using digital resources.",

    "abstract": "Self-explanation, a learning strategy where students explain to themselves the steps taken in a worked example, is an effective learning strategy in early cognitive skill acquisition. However, many physics students produce self-explanations of low quality. There is also a lack of guidelines for what students should seek to explain when studying worked examples. Therefore, the overarching purpose of this article is to investigate how we can improve students' self-explanations of worked examples. We pursue the following two general research questions: (1) What knowledge representations should students seek while self-explaining worked examples to maximize their learning? (2) Can retrieval practice of physics principles and their conditions of application potentiate students' learning from self-explaining worked examples? In two studies (n = 18 and N = 54), we qualitatively categorized and quantified the students' written self-explanations. Our results indicate that to produce useful knowledge, self-explanations of the physics model in worked examples should explain what principle is used, how the principle is set up, and how the conditions of application are met for the principle, while explanations of the mathematical procedures should contain action descriptions, goals, and conditions (r = 0.30-0.50). Through a quasiexperimental (N = 57) and an experimental (N = 54) test, we found evidence that retrieval practice of physics principles and their conditions of application before self-explanation can have a medium-sized effect on post-test problem-solving scores and that it can increase the quality of students' self-explanations. Using retrieval practice to potentiate learning from more complex learning strategies is a novel and promising approach to improve physics students' learning.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the relation between mind wandering and the spacing effect in inductive learning. Participants studied works of art by different artists grouped in blocks, where works by a particular artist were either presented all together successively (the massed condition), or interleaved with the works of other artists (the spaced condition). The works of 24 artists were shown, with 12, 15, or 18 works by each artist being provided as exemplars. Later, different works by the same artists were presented for a test of the artists' identity. During the course of studying these works, participants were probed for mind wandering. It was found that people mind wandered more when the exemplars were presented in a massed rather than in a spaced manner, especially as the task progressed. There was little mind wandering and little difference between massed and spaced conditions toward the beginning of study. People were better able to correctly attribute the new works to the appropriate artist (inductive learning) when (a) they were in the spaced condition and (b) they had not been mind wandering. This research suggests that inductive learning may be influenced by mind wandering and that the impairment in learning with massed practice (compared to spaced practice) may be attributable, at least in part, to attentional factors--people are &quot;on task&quot; less fully when the stimuli are massed rather than spaced.",

Applying various intervention design principles that leverage sociomotivational research, we created an intervention targeted not only at teaching students about the efficacy of retrieval practice, but also at changing their study behaviors. We focused on increasing students' understanding of how to implement retrieval practice effectively and decreasing their perceived cost of using retrieval practice. We found that our intervention increased students' procedural metacognitive knowledge (that retrieval practice can be implemented flexibly in various formats) and intended use of retrieval practice, but it did not reduce perceived cost (that engaging in retrieval practice costs too much time and effort), as compared to a traditional retrieval practice intervention. There were also no effects of our intervention on reported use of retrieval practice. Furthermore, results from a structural equation model analysis showed that self-efficacy of procedural metacognitive knowledge was positively associated with students' intended use of the strategy, whereas perceived cost was negatively associated with their reported use of the strategy. Alleviating perceived cost could be a potential venue for future intervention aimed at encouraging the self-regulated use of retrieval practice.",

    "abstract": "African Americans have suffered many negative consequences as a result of racism. African Americans are currently underperforming their White counterparts in the field of Mathematics. Several examples have indicated that the appropriate use of resources can significantly affect this gap in performance. The concepts of deep study and spaced retrieval practice have been shown in several situations to have positive effects on student's academic outcomes. This study educated African Americans students on these two concepts. The study found that students had little knowledge of spaced retrieval practice and approaches to study. There are many obstacles to students using these methods, like the timing of due dates of assignments. Participants made rational decisions on when and how to use the deep and surface approach to study. The study suggests that institutions should assess the knowledge of spaced retrieval practice and approach to study of incoming students and address any deficiencies. There is more to learn about the study process. This paper presents a five stage study process. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "abstract": "The testing effect--the power of retrieval practice to enhance long-term knowledge retention more than restudying does--is a well-known phenomenon in learning. However, retrieval practice is hardly appreciated by students and underutilized when studying. One of the reasons is that learners usually do not experience immediate benefits of such practice which often present only after a delay. We therefore conducted 2 experiments to examine whether students choose retrieval practice more often as their learning strategy after having experienced its benefits. In Experiment 1, students received individual feedback about the extent to which their 7-day delayed test scores after retrieval practice differed from their test scores after restudy. Those students who had actually experienced the benefits of retrieval practice appreciated the strategy more and used it more often after receiving feedback. In Experiment 2, we compared the short-term and long-term effects on retrieval practice use of individual performance feedback and general instruction about the testing effect. Although both interventions enhanced its use in the short term, only the individual feedback led to enhanced use in the long term by those who had actually experienced its benefits, demonstrating the superiority of the individual feedback in terms of its ability to promote retrieval practice use.",

Although this has been true for learning new verbs as well as new nouns and adjectives, these children's overall verb learning has remained quite low. In this preregistered study, we presented novel verbs in transitive sentences with varying subjects/agents and objects/patients to determine if recall could be improved and if retrieval practice continued to be facilitative. Method: Fourteen children with DLD aged 4--5 years and 13 same-age peers with typical language development (TD) learned eight novel verbs over two sessions. Half of the novel verbs were presented with spacing between study and retrieval trials, and half were presented with the same frequency in study trials without the opportunity for retrieval. All novel verbs were presented in sentences such as, &quot;The woman is deeking the shoe.&quot; Children's ability to recall and use the novel verbs in the same sentence structure was tested after the second session and 1 week later. The children were also required to use the novel verbs in bare-stem form in a new structure, as in, &quot;That woman likes to deek the towel.&quot; Results: Both groups of children showed increased recall relative to a previous novel verb study. The children with TD showed the expected advantages of spaced retrieval over repeated study and could use the novel verbs in the new morphological form and sentence structure. The children with DLD, however, showed an advantage for spaced retrieval only shortly after the learning period. These children had great difficulty changing the novel verbs to a bare stem and using them in a new structure. Conclusion: Although spaced retrieval assists children's novel verb recall, children with DLD in particular require additional help using these verbs with morphological and syntactic flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval practice relative to restudy of learned material typically attenuates time-dependent forgetting. A recent study examining this testing effect across 12-h delays filled with nocturnal sleep versus daytime wakefulness, however, showed that sleep directly following encoding benefited recall of restudied but not of retrieval practiced items, which reduced, and even eliminated, the testing effect after sleep (Bäuml, Holterman, &amp; Abel, 2014). The present study investigated, in 4 experiments, whether this modulating role of sleep for the testing effect is influenced by two factors that have previously been shown to increase the testing effect: corrective feedback and prolonged retention intervals. Experiments 1a and 1b applied 12-h delays and showed benefits of sleep for recall after both restudy and retrieval practice with feedback, but not after retrieval practice without feedback. Experiments 2a and 2b applied 24-h or 7-day delays and failed to observe any long-lasting benefits of sleep directly after encoding, on both restudied and retrieval practiced items. These results indicate that both corrective feedback and prolonged retention intervals reduce the modulating role of sleep for the testing effect as it can be observed after 12-h delays and in the absence of corrective feedback, which suggests a fairly limited influence of sleep on the effect.",

In two experiments, we examined retrieval practice and restudy of Swahili-Swedish word pairs in relation to individual differences in Grit and NFC. In Experiment 1, using a between-subjects design, a significant main effect of retention interval was qualified by a Group Retention Interval interaction. However, there were no effects of Grit or NFC. In Experiment 2, a within-subjects design was used, and a measure of WMC was included. The analyses revealed a testing effect; but again, WMC, Grit, and NFC were not significantly associated with performance.

    "abstract": "The application of knowledge to new contexts (i.e., transfer) is a central aim of learning processes and has become a new focus of testing effect research. In a quasi-experimental design, we investigated the transfer of retrieval practice effects on English vocabulary learning on eighth-grade students (N = 182) by applying a typical testing effect study paradigm including study, initial test or restudy, and final test. The final test comprised four test formats, one identical to the initial test (non-transfer context), and three deviating from the initial test (transfer context). Comparing testing and restudy conditions yielded a significant multivariate effect of testing across all final test formats and significant univariate effects in three of the four test formats. Comparing transfer and non-transfer contexts revealed smaller retrieval practice effects when transfer was required. The results are discussed against the theoretical background of transfer-appropriate-processing, elaborative retrieval, and a distribution-based model of retrieval.",

Overall, frequent deadlines enhanced distribution of practice and improved learning. Students with less control over pace (in groups with weekly deadlines) spaced their study episodes to a greater extent than their peers with more control over pace (in groups with monthly and end-of-course deadlines). Online learning experience and technology self-efficacy did not explain practice distribution effects. Student perceptions of control over how, when and in which order they learn did not differ significantly across experimental groups. However, perceived control and spaced practice were positively and significantly related to performance on tests of short delayed retention and near transfer. In addition, perceived control and spaced practice predicted performance on a test of delayed retention and far transfer. Locus of control did not explain differences in performance.

    "abstract": "The benefits of retrieval practice (practice testing) are pervasive across various materials, learning conditions, and criterial tasks, and consequently researchers and educators have enthusiastically recommended retrieval practice for educational applications. Less research has been devoted to examining the effect of combining retrieval practice with other evidence-based learning strategies; this article focuses on an emerging literature that examines the outcomes of combining potent elaborative encoding methods with retrieval practice. Theoretically, several possibilities can be identified. Augmenting retrieval practice with effective encoding strategies could significantly improve learning relative to retrieval practice alone through complementary mechanisms of each or through effective encoding catalyzing retrieval practice effects. Alternatively, effective encoding combined with retrieval practice might not improve learning (relative to retrieval practice alone), because the processing produced by elaborative encoding strategies is overly redundant with those promoted by retrieval practice. The extant literature, which has focused on everyday learning tasks (e.g., name learning) and educationally relevant tasks ranging from learning of arbitrary associations (e.g., new vocabulary meanings) to learning from connected discourse, is reviewed, and helps inform these possibilities. The findings largely converge on the conclusion that incorporating elaborative encoding techniques with retrieval practice prior to, but not concurrent with, retrieval practice provides a boost for learning and retention.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the effects of a classroom intervention on students' metacognitive monitoring of retrieval practice performance feedback and metacognitive control of future study decisions. A true experimental design was used to randomly assign 103 undergraduate students from an education course to trained (n = 49) and control (n = 54) conditions. The primary goals of this work were to examine whether training metacognitive monitoring and control skills for retrieval practice increases students' academic performance, their independent use of practice-testing, and the accuracy of the metacognitive monitoring judgments they make based on external feedback. During the semester, students completed a pre- and postmetacognitive awareness inventory (MAI), 10 practice-tests, 10 feedback monitoring assignments, and a cumulative final examination. The feedback assignments required students to identify areas of mastery (i.e., well-learned topics) and areas of weakness (i.e., yet-to-be-learned topics). In addition, students were asked to monitor the effectiveness of their current strategies (i.e., monitoring strategy use) and to select a study strategy for their examination preparation (i.e., control strategy decisions). Students who completed the metacognitive retrieval practice training scored higher on final exam items that were not previously quizzed, compared with the control group. In an overall mediation model, when all of the relations among metacognitive, control, and outcome variables were examined simultaneously, yet-to-be-learned monitoring accuracy had the strongest indirect effect of training on final examination performance for nonquizzed items. These findings suggest that monitoring feedback accurately from practice-tests is important and can be improved with training.",

Objective: This study examines the associations between self-reported exam score and study techniques among students in two courses, Introductory Psychology and Computer Science. Method: We used an online survey to measure the extent students (N = 249) used 10 techniques studied in cognitive science. We also measured students' perseverance, metacognitive skill, distractions, and procrastination. Results: Student use of specific study techniques varied between the two courses and a high utility technique, practice testing, was well used. Students reported low levels of spaced practice. Perseverance and metacognitive skills both correlated significantly with many of the study techniques. While no study techniques predicted exam scores in Introductory Psychology beyond variance predicted by GPA, the use of spaced practice predicted a significant portion of variance in students in Computer Science. Conclusions: Students' use of study techniques varies between their courses and while related to GPA and exam scores, are not unique predictors of variance in learning. Additional moderators and mediators of learning need to be identified. Teaching Implications: We discuss ways instructors can help prepare students in Introductory Psychology and key needs for future research on studying.",

We hypothesized that an effect similar to this forward testing effect would also occur when making judgments of (prior) learning (JOLs). Previous research showed that making JOLs likely prompts covert retrieval attempts and thereby enhances memory, specifically when providing only parts of previously studied information. This study examined the forward effect of different types of JOLs (i.e., with complete or partial prior study information available) on subsequent learning of new materials, compared to restudy and retrieval practice. In a between-subjects design, participants (N = 161) consecutively studied five lists of 20 words with the aim to recall as many of them on a final cumulative recall test. After the presentation of each of the first four lists, participants either restudied the list, made JOLs with complete words, made JOLs with word stems, or they were tested on word stems. Compared to restudy, practicing retrieval and making JOLs with word stems, but not JOLs with complete words, facilitated the List-5 interim recall performance and attenuated the number of intrusions from prior lists. The findings suggest that, similar to overt retrieval, making JOLs with incomplete information can enhance new learning to the extent that it elicits covert retrieval attempts.",

In two experiments, we investigated whether retrieval practice, known to foster lasting knowledge acquisition, is a useful tool for (1) increasing environmental knowledge and (2) for improving environmental attitudes and behaviour (i.e., spillover effect). Participants studied a text on the effects of online streaming behaviour by means of retrieval practice or by copying the text. Knowledge gain was assessed after one (Experiment 1) and two weeks (Experiment 2). Attitudes and behaviour were assessed pre- and post-intervention. In both experiments, participants recalled more environmental knowledge after retrieval practice compared to copying. Attitudes and behaviour did not differ between both groups, but attitudes increased after the intervention in both groups. Only Experiment 1 showed declining streaming times. Our findings suggest that retrieval practice enhances lasting knowledge acquisition but barely affects environmental attitudes and behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The approach that students take in their studies at university is critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in life-long learning for their career and professional development. Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material. Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term compared to 'cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years, suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing interest in spaced retrieval methods, a research gap has been discovered, with insufficient data to support best practises in year-one science. After analysing five systematic action cycles, four interrelated themes emerged: dual coding, cognitive load, peer communication, and feedback-driven metacognition. While literature emphasises the need to take a child's cognitive load into account, the themes of peer communication and dual coding provoked debate among participants. Despite this conflict, an agreement was reached on how limited reading abilities affect retrieval practise. While this small-scale study cannot draw definitive conclusions, I discovered that by optimising cognitive load, teachers can ensure that a task is desirably difficult using dual coding, discussion, and feedback-driven metacognition, all of which contributed to the success of knowledge acquisition methodologies. According to my research, ensuring a retrieval task is challenging, increases children's development of retention of scientific knowledge. However, minimising literacy constraints is critical to avoid thinking being exhausted by writing or reading, rather than recalling and applying. Consequently, the relevance of the study for education and society is illustrated by the findings, which emphasise the necessity to reduce extraneous load (reading and writing) during retrieval tasks and propose potential solutions to this issue.",

Practicing retrieval from long-term memory (e.g., practice tests or flashcards) is a particularly effective study strategy that can provide large learning benefits; yet, students rarely recognize the benefits of retrieval practice. Here, we examine whether a sample of middle and high school students report using retrieval practice when studying on their own, why they use it, and whether its use varies by age and learning domain. The results show that most middle and high school students in our sample report using retrieval practice, but students utilize re-reading strategies more. The high school students in our sample report using retrieval practice more than the surveyed middle school students, and this may be driven by differences in their reasoning for using it. Finally, students' ages and learning domains interact to affect how widely retrieval practice is utilized. Students' use of retrieval practice grows with age and changes by domain. While more students report using retrieval practice than in prior literature, many students still fail to fully harness the learning benefits that retrieval practice can provide.",

Divided attention (DA) is known to produce different effects on encoding and retrieval, substantially disrupting the former and often producing little effect on the latter. The present experiments examine whether the mnemonic consequences of retrieval are similarly resilient in the face of distraction or if they have a similar sensitivity to DA as study-based encoding. In 2 experiments, participants initially studied a set of word pairs (Phase 1) then engaged in restudy of some pairs and retrieval practice of others (Phase 2), followed by either an immediate or (24-hr) delayed final cued-recall test (Phase 3). Phase 2 restudy and retrieval practice occurred under full attention (FA) or DA. Phase 2 performance replicated earlier research in finding little effect of DA on retrieval success, and greater disruption to the secondary task in the retrieval than restudy condition. More importantly, the testing effect on the final test (the difference between the retrieval and restudy conditions) was greater in the DA than FA condition. Final recall was substantially reduced by DA in the restudy condition but not in the retrieval condition. This pattern was found for related and unrelated word pairs, with feedback during retrieval practice and without, for immediate as well as delayed final tests, and for high as well as low performance on the secondary task. The encoding effects of retrieval appear to be more resilient in the face of distraction than the encoding effects of restudy.",

Despite this, there is limited evidence on how residents practically implement SDL strategies, particularly within the cognitive load theory framework. <b>Objective</b> To investigate how internal medicine residents participate in SDL within an academic coaching program, focusing on how strategies align with cognitive load theory. <b>Methods</b> This qualitative study occurred in a single internal medicine residency program with a formal, longitudinal academic coaching curriculum. In October 2023, we conducted semistructured interviews with participating residents. We purposefully selected 16 of the 27 eligible residents (59%) and conducted semistructured interviews until we reached thematic sufficiency. We reanalyzed these transcripts using thematic analysis to identify SDL behaviors and resource utilization patterns. <b>Results</b> Three key themes emerged: (1) personalization and structure in learning: residents developed individualized, goal-oriented learning plans; (2) diverse learning strategies with emphasis on retrieval practice: residents frequently engaged in active recall and multimodal resource integration; and (3) deliberate repetition and spaced learning for retention: residents intentionally used repetition and temporal spacing to consolidate knowledge. <b>Conclusions</b> Internal medicine residents employ structured, cognitively informed SDL strategies when provided with academic coaching support.",

Ideally, if a person believes they are capable of completing a task, they should do so themselves; otherwise, the task should be delegated to the other party. Such delegation decisions are influenced by individuals' assessments of their own abilities, which are shaped by metacognition-the capacity to evaluate one's own capacities. High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technology that can regulate the excitability of the cerebral cortex to improve human performance. This protocol presents a method that employs HD-tDCS to investigate its effects on human metacognition during human-AI delegation tasks, detailing the procedure for applying anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Stimulation was performed using a portable HD-tDCS device, using a circumferential arrangement of five electrodes, including one target electrode and four return electrodes. The stimulation lasted for a total of 21 min, and the current intensity was 2 mA. This method is expected to provide a new research path for further in-depth exploration of the neural mechanisms and behavioral regulation of humans in the process of human-AI collaborative task delegation and provide a solid theoretical basis for further optimizing human-AI collaborative tasks.",

    "abstract": "Active goal setting and metacognition are components of self-regulated learning, helping medical students thrive in high-pressure environments. To support self-regulated learning and well-being, we must better understand the types of goals medical students set, how they formulate goals, their metacognitive awareness of goal setting and how these factors impact well-being. The overarching objective of this study is to explore how medical students develop goal-setting behaviours and abilities. We also characterised their metacognitive ability around goal setting and probed how they felt their behaviours impacted well-being. In this qualitative reflexive thematic analysis study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 medical students in all years from 6 Canadian medical schools. The study received ethics approval. Our analysis revealed three major themes around goal-setting behaviours, student metacognition and implications: (1) Students have limited awareness of their goal-setting process, preferences and the associated consequences. (2) Students' goal-setting tendencies and processes can be described by goal-setting scripts-flexible or concrete. (3) Goal-setting scripts are modified in response to external factors, occasionally leading to approaches that may be incongruent with a student's preferred goal-setting style. This research offers important insight into goal-setting behaviours of medical students. Flexible and concrete goal-setting scripts introduce another framework through which educators and learners alike can examine and reflect upon goal-setting strategies. Implications of the scripts being modified due to external drivers need to be considered to support learners. Students have limited awareness and purposiveness around their goal-setting behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes poses a significant global health threat due to its increasing prevalence and associated comorbidities, straining healthcare systems worldwide. Depression and anxiety are frequent comorbidities in individuals with diabetes, and their underlying mechanisms have been a subject of research. This study investigated the influence of metacognitions and metacognitions about symptom control (MaSC) on depression and anxiety in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), specifically examining their effects beyond illness representations. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study involved 153 T2D patients. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ), Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Metacognitions about Symptom Control Scale-Revised (MaSCS-R), and the Protection Motivation Theory Scale for COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that after controlling for socio-demographic variables, fear of COVID-19, and illness representations, negative metacognitions about symptom control predicted 2% of anxiety and 4% of depression; metacognitions predicted 10% of anxiety and 9% of depression. Metacognitions predicted both depression and anxiety, supporting the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model. Metacognitive therapy could be an alternative for managing emotional distress in T2D patients and may contribute to future research.",

    "abstract": "Theory of mind (ToM) is a foundational ability for social functioning and interpersonal relationships. This study aims to examine theory of mind components in major depressive disorder and its relationship with metacognitive functions and attachment styles. The study enrolled 64 patients with major depressive disorder and 64 healthy controls. The control group was selected to match the patient group regarding age, gender, marital status, and educational level. Every participant completed the sociodemographic data form, the Hinting Test, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, the Adult Attachment Style Scale, and the Metacognition Questionnaire. The severity of depression symptoms was evaluated using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17. The average overall score of the metacognition questionnaire was substantially greater in the patient group (p&amp;lt;0.001) compared to the control group. The average score for the Hinting Task was substantially lower in the patients compared to the control group (p&amp;lt;0.001). The severity of depressive symptoms showed a strong negative correlation with the Hinting Task score (r=-0.759; p&amp;lt;0.001), and a moderate negative correlation with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test score (r=-0.589; p&amp;lt;0.001). This study showed that depressed individuals have impairments in reading the minds of others&amp;rsquo; around them and in their metacognitive functions. The findings above highlight the need to integrate techniques centered on enhancing fundamental theory of mind reasoning into current therapy interventions in order to enhance the comprehension and interpretation of social information among individuals experiencing depression.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are transforming educational settings by offering tools that enhance learning experiences. AI-powered applications, such as ChatGPT and Poe, provide real-time assistance, fostering learner autonomy and self-determined motivation. However, limited research has explored their impact on undergraduate students' learning strategies and motivation. This study investigates the effectiveness of AI-powered educational applications in enhancing metacognitive and social learning strategies, as well as self-determined motivation, among Chinese undergraduate students. This mixed-methods quasi-experimental study involved 310 undergraduates (45% female, 55% male; M age&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) at the Criminal Investigation Police University of China. Participants were assigned to an AI-integrated experimental group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;139) or a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;171). Validated questionnaires assessed metacognitive/social strategies (SILL) and autonomous motivation (RAI). Qualitative data from 834 reflective journals were thematically analyzed. ANCOVA was used to compare post-test outcomes, controlling for pre-test scores, while journals provided experiential insights. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study investigated the impact of AI-integrated instruction on metacognitive strategies, social strategies, and motivation in 310 undergraduate students. ANCOVA revealed significant improvements in the AI group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), with large effect sizes observed for metacognition (&#x3b7;&#xb2; = 0.39) and motivation (&#x3b7;&#xb2; = 0.31), which are large effect sizes according to Cohen's benchmarks. Qualitative analysis of 834 journals highlighted themes of autonomy, support for metacognitive strategies, and reduced anxiety, although risks of superficial application were noted. Mixed methods confirmed AI's effectiveness in enhancing strategic learning. AI applications facilitate independent academic exploration and enhance learners' motivation by providing immediate support and personalized learning experiences. These findings highlight the potential of AI-powered tools to foster learner autonomy. However, successful integration into educational settings requires strategic pedagogical approaches to maximize benefits while addressing potential challenges.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that individuals with low self-esteem tend to undervalue themselves, a tendency that may reflect a metacognitive monitoring bias, which in turn can be shaped by feedback valence. However, research specifically exploring how self-esteem and feedback valence affect metacognitive monitoring remains scarce. Through three experiments, the study revealed that individuals tend to exhibit an underestimation bias in perceptual metacognitive monitoring. However, compared to individuals with high self-esteem, those with low self-esteem exhibited more pronounced local and global monitoring biases in the absence of feedback. Furthermore, feedback valence influenced both local and global metacognitive monitoring in low self-esteem individuals, whereas its effects in high self-esteem individuals were limited to global monitoring. Additionally, feedback valence reduced global monitoring disparities between self-esteem groups, while only positive feedback narrowed the gap in local monitoring. These findings suggest that the influence of feedback valence on metacognitive monitoring biases varies depending on both self-esteem level and the level of monitoring. These results provide valuable insights into the interplay among self-esteem, metacognitive monitoring and feedback, with implications for the development of targeted educational strategies, particularly for individuals with low self-esteem.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mimic human cognition in various language-based tasks. However, their capacity for metacognition-particularly in predicting memory performance-remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a cross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with human judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals predict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs of sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence-a sentence that initially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before requiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting sentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM and human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted actual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy. This discrepancy emerged regardless of whether sentences appeared in fitting or unfitting contexts. These findings indicate that, despite LLMs' demonstrated capacity to model human cognition at the object-level, they struggle at the meta-level, failing to capture the variability in individual memory predictions. By identifying this shortcoming, our study underscores the need for further refinements in LLMs' self-monitoring abilities, which could enhance their utility in educational settings, personalized learning, and human-AI interactions. Strengthening LLMs' metacognitive performance may reduce the reliance on human oversight, paving the way for more autonomous and seamless integration of AI into tasks requiring deeper cognitive awareness.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine how older adults form beliefs about their memory and how these beliefs are influenced by their level of concern about dementia. Inaccurate beliefs and excessive worrying, indicative of erroneous metacognition, are associated with negative health outcomes. This research can help identify mitigation for these harmful effects. Qualitative focus groups; thematic analysis. Focus group discussion with healthy older adults hosted at a university in central London. 35 healthy older individuals (women=29) without any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, over the age of 65 years (mean 75.31, SD: 6.15). 13 participants were identified as having a high level of worry about dementia and 22 as having low worry. Groups were matched for cognitive performance on the Telephone Mini Addenbrooke's cognitive assessment (Tele-MACE). Participants were assigned to a focus group depending on their level of worry about dementia. During focus groups, a vignette prompted discussion around lifespan changes in memory and how this affected concerns around memory. This allowed investigation of the differences in beliefs about memory. Thematic analysis revealed two key themes. First, older adults appear to base their definition of 'normality' of their own memory on comparisons. These comparisons were between themselves and others and between themselves now and their own past self. Despite similar strategies to define 'normality', those with high dementia worry had stricter definitions of what they determined as normal. The second theme described narratives around the 'self' and the 'other'. There was a difference between those with high versus low worry; those with high worry had a strong focus on the 'self', while those with low dementia worry focused on 'others'. Comparison is a common metacognitive strategy used in forming beliefs about memory. Targeting the use of comparison is potentially valuable in interventions aiming to alleviate older adults' memory concerns. Addressing self-focused thinking, for example, with cognitive behavioural therapy, could improve harmful levels of high worry.",

    "abstract": "Self-reported outcome measures are rarely described in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we investigated the effect of computerized working memory training on self- and relatives reported executive function measures. A total of 50 individuals with MCI were recruited from five memory clinics in Southern Norway and underwent a 5-week/20-25 sessions computerized working memory training program. Both individuals and relatives scored the \"Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults\" (BRIEF-A) before, and at least four months after finalizing training. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and mixed ANOVA with rater type (participant/informant) and time (baseline/4-months). Mixed ANOVA revealed significant (adjusted p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.025) participant-informant x time interactions for Working Memory, Metacognition Index and Global Executive Composite, suggesting that the changes in ratings over time differed between participants and informants. Post hoc tests revealed that at baseline participants rated themselves as significantly more impaired (adjusted p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.036) than informants on the Working Memory scale, the Metacognitive Index and the Global Executive Composite. After training, no significant differences were found between participant and informant reports. After training participants reported significant improvements on Working Memory (adjusted p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038), Metacognition Index (adjusted p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038), with working memory improving from above the established clinically significant impairment threshold to the normal range. The change in Global Executive Composite was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons (adjusted p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.057). No significant changes were found for relatives' reported scores between the two time points. Excluding participants developing dementia during the study enhanced the difference in mean values before and after the intervention for these outcomes. Computerized working memory training significantly improved self-reported executive function in individuals with MCI. While informant reports remained stable, the prior significant discrepancy between self- and informant ratings converged after training due to this improvement. These findings suggest that training can enhance subjective cognitive experience and awareness, offering potential clinical benefits for individuals with MCI.

Researchers conducted a structured questionnaire survey on 736 university students from three universities(Hunan University of Science and Technology, Anhui University of Finance &amp; Economics, and Hunan Normal University), measuring their self-reported responses on six constructs: academic anxiety, social anxiety, future anxiety, positive metacognition, negative metacognition, and smartphone addiction. The study interpreted the non-compensatory and non-linear relationships between predictors and smartphone addiction by applying the Structural Equation Modeling - Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) method. The findings revealed that academic anxiety had no significant impact on smartphone addiction, nor did social and future anxiety on positive metacognition and social anxiety on negative metacognition. Furthermore, positive metacognition did not play a mediating role between anxiety and smartphone addiction, nor did negative metacognition between social anxiety and smartphone addiction. The remaining hypotheses were validated. Additionally, according to the normalized importance derived from the multilayer perceptron, the study identified the most critical predictive factor as negative metacognition (100%), followed by future anxiety (49.19%), social anxiety (29.52%), positive metacognition (16.51%), and academic anxiety (10.73%).

    "abstract": "Self-explanation (SE), an individual learning strategy for the development of clinical reasoning skills, has been implemented in undergraduate medical curricula. A tool for documenting students' appropriate use of SE is needed to ensure benefit on learning. The objective of this project was to develop such a tool and report on evidence of its validity. We used DeVellis's eight steps to develop the tool. Assessors applied the tool to 85 audio-recorded SEs. We calculated students' mean number of inferences (biomedical, clinical, monitoring) and case elements used when self-explaining to document validity evidence of content. We used interrater agreement, with intraclass correlation coefficients, to document validity evidence of response processes. Three assessors documented the students' use of SE with the tool. They found means of 13.33 to 17.76 biomedical inferences, 16.27 to 27.04 clinical inferences, 2.03 to 3.10 monitoring statements, and listed 21.77 to 26.87 case elements. Interrater reliability varied from 0.53 to 0.96. We developed the tool using the principles underlying SE. The way students used SE aligned with our expectations. Assessors used the tool in a consistent way. The tool could document students' use of SE in experimental or educational contexts.

    "abstract": "People often use external tools to offload cognitive demands associated with remembering future intentions. While previous research has established a causal role of metacognition in cognitive offloading, the neural basis of white matter tracts supporting this metacognitive control process remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a study with 34 participants using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine how white matter connectivity supports metacognition driven cognitive offloading. Behaviorally, we replicated prior findings showing that under-confidence in internal memory predicts a bias toward using external reminders. At the neural level, we used diffusion tensor imaging to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of microstructural integrity in white matter. We found the microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum bundle (CB) predicted deviations from the optimal use of reminders. The microstructural integrity of the fornix negatively predicted participants' confidence in performing the task when restricted to internal memory. Our findings reveal the microstructural organization of the white-matter tracts in the fronto-temporal-parietal network are related to metacognition driven cognitive offloading. We discuss several aspects of metacognition driven cognitive offloading from a white matter microstructural perspective.",

    "abstract": "The primate brain excels at transforming photons into knowledge. When light strikes the back of the eye, opsin molecules within rods and cones absorb photons, triggering a change in membrane potential. This energy transfer initiates a cascade of neural events that endows us with useful knowledge. This knowledge manifests as subjectively experienced perceptual interpretations and mostly pertains to the 3D structure of the visual environment and the affordances of the objects within the scene. However, some of this knowledge instead pertains to the quality of these interpretations and contributes to our sense of confidence in perceptual decisions. Because such confidence reflects knowledge about knowledge, psychologists consider this the domain of metacognition. Here, we examine what is known about the neuronal basis of perceptual decision confidence, with a focus on vision. We review the crucial computational processes and neural operations that underlie and constrain the transformation of photons into visual metacognition.",

    "abstract": "Physicians sometimes encounter various types of gut feelings (GFs) during clinical diagnosis. The type of GF addressed in this paper refers to the intuitive sense that the generated hypothesis might be incorrect. An appropriate diagnosis cannot be obtained unless these GFs are articulated and inventive solutions are devised. Thus, the method of articulating GFs is critical. The current study proposes reflective verbalization (RV) to help healthcare professionals capitalize on their GF. In cognitive psychology, RV is the process of verbalizing one's thoughts and feelings through metacognition, to promote deeper understanding and insight problem-solving. When applied to clinical reasoning, RV can help doctors verbalize their GFs, refining their diagnostic hypotheses. To address GFs systematically using RV, we introduce the DATES approach, comprising five perspectives: Degree, Abandoned, Time course, Excess, and Shortage. Each perspective prompts physicians to compare their patient's information against typical illness scripts, ensuring no detail is omitted or overlooked. The tool also aids physicians in considering possible differential diagnoses for one or more of these elements. This guiding tool may aid physicians in overcoming biases, including confirmation and anchoring biases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy. This tool is useful for healthcare professionals who wish to improve their clinical reasoning and decision-making abilities, particularly when they encounter inexplicable contradictions in their diagnostic hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Generative activity can interfere with later retrieval of related concepts and words. This semantic interference has been ascribed to long-term adaptive learning mechanisms that promote access to selected representations and hinder access to coactivated competitors. Some accounts in the memory literature posit that the punishment doled out to coactivated competitors may actually serve as a catalyst for more robust relearning in comparison to never-punished controls. The present work investigates whether this claim also applies to lexical access by assessing how adaptive learning processes unfold during generation of taxonomically related words in each phase of a modified retrieval practice and relearning design. In each phase, there was cumulative semantic interference across category member ordinal position, demonstrating that interference accrues with each related retrieval. The final assessment phase showed persistent semantic interference in the absence of relearning, but naming was equivalent for activated and control conditions that were subjected to relearning. These results provide a detailed window into the temporal dynamics of learning and relearning in conceptual-lexical access but suggest that enhanced relearning chiefly applies to novel learning episodes and not well learned conceptual-lexical links.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents' metacognitive skills and social relationships play key roles in learning but are often studied in isolation. This study investigated the links between metacognition, learning performance, and classroom friendship networks in a sample of 136 seventh-grade students from Switzerland (53.8% female; mean age 13.8&#x2009;years) assessed at two time points 3&#x2009;months apart. Metacognition was measured on-task. Monitoring was assessed through confidence judgments, and control through decisions about what to restudy and which responses to submit or withdraw from grading. Participants learned the meanings of Japanese characters (\"Kanji\"), self-tested memorization, monitored their performance, made restudy decisions, and submitted selected responses. Social friendship networks were measured with friendship nominations within classrooms. Results showed that decision accuracy strongly predicted Kanji task scores at both time points. Monitoring-based restudy became a significant predictor of task scores at the second measurement, indicating that participants who strategically restudied items for which confidence was initially low achieved higher scores. No evidence was found for friends influencing adolescents' metacognitive skills. Friends did, however, become more similar in task performance over time, suggesting that peer influence may shape learning processes other than the investigated metacognitive processes. These findings highlight the importance of metacognitive control and friendship dynamics for adolescents' learning outcomes.",

However, few studies have elucidated the neural underpinnings of different metacognition subdimensions. Additionally, the relationship between these functional neural bases and longitudinal changes in individual emotional distresses remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 180 college students completed brain imaging and a battery of behavioral assessments. Employing the connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), we delineated the functional connectivity (FC) network of each metacognition subdimension. Then, the mediation model was used to explore the relationships between FC networks, metacognition subdimensions, and emotional distresses. <b>Results:</b> Default mode network (DMN) was found to be the general network of three significant subdimensions. Specifically, the FC network of cognitive self-consciousness (CSC) was scattered and mainly relied on DMN and frontoparietal network; need to control thoughts (NC) was largely consisted of the correlates between DMN and ventral attention network (VAN); negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry (NEG) was primarily associated with DMN and its correlates with visual network. CSC, NC, and NEG could mediate the relationship between the corresponding FC network and emotional distresses. Additionally, the CSC related and NEG related FCs could effectively predict the change of anxiety positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings demonstrated the common and distinct FC bases of maladaptive metacognition. The excessive FCs of CSC and NEG might be responsible for impaired self-check-related ability and further increase the risk of several affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are overrepresented among individuals with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We aimed to study the prevalence of ASD symptoms in extremely undernourished inpatients with AN and focus on potential cognitive and nutritional correlates. We recruited prospectively all extremely undernourished patients with AN admitted to the Nutritional Care Unit of Paul Brousse Hospital over four months. ASD traits and AN psychopathology were assessed by administering the Autism Quotient (AQ) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2). Neuropsychological and bio-nutritional data were also collected. Among 33 participants aged 25.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.3 (91&#xa0;% females, BMI: 12.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.4), 12&#xa0;% scored above the clinical cut-off on the AQ. Independently of age and BMI, EDI-2 scores were significantly correlated with AQ-total scores (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), higher levels of cognitive rigidity (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.61; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and sensory sensitivity alterations (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.69; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). In the cross-sectional model, the AQ-communication domain, and the GSQ-hyposensitivity scale were significant predictors (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.5) of the variance in EDI-2 scores. Negative beliefs and cognitive confidence were associated with lower levels of Transthyretin (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.02). ASD traits presented high prevalence in extremely undernourished patients with AN. Despite the impact that malnutrition can have on cognitive functioning, most of these traits appear to be independent of BMI but associated with the severity of eating psychopathology; only Transthyretin was associated with dysfunctional metacognitions. These preliminary results suggest that ASD symptoms might co-occur in severe AN and require specific therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a scale to assess adaptive sleep-related beliefs and behaviors, measuring how well individuals accept sleep disturbances, in the Korean general population. We conducted an anonymous online survey among the Korean general population. The scale development involved the following process: 1) defining the purpose of developing the scale, 2) generating appropriate items, 3) reducing redundant items, 4) conducting psychometric tests and further reducing items, and 5) developing the final version of the scale. Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the scale were evaluated, and convergent validity was examined using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-6 items (DBAS-6), and Metacognition Questionnaire-Insomnia-6 items (MCQI-6). The final six items extracted through exploratory factor analysis were clustered into two factors: adaptive sleep-related cognitions and behaviors. Model fit indices (comparative fit index&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.96, Tucker-Lewis index&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.93, root mean square error of approximation&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06, and standardized root mean square residual&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) supported the two-factor structure of the scale in confirmatory factor analysis. The Adaptive Cognition and Behaviors about Sleep-6 (ACBS-6) demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (McDonald's omega&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.734). Linear regression analysis revealed that the DBAS-6 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.50, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and MCQI-6 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.22, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) positively contributed to the ISI score, whereas ACBS-6 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.07, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.041) inversely contributed to the ISI score. The ACBS-6 exhibits acceptable reliability and strong structural validity, supporting its two-factor model of adaptive sleep-related cognitions and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of the MathByExample intervention, which integrates worked examples and self-explanation prompts into math worksheets to address 4th and 5th graders' misconceptions. Researchers conducted a year-long, classroom-based experiment in 58 U.S. classrooms, randomly assigning classrooms to experimental or control conditions. The study explored the intervention's impact on algebra readiness and the moderating effects of prior knowledge and intervention dosage. Results showed no significant overall impact of the intervention on foundational algebra knowledge (FAK) or preparation for future learning (PFL). However, further analysis provided key insights. For FAK scores, greater self-explanation prompt attempts improved learning, but only when students engaged with a high number of worksheets. Students with higher prior knowledge experienced a negative effect of attempting more worksheets, suggesting they may not benefit from excessive practice. Self-explanation attempts had a stronger positive effect for students with higher prior knowledge. For PFL scores, self-explanation attempts significantly improved PFL scores, but only for students with at least average prior knowledge, with the strongest effects seen in those completing more worksheets. These findings suggest that educators may benefit from actively incorporating the study and explanation of worked examples into elementary math instruction. To maximize their impact, teachers should regularly integrate worked examples into their lessons. Encouraging students to engage with worked examples through self-explanation may mitigate common misconceptions and enhance students' readiness for more advanced algebra concepts.",

    "abstract": "Testing enhances memory more than studying. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the robustness of this classic effect, its neural and computational origin remains debated. Predictive learning is a potential mechanism behind this phenomenon: Because predictions and prediction errors (mismatch between predictions and feedback) are more likely to be generated in testing (relative to in studying), testing can benefit more from predictive learning. We shed light on the testing effect from a multilevel analysis perspective via a combination of cognitive neuroscience experiments (fMRI) and computational modeling. Behaviorally and computationally, only a model incorporating predictive learning can account for the full breadth of behavioral patterns and the robust testing effect. At the neural level, testing and prediction error both activate the canonical reward-related brain areas in the ventral striatum, insula, and midbrain. Crucially, back sorting analysis revealed that activation in the ventral striatum, insula, and midbrain can enhance declarative memory. These results provide strong and converging evidence for a predictive learning account of the testing effect.",

By analyzing structural MRI data and metacognitive measures, it investigates how brain volume variations correlate with dysfunctional beliefs and OCD symptoms. The study consisted of 20 patients with OCD and 20 healthy controls. Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Scale (Y-BOCS), Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were administered to OCD patients and healthy controls. They then underwent structural MRI scans to measure the volume of the OFC and thalamus. On both sides, OCD patients had smaller volumes of OFC than healthy control individuals, and their thalamic volumes were similar to those of the control participants. Furthermore, MCQ-30 scores showed a substantial negative correlation with left OFC volume. In conclusion, we suggest that dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs might be related to the occurrence of OCD, and these beliefs might be associated with the left side of OFC neuroanatomically.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition that can impair both physical and cognitive impairments. The aim of this study, to compare physical activity (PA) levels, cognitive flexibility, metacognition and attention skills between individuals with MS and healthy individuals and to examine the relationship between PA and cognitive flexibility, metacognition and attention skills. The comparison of these abilities with healthy individuals enables the identification of MS-related functional deficits and supports the development of appropriate intervention programs. This cross-sectional study consisted of two groups. The study group included 35 individuals with relapsing remitting type MS who were diagnosed with MS by a neurologist. The control group included 33 healthy volunteers. Both groups were evaluated in terms of demographic information, PA level (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), cognitive flexibility (The Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI)), metacognition (The Metacognitions-30 Scale (MCS-30)) and attention (Stroop test-TBAG Form (STT) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) status of the participants. The differences between the two groups regarding these parameters were assessed, and their relationship with PA level in individuals with MS was examined. The two groups were similar in terms of age, gender and body mass index (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Compared to healthy controls, individuals with MS had lower IPAQ score and CFI scores (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and higher scores on MCS-30 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Individuals with MS had higher STT and TMT completion times than healthy individuals in all sections (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). There was a low statistically significant negative correlation between the IPAQ scores of individuals with MS and the completion times of the fourth and fifth parts of the Stroop Test (r=-0.364, -0.402; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). PA level, cognitive flexibility, metacognition and attention are negatively affected in individuals with MS. Therefore, in addition to routine assessments, it is important to perform detailed PA level and cognitive assessment in individuals with MS in order to plan rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Adversities suffered at an early age lead to negative long-term effects impacting the development of the emotional, social, and cognitive domains of the personality, including metacognitive skills. We aimed to investigate the mediating role of metacognition in the impact exercised by early adversities on trait anxiety. Participants (all over 18) were recruited from the general population (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;304). Adverse childhood experiences were assessed using the 10-item Adverse Childhood Questionnaire, for the assessment of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire was applied, while the level of the trait anxiety was investigated using the Trait Version of the State-Trait Anxiety inventory. To examine the mediating effect of metacognition between early adversities and trait anxiety mediation analysis was used. Adverse childhood experiences have a moderate effect on trait anxiety (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.348, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). More than half of the revealed associations were shown to be due to the maladaptive functioning of metacognition (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;56.03&#xa0;%). As regards specific maladaptive metacognitive beliefs, it was found that negative metacognitive beliefs (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;61.49&#xa0;%), the need to control thoughts (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;46.0&#xa0;%), and the lack of cognitive confidence (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;30.07&#xa0;%) play a crucial role in the mediating effect of metacognition. We can assume that the overall negative impact of early adversities on development is also manifested by the inadequacy of metacognition, which contributes to anxiety proneness. This inadequacy leads to the development of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs that prevent proper monitoring and correcting of the individual's internal contents, further increasing the level of trait-like anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval often enhances memory more than restudy (i.e., the testing effect), reflecting the encoding (or re-encoding) effects of retrieval. The present study assessed how similar these retrieval-based encoding processes are to more typical study-based encoding processes. Deep (semantic) processing at encoding benefits memory more than shallow (non-semantic) processing (i.e., levels of processing). If retrieval-based encoding operates similarly, an analogous levels of retrieval effect should occur, with semantic retrieval increasing the benefits of retrieval more than non-semantic retrieval. Participants studied short lists of words, each followed by restudy or retrieval trials, in preparation for a recognition test taken immediately (Experiment 1) or two days later (Experiments 1 and 2). Participants restudied words alongside phonemic or semantic cues, or retrieved words given those cues. In Experiment 2, participants completed two additional rounds of restudy or retrieval. To isolate the effects of processing level on retrieval, testing effects were calculated for each level by subtracting performance in each restudy condition from the corresponding retrieval condition. There was no evidence of a levels of retrieval effect - the benefit from phonemic retrieval over phonemic restudy was either similar (Experiment 1) or greater (Experiment 2) than the benefit from semantic retrieval over semantic restudy.",

    "abstract": "To explore what factors are considered in making an entrustment decision about a provisionally registered (intern) pharmacist from the perspectives of registered and intern pharmacists. Registered and intern pharmacists in Australia were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. The survey included open-ended, free-text questions exploring the factors influencing entrustment decisions for three Entrustable Professional Activities developed by the Australian Pharmacy Council for use in workplace-based assessments of intern pharmacists: dispensing medicines, compounding pharmaceutical products, and providing medication counselling. Qualitative data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis approach to identify key themes and subthemes influencing entrustment decisions. Of the 302 respondents (220 registered pharmacists and 82 interns), 215 participants provided qualitative responses. Analysis revealed four major themes: (1) Intern's competency and skill proficiency, with emphasis on technical knowledge, task execution, and interpersonal skills; (2) Intern's self-awareness and metacognition, including receptiveness to feedback and reflective practice; (3) Entrustment process dynamics, highlighting task complexity, contextual risk, and supervisor trust propensity; and (4) Barriers to and opportunities for establishing entrustment practices that guide entrustment decisions. Supervisors reported relying on team-based perspectives to inform entrustment decisions. Entrustment decision-making is a multifaceted process shaped by intern characteristics, task complexity, and contextual dynamics. In addition to technical competence, metacognitive capabilities and reflective practice were identified as critical to fostering more autonomy in practice. Variability in supervisors' trust propensity and entrustment practices highlights the need to strengthen entrustment practices to enhance consistency in how decisions are made and to support effective use of Entrustable Professional Activities in workplace-based pharmacy education.",

    "abstract": "We examined the association between metacognitive performance, functioning, and quality of life (QoL) in schizophrenia using structural equation model analyses. A sample of 249 participants was assessed for symptoms, functioning, QoL, and both objective and subjective cognitive performance. Metacognitive performance was defined as the adequation between objective and subjective measures of cognitive performance. Our model showed an excellent fit (CFI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.981; RMSEA&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014-0.081) and explained 53.3&#xa0;% of the variance in functioning and 50.3&#xa0;% in QoL. Metacognitive performance was not significantly associated with functioning but showed a negative association with QoL (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.383, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Thus, a greater underestimation of one's cognitive abilities was linked with lower QoL, potentially reflecting heightened awareness of deficits that affect well-being. Depression, also negatively associated with QoL (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.359, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), was linked to the underestimation of cognitive abilities, whereas symptom severity was associated with their overestimation (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.296, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Complementary analyses suggest that the subjective cognition model closely mirrors that of metacognitive performance, questioning the distinctiveness of metacognition as an explanatory factor in schizophrenia outcomes. Our findings imply that interventions that boost confidence in cognitive abilities, such as cognitive remediation, may improve QoL. Future research should investigate the causal pathways between these factors and explore the role of social cognition, often impaired in schizophrenia, as another mediator. Comprehensive treatment that addresses clinical symptoms, depression, and subjective cognition challenges appear essential to improve outcomes in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWhen making memory predictions (judgments of learning; JOLs), people typically underestimate the recall gain across multiple study–test cycles, termed the underconfidence-with-practice (UWP) effect. This is usually studied with verbal materials, but little is known about how people repeatedly learn and monitor their own actions and to what extent retrieval practice via interim tests influence the progression of JOLs across cycles. Using action phrases (i.e.,squeeze the lemon) as learning material, we demonstrated the UWP effect after both verbal and enactive encoding, although we did not get first-cycle overconfidence. As predicted, participants exhibited underconfidence in Cycles 2 and 3, as an error of calibrations. However, people’s resolution of JOLs (i.e., ability to discriminate recalled from unrecalled items) increased across study–test cycles. Importantly, JOLs for study–test (relative to study–study) items increased faster across cycles suggesting that repeated study–test practice not only produces underconfidence across cycles, but also reduces underconfidence relative to study–study practice. We discuss these findings in terms of current explanations of the underconfidence-with-practice effect.",

    "abstract": "Given the potential role of self-regulated learning (SRL) for enhancing practice and expertise development, we aimed to advance a valid and reliable athlete self-report measure of SRL for sport practice. We built on Toering et al. (2012a) initial SRL instrument along with Bartulovic et al. (2017) sport-specific modifications, and created new items to extend the conceptual breadth of the subscales. With a multi-sport sample of 482 athletes (Mage = 26.45, SD = 12.66; 55% female), two analytic phases tested (1) the factorial validity of the initial and the extended inventories, and (2) criterion validity, by examining how SRL scores distinguished skill groups ranging from local to international competitive levels. In Phase 1, the initial measurement model demonstrated psychometric concerns and we opted to pursue a refined model. The extended model demonstrated acceptable factorial validity but resulted in the fewest subscales. In Phase 2, subscales scores from all three models generally distinguished international-level senior (18 + years) athletes from lesser-skilled groups. Integrating the psychometric evidence and between-group effects across the initial, refined, and extended models, we conclude that the refined inventory, the Self-Regulated Learning for Sport Practice (SRL-SP) survey, is the preferred instrument.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have profoundly influenced both professional environments and personal lives. In the rapidly developing sector of AI education, fostering essential AI literacy among university students has become vital. Nevertheless, the factors that determine AI literacy remain insufficiently defined. This research, grounded in self-determination theory (SDT), seeks to investigate the relationships among three components: the fulfillment of university students' three psychological needs, self-regulated learning strategies (SRLSs), and AI literacy. The aim is to enhance human capital efficiency and prepare students to tackle future workplace challenges effectively. To examine these connections, a cross-sectional survey was administered to 1056 university students. The findings reveal that satisfying the three psychological needs-perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness-plays a pivotal role in advancing AI literacy among university students. Additionally, four SRLSs-cognitive engagement, metacognitive knowledge, resource management, and motivational beliefs-acted as mediators between these psychological needs and AI literacy. Consequently, this study not only enhances our understanding of the psychological and behavioral development of university students during their engagement with AI education but also provides theoretical support and practical guidance for fostering their AI literacy.",

    "abstract": "Research into metacognitive listening instruction under the Metacognitive Pedagogical Cycle (MPC) has been growing in recent decades, but its effects on L2 listening comprehension, metacognitive awareness, and self-efficacy remain inconclusive. In this mixed-method study, we developed a self-directed online listening practice based on the MPC and investigated its effects on 89 Chinese intermediate EFL learners over 14 weeks. Learners were assigned to either an experimental group, which used the online metacognitive listening practice, or a control group, which used the traditional listening practice without stressing metacognitive awareness. Multiple data sources (listening tests, questionnaires, reflective notes, and interviews) were used to assess learners' listening comprehension, metacognitive awareness, and listening self-efficacy. Results showed that online metacognitive listening practice significantly improved the learners' listening comprehension, but there was little evidence that it increased metacognitive awareness or listening self-efficacy. This study suggests that deploying online listening practice under MPC is a more effective way to improve L2 learners' listening comprehension than traditional listening practice. However, the task-setting of MPC and the task-dependence of self-efficacy may constrain the development of some factors of metacognitive awareness and self-efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Memory retrieval affects subsequent memory in both positive (e.g., the testing effect) and negative (e.g., retrieval-induced forgetting [RIF]) ways, and can be contrasted with other forms of memory modification (e.g., study-based encoding). Divided attention substantially impairs study-based encoding but has a modest effect on retrieval. What of the subsequent learning consequences of retrieval? Earlier studies indicate that certain positive effects (i.e., the testing effect) are not reduced by distraction, whereas negative effects (i.e., RIF) are eliminated. The present study assessed an indirect (positive) effect of retrieval-the forward testing effect (FTE), in which prior retrieval or retrieval attempts enhance subsequent learning. Two experiments examined the role of attention in both the standard FTE and the pretesting effect. In Experiment 1, participants learned three study lists through retrieval practice or restudy, followed by a fourth study list. Prior retrieval practice enhanced subsequent new learning more than restudy (i.e., the standard FTE), and to a similar degree under full attention (FA) and divided attention (DA). In Experiment 2, participants learned cue-target word pairs by either studying the pair or guessing the target when shown a cue (i.e., pretesting) followed by the correct pair. Pretesting enhanced memory more than just studying to a similar degree under FA and DA. In sum, both forms of the FTE were unaffected by distraction, indicating that these positive consequences of retrieval are not based on controlled processes but instead appear to be relatively obligatory consequences of retrieval (or retrieval attempts). These results also have relevance for specific accounts of the standard FTE and the pretesting effect.",

    "abstract": "The testing effect-more learning by testing as compared to restudying-is a well-established finding. A typical testing procedure in the context of meaningful learning comprises a recall task after an initial study phase. Different theories refer to different mechanisms when explaining the positive effects of such recall tasks. In the context of learning from expository texts, we tested three mechanisms as suggested by a variety of prominent approaches: the elaborative-retrieval theory, the theory of transfer-appropriate processing, and the unspecific-goal perspective. We experimentally varied the type of testing task (short-answer task vs. free-recall task, both compared to a restudy task) in a within-subject design (N = 47 university students). We replicated the testing effect. We found no evidence for a transfer-appropriate processing effect or an unspecific-goal effect. The testing effect disappeared when statistically controlling for mental effort. Initially non-tested material was also fostered by testing (spreading activation effect). These findings indicate that testing helps learning when learners must invest substantial mental effort, as suggested by the elaborative retrieval theory. For educational purposes, testing tasks should be assigned that require the learners to invest substantial mental effort.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe investigated spaced retrieval and restudying in 3 preregistered, online experiments. In all experiments, participants studied 40 Swahili–English word pair translations during an initial study phase, restudied intact pairs or attempted to retrieve the English words to Swahili cues twice in three spaced practice sessions, and then completed a final cued-recall test. All 5 sessions were separated by 2 days. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the response format during retrieval (covert vs. overt) and the test list structure (blocked vs. intermixed covert/overt retrieval trials). A memory rating was required on all trials (retrieval: “Was your answer correct?”; restudy: “Would you have remembered the correct translation?”). Response format had no effect on recall, but surprisingly, final test performance for restudied items exceeded both the overt and covert retrieval conditions. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the requirement to make a memory rating. If a memory rating was required, final test restudy performance exceeded retrieval performance, replicating Experiment 1. However, the pattern was descriptively reversed if no rating was required. In Experiment 3, the memory rating was removed altogether, and we examined recall performance for items restudied versus retrieved once, twice, or thrice. Performance improved with practice, and retrieval performance exceeded restudy performance in all conditions. The reversal of the typical retrieval practice effect observed in Experiments 1 and 2 is discussed in terms of theories of reactivity of memory judgments.",

Introductory Psychology students at nine colleges/universities took quizzes with more (RP+) or less (RP−) retrieval practice and more (SP+) or less (SP−) spacing between quizzes. We compared (N = 351) scores on class exams and on a standardized test. We also measured key student variables (e.g., depth of processing). GPA predicted a significant portion of variance in exam scores, R2 = 0.05, F(1, 204) = 10.84, p = 0.001. We found a main effect for retrieval practice and a significant retrieval by spacing practice interaction, R2 = 0.28, F(3, 201) = 27.38, p &lt; 0.001. Students using SP+, as well as those with SP− and RP−, scored higher than students using SP− and RP+. In practice, closer attention needs to be paid to quiz and exam content overlap and the duration within which repetition is used.",

    "abstract": "Building domain knowledge is essential to a student's success in any course. Chemistry, similar to other STEM disciplines, has a strong cumulative element (i.e., topic areas continuously build upon prior coursework). We employed the testing effect, in the form of post-exam retrieval quizzes, as a way to improve students’ understanding of chemistry over an entire semester. Students (n = 146) enrolled in Introduction to Chemistry were presented with retrieval quizzes released one week after each during-term exam (that covered that exam's content). We measured students’ level of quiz participation, during-term exam scores (a control variable), and cumulative final exam scores to determine the effectiveness of implementing a post-exam retrieval quiz system. Most critically, students completing more than 50% of the retrieval quizzes performed significantly better (i.e., more than a half letter grade) on the cumulative final exam than those who were below 50% participation as determined by one-way between-subjects ANOVA and planned follow-up analyses. We found no significant differences between the participating groups on during-term exam scores, suggesting that high achieving students were not more likely than struggling students to participate in the practice testing (and thus benefit from it).",

    "abstract": "Structural variants such as chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplications can play an important role in the adaptation and diversification of organisms. Here, we used comparative genomics to study the functional implications of structural variants across two families of flies. We compared the reference genomes of eight Asilidae species and six Stratiomyidae species, including the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens), a species with an ability to convert organic waste into biomass and a recently expanded global range. Our results show that the genomes of Stratiomyidae are generally larger than Asilidae and contain a higher proportion of transposable elements, many of which are recently expanded. Gene families showing more gene duplications are enriched for life history related functions such as metabolism in Stratiomyidae which are known to be active decomposers, and longevity in Asilidae which are predators and have generally longer lifespan than Stratiomyidae. Gene families showing more gene duplications that are specific to H. illucens are mostly related to olfactory and immune responses, while across the Stratiomyidae there is enrichment of digestive and metabolic functions such as proteolysis, providing an explanation for the higher decomposing efficiency and adaptive ability of H. illucens compared to other Stratiomyidae species in decomposing environments. Together, our results shed light on the contribution of structural variants to functional adaptation and gene family expansions that have likely played a role in the ecological success of the black soldier fly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTwo studies investigated the testing effects on performance and on metacognitive judgment accuracy in authentic learning settings. Across two educational psychology courses, undergraduate students had the opportunity to voluntarily participate in four different practice tests during the term—without feedback in Study 1 (N = 201 students) or with individual corrective feedback in Study 2 (N = 111 students). Across studies in real classroom settings with and without feedback, regression analyses indicated that a higher number of taken practice tests were related to higher performance in the final course exam and to two scores of metacognitive judgment accuracy (absolute accuracy and sensitivity). However, students’ preparation and post-processing practice tests, their perceived usefulness of tests for monitoring one’s performance, and metacognitive specificity differed depending on whether students received feedback or not. Overall, the studies convey considerable evidence on how participation in practice tests is related not only to performance but also to monitoring accuracy in authentic learning settings.",

Students were tested on their knowledge of a self‐assessment grading rubric (on a 30‐item multiple‐choice exam) and their ability to apply the rubric (on a simulated dentoform assessment).ResultsThere were significant main effects of both ENG and SRP on both outcome measures. Both ENG and SRP increased students’ knowledge of, and ability to apply, the self‐assessment rubric. Effects of ENG were larger than those of SRP. There was also a significant ENG X SRP interaction on the knowledge measure. The effect of SRP was larger in the no‐ENG conditions than the ENG conditions, which may reflect a ceiling effect in the ENG conditions.ConclusionsENG and SRP have the potential to substantially enhance D1 dental students’ learning outcomes. These results should motivate dental educators to reject outdated instructional techniques and thereby unleash students’ full learning potential. Additional research is needed with a wider range of dental students and learner topics.",

In another condition, judges read about a yoked learners' retrieval practice performance but did not participate in retrieval practice and therefore, could not use non-analytic processes for the second prediction. In Study 1, learners reduced their predictions following moderately difficult retrieval practice whereas judges increased their predictions.

Results of immediate tests showed that more ideas were recalled by the repeated study (SSSS) group than by the repeated test (STTT) group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Results of delayed tests showed that the STTT group or even the single test (SSST) group was more successful with long-term retention than the SSSS group.

    "abstract": "If the mnemonic benefits of testing are to be widely realized in real-world learning circumstances, people must appreciate the value of testing and choose to utilize testing during self-guided learning. Yet metacognitive judgments do not appear to reflect the enhancement provided by testing Karpicke & Roediger (Science 319:966-968, 2008). In this article, we show that under judicious conditions, learners can indeed reveal an understanding of the beneficial effects of testing, as well as the interaction of that effect with delay (experiment 1). In that experiment, subjects made judgments of learning (JOLs) for previously studied or previously tested items in either a cue-only or a cue-target context, and either immediately or after a 1-day delay. When subjects made judgments in a cue-only context, their JOLs accurately reflected the effects of testing, both immediately and at a delay. To evaluate the potential of exposure to such conditions for promoting generalized appreciation of testing effects, three further experiments elicited global predictions about restudied and tested items across two study/test cycles (experiments 2, 3, and 4). The results indicated that learners' global na&#xef;ve metacognitive beliefs increasingly reflect the beneficial effects of testing when learners experience these benefits with increasing external support. If queried under facilitative circumstances, learners appreciate the mnemonic enhancement that testing provides on both an item-by-item and global basis but generalize that knowledge to future learning only with considerable guidance.",

    "abstract": "Several previous studies appear to have demonstrated that studying with retrieval practice produces more learning than studying with concept mapping, a finding based on which an extended use of retrieval practice in educational practice was recommended. However, a closer examination of the methods used in these previous studies reveals a crucial confounding variable: Whereas participants in the concept mapping conditions performed a concept mapping task without any subsequent memorizing of the learning material, participants in the retrieval practice conditions performed not only retrieval practice but also an additional memorization task, which doubled the total memorization time. The present preregistered study examined whether the advantage observed in the retrieval practice condition over the concept mapping condition in previous studies was actually driven by additional memorization rather than by retrieval practice. While we replicated the previous finding that retrieval practice in combination with additional memorizing produces more learning than concept mapping without additional memorizing, this advantage of retrieval practice over concept mapping vanished when participants in the concept mapping condition, too, memorized the learning material after having created a concept map. These findings demonstrate that the assumed advantage of retrieval practice over concept mapping in fact represents a methodological artifact. Besides serving as a reminder of the importance of a solid methodology, the present study also illustrates the importance of using of an adequate terminology. Depicting a learning strategy condition as “retrieval practice” when the condition actually encompasses not only retrieval practice but also additional memorizing obfuscates the possibility that observed memory advantages may not be fueled by retrieval practice, i.e., the learning strategy as such. We conclude by giving an outlook on the ramifications of our findings for cognitive and educational psychology.",

    "abstract": "There is substantial interest in the extent to which the testing effect (the finding that retrieval practice enhances memory) extends to more complex forms of learning, especially those entailing greater element interactivity. Transitive inference (TI) requires just such interactivity, in which information must be combined across multiple learning elements or premises to extract an underlying structure. Picklesimer et al. provided preliminary evidence that retrieval practice fails to enhance, and actually disrupts, TI. This study assessed the generality of that result. The current experiments employed a seven- or eight-element TI paradigm in which participants initially learned a set of premise pairs (e.g., A &gt; B, B &gt; C, and C &gt; D) and then engaged in either restudy or retrieval practice of the premise pairs before taking a final test that assessed memory for the original premise pairs and one’s ability to make TIs (e.g., to infer that B &gt; D). Experiments 1 and 2 used pictorial materials and simultaneous presentation of premises during learning, a form of presentation that has induced testing effects on other forms of inference. For TI, the results were unchanged from Picklesimer et al.—TI was worse for retrieval practice than restudy. Experiment 3 used verbal materials and likewise found worse TI for retrieval practice. A small-scale meta-analysis combining the current experiments with those of Picklesimer et al. revealed a significant negative testing effect on TI ( d = −0.37). Although retrieval practice enhances many aspects of memory, this fundamental aspect of human reasoning may be impaired by retrieval practice.",

    "abstract": "Although general growth mindset interventions have been found to improve learning outcomes, relatively little research focused on effects of specific growth mindset interventions. However, domain-specific growth mindset beliefs may be a more accurate predictor of performance within that same domain. The current study investigated the effect of a specific growth mindset intervention designed to enhance self-regulated learning on learners’ adoption of retrieval practice while studying image–name pairs. The impact of this targeted approach was compared to the effects of a broader, general growth mindset intervention, which emphasized the brain’s malleability. Participants were 178 first-year university students, who were randomly assigned to three groups: a general growth mindset group (n = 58), a specific growth mindset group (n = 64), and a control group (n = 56). All groups were informed about the benefits of retrieval practice after the intervention. Our results showed that higher education students can benefit from mindset interventions in terms of their growth mindset beliefs. However, no effects on the use of retrieval practice were found, possibly due to the high difficulty of the learning material. Future research could explore the difficulty of learning materials when investigating the effect of mindset interventions on students’ use retrieval practice during self-regulated learning.",

    "abstract": "Purpose\n            Researchers in the cognitive sciences have identified several key training strategies that support good encoding and retention of target information. These strategies are retrieval-based practice, also known as learning through testing, and spaced practice. The recent resurgence of research on retrieval-based and spaced practice has been extended to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies to support learning in individuals with language disorders. The purpose of the current article is to review key principles of retrieval-based and spaced practice that can be used to support word learning in individuals within clinical and educational contexts.\n          \n          \n            Conclusion\n            Current research provides evidence that principles of retrieval-based and spaced practice can enhance word learning for individuals with language disorders. Current research provides guidance for clinicians on how to implement these strategies both within and across sessions to support encoding and retention of target information. Additional research should be conducted to provide a better understanding of how to optimize encoding and retention in clinical and educational contexts. Most notably, research that examines long-term retention after interventions are withdrawn would further our understanding of how these principles can be optimally applied to improve outcomes for individuals with language disorders.",

We conducted a field experiment to assess the effectiveness of a postinstruction intervention using a smartphone app that incorporated cognitive science principles aimed at improving learning. College students who completed a required credit review workshop during their sophomore year used the smartphone app in one of three practice conditions: control (no practice), massed, or spaced retrieval practice with elaborative feedback. On a final assessment about 5 months later, students who engaged in spaced retrieval practice were superior to those in the control and massed practice conditions in terms of knowledge.

    "abstract": "AbstractAfter being taught how to perform a new mathematical operation, students are often given several practice problems in a single set, such as a homework assignment or quiz (i.e., massed practice). An alternative approach is to distribute problems across multiple homeworks or quizzes, increasing the temporal interval between practice (i.e., spaced practice). Spaced practice has been shown to increase the long-term retention of various types of mathematics knowledge. Less clear is whether spacingdecreasesperformance during practice, with some studies indicating that it does and others indicating it does not. To increase clarity, we tested whether spacing produces long-term retention gains, but short-term practice costs, in a calculus course. On practice quizzes, students worked problems on various learning objectives in either massed fashion (3 problems on a single quiz) or spaced fashion (3 problems across 3 quizzes). Spacing increased retention of learning objectives on an end-of-semester test but reduced performance on the practice quizzes. The reduction in practice performance was nuanced: Spacing reduced performance only on the first two quiz questions, leaving performance on the third question unaffected. We interpret these findings as evidence that spacing led to more protracted, but ultimately more robust, learning. We, therefore, conclude that spacing imposes a desirable form of difficulty in calculus learning.",

In the present study, we examined the potential of retrieval practise during learning to improve the accuracy of confidence judgments in future retrieval. In a learning-from-text experiment with 98 secondary school students, we implemented an initial test as retrieval practise and a final test one week later. Both tests assessed students' correctness of answering and confidence in their answers. The final test comprised items already tested in the initial test (testing condition) and items not tested in the initial test (control condition). In the final test, the proportion of correct answers and the proportion of confident answers were higher in the testing condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, the confidence judgments were more accurate and less biased in the testing condition compared to the control condition. The results are discussed in the context of the functional relations between retrieval practise and metacognitive monitoring.",

The study was guided by two research questions while two null hypotheses were formulated and tested at 0.05 level of significance. The research design was true-experimental design with randomized pre-test, post-test. A sample of 80 students were selected and used for the study. Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale (MSAS) was used for data collection. The instrument yielded a reliability coefficient of 0.84. There were four groups in the study (three experimental groups and one control group) the experimental groups were taught reading using the computers while the control was taught using the conventional method. Descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation were used to answer the research questions while inferential statistics of t-test was used to test the hypotheses at .05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed a significant difference in the mean metacognition of students taught reading comprehension using blended and spaced learning and conventional learning strategies (t = 7.391 at df = 38; p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). The study concludes that blended and spaced learning strategies are effective teaching tool when integrated into classrooms for teaching of reading. Based on the findings, it was recommended among others that teachers of English language should consider adopting the use of blended and spaced learning strategies in other to improve students’ metacognition in reading comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval practice can enhance learning but is rarely used in self-regulated learning. Although explicit retrieval practice guidance (RPG)—which helps students use retrieval correctly—can improve learning outcomes, however, task difficulty and differences in academic self-efficacy (ASE) may influence retrieval practice decisions and learning performance, which were not considered in previous researches. The purpose of this study was to explore whether RPG produces different effects due to task difficulty and ASE. In Experiment 1, participants studied tasks with varying difficulty levels, some of which were guided. Results showed that RPG could enhance learning through increased retrieval practice, and participants engaged in more retrieval for difficult tasks. In Experiment 2, participants with different degrees of ASE learned tasks under guidance. Participants with high ASE persisted better on different tasks. Hence, task difficulty can affect retrieval practice decisions, and ASE increases persistence in retrieval practice. The implications of the findings for students’ use of RPG are discussed in this article.",

    "abstract": "Chapter 14, titled \"Spaced Practice in Classrooms\", also known as distributed practice, is an effective learning strategy that involves spreading out study sessions over time rather than cramming information in a single sitting. Psychological research has shown that students who engage in spaced practice tend to remember and retain information for the long term more effectively than those who cram. The chapter outlines the strategy and implementation of spaced practice in the classroom. Some of the key benefits associated with spaced practice include strong retrieval strength, reduced forgetfulness, enhanced learning efficiency, and improved long-term retention. The chapter also discusses some challenges associated with spaced practice, such as the potential for procrastination, lack of immediate gratification, and time constraints. Spaced learning tools are increasingly accessible to learners worldwide, featuring multilingual support and culturally relevant content.",

    "abstract": "Background: Metacognition is the process of awareness of the way in which we think. Healthcare practitioners are intrinsically required to make complex and demanding decisions daily—and just as with non-healthcare-related industries, they are susceptible to human error. Human factors (HF) can have catastrophic implications and the use of metacognition is a well-regarded tool to aid decision-making. Objective: This systematic review aimed to determine how metacognition and human factors influence decision-making in healthcare practitioners. Methods: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED) Database, Dentistry &amp; Oral Sciences Source, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, APA PsycArticles Psychology &amp; Behavioral Sciences Collection and APA PsychInfo were searched for eligible qualitative studies. The search was carried out in December 2021. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria for the current review. Twenty main themes and twenty-eight subthemes were categorised into twenty-one descriptive themes. These were synthesised into fourteen analytical themes, four of which were determined to be recurrent and one of which held significant implications for clinical practice: (1) Cognitive bias identification; (2) Systematic approach; (3) Holistic approach and creative thinking; (4) Identifying uncertainty; and (5) Drawbacks. Conclusions: This review found that metacognition improves decision-making in healthcare practitioners through cognitive bias identification, facilitation of systematic approaches, holistic approaches, and creative thinking. However, consideration should be made to its limitations. Further research is required to fully understand the findings in relation to specific practice areas and their clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n                Introduction\n                Knowledge, once acquired, degrades over time. Exams that contain questions related to previously acquired knowledge (‘retrieval practice questions’) may promote retrieval practice and spaced learning, and subsequently prevent knowledge loss. To investigate this hypothesis, we compare the score of retrieval practice questions to regular questions in exams of a two-year (bio)medical study program.\n              \n                Methods\n                The two-year “Mechanisms of Health and Disease”-program for biomedical sciences and medical students in Nijmegen (the Netherlands) contains 14 spaced exams of 80 questions each. The percentages of correct-, false-, and non-answers were compared between regular questions and retrieval practice questions. Using Pearson correlations between question scores and exam scores (RiT-values), the impact of retrieval practice questions on the internal consistency of exams was determined. Mixed model analyses determined changes in outcomes across time.\n              \n                Results\n                Analysis of 2006 regular questions and 1728 retrieval practice questions revealed a significantly higher percentage of correct and false answers, and a significantly lower percentage of non-answers, in retrieval practice questions versus regular questions (all P &lt; 0.05). Scores did not change across time. RiT-values were slightly lower in retrieval practice questions, with a small inverse trend across time.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our data indicate preservation of knowledge, possibly related to retrieval practice and/or spaced learning. Although the RiT-values of retrieval practice questions were slightly lower than those of regular questions, the discriminative capacity was well within acceptable range. These data highlight the potency of retrieval practice questions to prevent knowledge decrement, without altering exam quality.",

    "abstract": "Interference susceptibility has been suggested to be a major factor for episodic memory impairment in healthy older adults. Previous work has shown that retrieval practice can reduce proactive interference and thus enhance learning and memory in younger adults, a finding referred to as the forward effect of testing in the literature. This study examined the late developmental trajectory of the forward effect in middle-aged and older adults (40 to 79 years of age). Participants studied three lists of items in anticipation of a final cumulative recall test. In the testing condition, participants were tested immediately on Lists 1 and 2 after initial study, whereas in the restudy condition, they restudied Lists 1 and 2. In both conditions, participants were tested immediately on List 3. The results of the immediate List-3 recall test showed a reliable forward effect of testing, with interim testing of Lists 1 and 2 enhancing List-3 recall and reducing the number of prior-list intrusions. Notably, this effect of testing was found independent of participants' age. These results suggest that retrieval practice can reduce proactive interference in middle-aged and older adults. Together with recent findings on the presence of the backward effect of testing in older adults-that is, improved recall of studied material after retrieval versus restudy, these findings indicate that retrieval practice can be a very powerful tool to delimit memory impairment in older age.

    "abstract": "This review of the entrepreneurial metacognition literature systematizes the existing literature. Metacognition is vital for entrepreneurs to sense, act, and mobilize cognitive resources under uncertainty. Despite the rapidly growing stream of metacognitive research in entrepreneurship, indicating that the topic is promising and emerging, these bits of knowledge still need to be brought together to provide a big picture of where we have been to explore where we can go. Our review addresses this need by analyzing the literature on entrepreneurial metacognition. We define entrepreneurial metacognition as the mental activities of generating self-awareness and monitoring and controlling one’s cognition about identifying potential opportunities, creating a new venture, and/or managing a new venture. The inductive results reveal five attributes that reflect the essence of entrepreneurial metacognition: (a) adaptive cognition, (b) metaheuristics, (c) self-regulated cognition, (d) cultural adaptation, and (e) metacompetencies. We address definitional issues and empirical patterns, synthesize the attributes of entrepreneurial metacognition, and present a model that links entrepreneurial metacognition’s antecedents and outcomes to advance future research.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: At the beginning of the 21st century, older adults have become another group with special educational needs, not only because of their social and neuropsychological conditions, but also because of the growing number of people aged 60+. One of the fields that responds to those needs is foreign language geragogy.  Research Aim: The aim of the paper is to draw attention to retrieval practice (RP) strategy as an applicable method in teaching languages to older adults for maintaining their cognitive skills and to suggest some concrete solutions of the RP implementation in the language education.  Method: This study is of a theoretical-conceptual nature. The literature review was conducted in the fields of neurological and psychological characteristics of third-agers, as well as with reference to RP experiences in teaching children and teenagers. Own two-stages research focused on lecturers’ perspective explored through online surveys and a group interview.  Results: The RP strategy is an educational need reported by late L2 learners and their teachers. Due to its proven neurocognitive support of people aged 60+, the strategy is a valuable method of working with older adults. Results have allowed for proposing an applicable aspect. A few RP language practice models were offered as a tool facilitating learning, which is a novelty as for many years it was behind the interests of researchers and practitioners working with thirdagers.  Conclusion: The RP strategy is a technique worthy of attention because of the goals accompanying language learning in older age, such as cognitive development, supporting memory processes and maintaining social contacts. The use of RP strategies in language exercises allows to diversify the process of language education in a way that is adequate to the late L2 learners’ potential. All of these factors are undoubtedly crucial in the context of seniors’ well-being. This allows us to conclude that the benefits of language learning can have a holistic dimension for older adults, as long as the learning is carried out using appropriate methods.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of retrieval practice for aiding long-term memory, referred to as the testing effect, has been widely demonstrated. However, the specific neurocognitive mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. In the present study, we sought to explore the role of pre-retrieval processes at initial testing on later recognition performance by using event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects studied two lists of words (Chinese characters) and then performed a recognition task or a source memory task, or restudied the word lists. At the end of the experiment, subjects received a final recognition test based on the remember-know paradigm. Behaviorally, initial testing (active retrieval) enhanced memory retention relative to restudying (passive retrieval). The retrieval mode at initial testing was indexed by more positive-going ERPs for unstudied items in the active-retrieval tasks than in passive retrieval from 300 to 900 ms. Follow-up analyses showed that the magnitude of the early ERP retrieval mode effect (300-500 ms) was predictive of the behavioral testing effect later on. In addition, the ERPs for correctly rejected new items during initial testing differed between the two active-retrieval tasks from 500 to 900 ms, and this ERP retrieval orientation effect predicted differential behavioral testing gains between the two active-retrieval conditions. Our findings confirm that initial testing promotes later retrieval relative to restudying, and they further suggest that adopting pre-retrieval processing in the forms of retrieval mode and retrieval orientation might contribute to these memory enhancements.",
