    "abstract": "The author examined 2 distinctive aspects of emotion regulation in mathematics homework, including emotion management and cognitive reappraisal. Participants were 1,799 high school students from 46 classes in China. Two multilevel models were run, 1 with emotion management and another with cognitive reappraisal as the dependent variable. Both emotion management and cognitive reappraisal were positively associated with 5 individual-level variables (monitoring motivation, managing time, learning-oriented reasons, self-concept, and teacher feedback) and 1 class-level variable (self-concept). In addition, at the individual level, emotion management was associated negatively with adult-oriented reasons but positively with arranging the environment and prior mathematics achievement. Meanwhile, cognitive reappraisal was positively associated with parent education at the class level.",

    "abstract": "For students to thrive in the U.S. educational system, they must successfully cope with omnipresent demands of exams. Nearly all students experience testing situations as stressful, and signs of stress (e.g., racing heart) are typically perceived negatively. This research tested the efficacy of a psychosituational intervention targeting cognitive appraisals of stress to improve classroom exam performance. Ninety-three students (across five semesters) enrolled in a community college developmental mathematics course were randomly assigned to stress reappraisal or placebo control conditions. Reappraisal instructions educated students about the adaptive benefits of stress arousal, whereas placebo materials instructed students to ignore stress. Reappraisal students reported less math evaluation anxiety and exhibited improved math exam performance relative to controls. Mediation analysis indicated reappraisal improved performance by increasing students' perceptions of their ability to cope with the stressful testing situation (resource appraisals). Implications for theory development and policy are discussed. [At time of submission to ERIC this article was in press with &quot;Social Psychological and Personality Science.&quot;]",

    "abstract": "Most Americans will experience a form of trauma before adulthood, resulting in hindered learning and emotional regulation. The purpose of this quantitative, correlational-predictive study was to examine if and to what extent the two facets of Emotional Regulation, Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression, considered collectively, and individually within standard regression model, significantly predict the Well-being of online undergraduate learners in the United States. Emotion regulation theory and PERMA theory of well-being supported this research. The research questions predicted a correlation exists between the emotion regulation ability and well-being in online undergraduate learners. The sample of 84 online undergraduate learners completed two questionnaires, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the PERMA Profiler. The findings of a standard multiple linear regression indicated that the two facets of Emotional Regulation, Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression considered together significantly predict the Well-being of online undergraduate learners in the United States, adjusted R[superscript 2] = 0.611, F(2, 81) = 66.209, p &lt; 0.001. The model accounted for 61.1% of the variance in learners' overall well-being. Both predictors considered individually within the model were statistically significant: Cognitive Reappraisal was a significant direct (positive) predictor of overall Well-being: [beta] = 0.597, t = 6.75, p &lt; 0.001, whereas Expressive Suppression was a significant inverse (negative) predictor of online undergraduate learners' overall Well-being: [beta] = -0.260, t = -2.93, p = 0.004. These findings point to the need to strengthen online undergraduate learners' emotional regulation as a means to enhance their well-being.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical linear modeling techniques were used to explored individual and contextual factors of emotion regulation in a sample of 2074 adolescents from grade 7 through grade 12 and 54 head teachers in China mainland. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R) were administered among students and Multi-Dimensional Emotional Empathy Scale (MDEES) among head teachers. Results showed that at the student level, Effortful Control and Affiliativeness were positively related to adolescents' reappraisal whereas Surgency was inversely correlated with reappraisal after gender, grade level and parent's education were controlled. And Negative Affect (NA) positively predicted suppression. At the teacher level, teachers' Emotional Contagion promoted the impact of adolescent Surgency on reappraisal after teaching age was controlled. In addition, Responsive Crying, Emotional Attention and Feeling for Others enhanced the influence of NA upon Suppression among teachers. However, Positive Sharing weakened the negative association between NA and Suppression. These findings expand the understanding of the role of teacher empathy in adolescents' emotional development, and have important implications for classroom management and teacher empathy training.",

Participants expressed hopes that meditation would help them manage stress and anxiety, improve their focus and relationships, and support their personal growth and motivation. With respect to lived experiences of formal meditation, we found that without explicit prompting, approximately 86% of coded phrases reflected dimensions of experience that could be mapped within the matrix, suggesting its efficacy for coding. Furthermore, almost all participants attributed mindfulness to improving their general wellness, with dereification, breathing, and nonaversive affect frequently mentioned as key factors leading to these improvements. Additionally, consistent with the neurophenomenological aims of the matrix, we list cognitive outcomes and neurophysiological mechanisms potentially attributable to the nature of selected appraisal statements by participants.",

Participants received eight face-to-face sessions of manualized Internet-supported CBT for problem drinking with or without trauma-focused emotion regulation skills (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy [TARGET]). Both interventions were associated with sustained (at one-month follow-up) reductions in self-reported drinking frequency, drinking-related impairment, and heavy drinking in the past week, as well as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD symptoms, and improvement in self-reported emotion regulation. The enhanced intervention was associated with significantly greater sustained reductions in complex PTSD symptoms and resulted in medium/large effect size reductions in days of alcohol use (versus small effects by CBT). Emotion regulation enhancement of CBT for college student problem drinkers with interpersonal trauma histories warrants further investigation.",

The current study tested whether teachers' cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, occupational burnout, and life satisfaction in the fall were related to the level, and trajectory across the school year, of three indicators of student well-being: student-reported positive outlook, student-reported emotional distress, and peer-reported prosocial behavior. Multilevel growth modeling was employed to examine data from 15 elementary teachers and their 320 students. Teachers' emotion regulation skills and life satisfaction were associated with students' well-being: when teachers used cognitive reappraisal, students reported low emotional distress; when teachers used expressive suppression, students reported a less positive outlook and peers reported few prosocial behaviors; teachers' life satisfaction was associated with high levels of prosocial behavior. Effects on the trajectory of student well-being were not significant. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology&quot; v69 Article 101151 2020.]",

The present study explores the associations between teachers' five broad personality traits (known as the 'Big Five'), emotion regulation (suppression and reappraisal), and mood. Data collected from a sample of 113 Israeli teachers were analysed using structural equation modelling analysis and cluster analysis. Path model analysis indicated that suppression mediates the relations between teachers' conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism on one hand, and their negative mood on the other, and that reappraisal mediates the relations between teachers' conscientiousness and neuroticism on one hand, and their positive mood on the other. Cluster analysis revealed associations between three personality types of teachers with their emotion regulation and mood.

In this study, we attempted to induce persistence and flexibility states by having participants engage in 2 creativity tasks (remote associates task and alternative uses task) and 2 meditation techniques (focused-attention meditation and open-monitoring meditation), to study the neural correlates of these metacontrol states and test the metacontrol model of creativity (MCC). Results show that brain areas known to be modulated by both frontal and striatal dopamine were activated in conditions that are thought to call for persistence, particularly the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal ganglia, indicating goal-related selective attention and top-down control. In contrast, conditions that call for flexibility showed brain activation in areas of the default mode network, suggesting reduced top-down control. This pattern was much clearer for the creativity tasks than meditation. Notably, we did not find significant effects when contrasting the 2 meditation techniques and when looking at brain activation overlap between meditation and creativity at the whole-brain level. Finally, the examination of the MCC provided partial supporting evidence for the model, but its prediction for the left inferior frontal gyrus showed the exact opposite result, which calls for clarification in future research.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent among obese individuals, with a complex and bidirectional relationship wherein obesity not only serves as a primary risk factor for OSA but also exacerbates its severity. This interconnection may be influenced by a set of shared genes; however, the molecular mechanisms linking obesity and OSA remain poorly characterized. This study aims to explore the molecular signatures and mechanisms underlying obesity-related genes in OSA. We analyzed gene expression data from the GSE135917 dataset (training dataset) to identify obesity-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OSA patients. Functional enrichment analyses and machine learning approaches were employed to explore associated biological pathways and develop predictive models. The findings were subsequently validated in an independent dataset, GSE38792. A total of 25 significant DEGs were identified, with 13 genes upregulated and 12 downregulated in OSA patients. Functional enrichment analysis revealed associations with insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and Toll-like receptor signaling. Machine learning models highlighted XRCC4 and ARL6 as potential diagnostic biomarkers, validated in the independent GSE38792 dataset. XRCC4's role in DNA repair may be compromised by obesity-related inflammation and oxidative stress, while ARL6 is implicated in adipocyte function and intracellular signaling. Our findings contribute to the understanding of obesity-related genes in OSA, proposing XRCC4 and ARL6 as novel biomarkers. This study underscores the complexity of the interactions between obesity and OSA, paving the way for future research into their shared molecular pathways.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms, alexithymia, emotion regulation difficulties and empathy in adolescents with social anxiety disorder and to compare the findings with healthy controls. Our study included a total of 100 adolescents aged 12-18 years, consisting of 50 with social anxiety disorder (SAD) who applied to the child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic between June 2022 and November 2022, and 50 healthy controls. Participants were evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory, Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Basic Empathy Scale. Alexithymia, depressive symptoms and emotion regulation difficulties were significantly higher in adolescents diagnosed with social anxiety disorder compared to healthy controls, but no significant difference was found in empathy skills. The severity of social anxiety disorder was significantly related to depressive symptoms, alexithymia, and emotion regulation difficulties. Logistic regression analysis revealed maternal age, depressive symptoms, and alexithymia as the factors associated with social anxiety disorder in adolescents. Our study shows that depressive symptoms, alexithymia, and emotion regulation difficulties may be observed in adolescents with social anxiety disorder, and it is important to consider these factors in clinical assessment and intervention processes.",

    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is typically treated with medications however psychological and psychosocial interventions are recommended for symptoms that persist despite pharmacological treatment. This study aims to review randomized controlled trials focusing on the psychological and psychosocial interventions in the treatment of ADHD. Eight databases were searched using keyword pairs \"ADHD\" and \"therapy\", \"ADHD\" and \"psychological treatment\", \"ADHD\" and \"psychosocial treatment\", \"ADHD\" and \"CBT\", \"attention deficit\" and \"therapy\", \"attention deficit\" and \"psychological treatment\", \"attention deficit\" and \"psychosocial treatment\", \"attention deficit\" and \"CBT\". The search was conducted at March 2022. Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 51% included the child and adolescent age group, 49% included the adult age. In 87% of these studies, psychosocial interventions, when implemented in addition to medication, resulted in significant improvements in ADHD symptoms. The results indicate that the use of psychosocial interventions, in addition to medical approaches, makes significant contributions to the treatment of ADHD. There is a need for studies investigating the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of ADHD in Turkiye.",

    "abstract": "Today, rapidly advancing artificial intelligence technologies provide significant changes in the health field. These technologies, which have a wide range of applications in nursing practices, enhance the quality of healthcare and make the care process more efficient. Therefore, nurses' attitudes towards artificial intelligence and the effective use and adoption of these technologies in patient care are significant. In this study, two hypotheses were tested: (1) whether cognitive flexibility is associated with positive/negative attitudes toward artificial intelligence, and (2) whether emotion regulation is associated with positive/negative attitudes toward artificial intelligence. This study employed a correlational and cross-sectional research design. It was completed with 377 nurses working in a province in the East of Turkey who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. Data were collected using the Introductory Information Form, Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale, Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, and Emotion Regulation Scale. These measurement tools were administered to the nurses using the face-to-face interview method. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the data. As a result of the multiple regression analyses conducted, it was found that cognitive flexibility and reappraisal together were associated with 7% of the variance in positive attitudes toward artificial intelligence (F<sub>(2, 374)</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.961, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), while they explained 4% of the variance in negative attitudes (F<sub>(2, 374)</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;7.098, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). In both of the tested models, reappraisal was found to be significantly associated with the attitudes, whereas cognitive flexibility was not. The study concludes that nurses' emotional regulation skills play an important role in shaping their attitudes toward artificial intelligence, while cognitive flexibility does not contribute significantly. Nurses with higher emotional regulation skills tend to report a more positive attitude toward artificial intelligence. In this respect, education and awareness programs prioritizing the improvement of these skills in nurses may contribute to the adoption of artificial intelligence technologies.",

This confusing but critically necessary process can influence college planning and enrollment decisions, post-college employment, and other important life choices, such as enrolling in graduate school, buying a home, or getting married. There is a gap in financial literacy for students that must be fixed so they better understand the financial aid process and its implications. This report shares: (1) students' perceptions on financial aid, loans, and the repayment process; and (2) recommendations for higher education institutions, high schools, and adults to help increase financial literacy.

A transformational learning program was designed including activities in the classroom as well as outside activities. They incorporated cognitive, affective, and conative aspects of student behaviors, aiming to effectively transform their impulse-buying behaviors. The initial test from the six-week pilot program shows changes in awareness and with some consumption behaviors toward less impulse buying. With a longer time frame in future programs, positive behavioral changes are likely to be more prominent. Implications abound for mindfulness-based transformational learning programs in business education that effect sustainable behaviors of students as our young generation members.",

Using the 1998-2016 Survey of Consumer Finances data, we show that American families have increasingly engaged in financially more intensive parenting but that there are substantial differences by wealth and race-ethnicity. Over time, White families above median wealth accumulate more financial assets and education savings as well as less education debt for children. In contrast, Black and Hispanic families across the wealth distribution have low financial assets and education savings for children. In addition, for Black families across the wealth distribution education debt has grown to substantial amounts. These findings suggest that the contemporary norm of intensive parenting has unequal financial manifestations, which have likely contributed to the widening of wealth and racial inequalities, especially between White and Black child households.",

Our systematic review of these sources leads to two key findings: (1) Textbooks are similar in how they represent fiscal policy yet treat the federal budget, deficit, and debt differently across the sample, and (2) Textbooks treat the federal budget, budget deficit, and national debt as theoretical, without an examination of values and systemic electoral and budgetary politics. These findings lead us to argue that curriculum is needed that will permit a careful examination of how everyday citizens can gain knowledge, acknowledge values, and work towards a reasoned and reality-based view of what is at stake with regard to these issues in the 21st Century.

    "abstract": "High levels of student debt can hamper recent graduates as they start their adult lives and careers, influence their choice of job, location, or the decision to pursue further education (Asher 2009). At the same time, student loans are a vital source of financing for students looking to pursue higher education and, if managed appropriately, student loan debt is generally a worthwhile investment that enables individuals to receive the skills and training they need to be competitive in a dynamic global economy. In addition to decisions about paying for higher education, students face other financial choices while in college, such as deciding whether to take on consumer debt as well as selecting and managing transaction account products. As students leave college and transition to the workplace, they are faced with a series of important financial decisions on everything from budgeting to securing health insurance to saving for retirement. Possessing the skills, information, and tools necessary to make effective financial decisions will help to ensure that young people are able to make the right decisions before and after college so that they can begin to build their financial futures. To address these needs, this report has been prepared by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission according to Section 1042 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 and describes the state of financial education among students at covered educational institutions. The report describes current efforts to enhance financial education in a number of institutions with respect to student understanding of financial aid, along with other financial education topics at two critical junctures: (1) Choosing Where to Go and How to Finance Postsecondary Education; and (2) Making Sound Financial Decisions When Enrolled and Beyond.

    "abstract": "Most salient financial literacy frameworks and curricula mainly focus on teaching and learning of simple money management. However, the financial demands placed on individuals today include much more complicated matters, such as buying a home and saving for retirement. Furthermore, financial literacy gives rise to normative questions such as what responsibility should be placed on individuals. In educational terms, this creates an alignment problem where the hopes and expectations placed in financial literacy as mass-education is not met by desirable results. This article uses previous results and the construct of powerful knowledge to discuss how financial literacy education in upper secondary school can benefit from an incorporation into social studies, which is an existing school subject in many educational systems. Findings include that teachers can utilize their existing teaching competence to also teach financial literacy. However, to accomplish results, both curricula and syllabi must guide teachers to abandon the focus on money management to instead focus on teaching students concerning the financial, economic and political issues that affect personal finances, yet at the same time can be affected by democratic decisions. Implications for financial literacy teaching and learning are discussed using the concept Powerful Financial Literacy.",

After controlling for self-selection bias through propensity score matching, the findings show that receiving financial advice is associated positively with the likelihood of saving for children's college education. Other findings reveal that seeking specific types of financial advice relating to savings/investment, insurance, and tax planning is positively associated with a household's decision to allocate money for their children's postsecondary education. The ensuing discussion highlights that policies incentivizing households to seek financial advice could promote college savings and contribute to reduction in student loan dependence.",

Results suggest that perceptions of debt are important in understanding financial well-being, but these perceptions need to be considered alongside of individual differences in anxiety, optimism, and parental teaching. Further, regression analyses highlighted differences between predictors of perceived financial well-being and more and less frequent money saving behaviors, which may indicate different paths for intervention. Specifically, students reporting engaging in less common financial strain behaviors appear to have more objective financial difficulties, whereas students reporting more common financial strain behaviors report more factors that suggest difficulty with money management skills and those with lower levels of perceived financial well-being report higher levels of worry. Mediational analyses further indicated a potential role for parental intervention to improve perceived financial well-being and decrease unhealthy responses to financial strain.",

    "abstract": "Due to the increased financial pressure--exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic--that students in higher education need to endure, considerable attention is being drawn towards the determinants of student financial anxiety. A conflicting picture has been captured about financial literacy, which has been shown to either be associated with better financial well-being or to be unrelated to financial stress. While discerning between financial knowledge ('objective' financial literacy) and perceived ability to manage personal finances ('subjective' financial literacy), this study also explores the impact that students' attitudes towards debt may exert on their financial anxiety. In a sample of 174 university students from the UK, we measured students' financial anxiety, objective and subjective financial literacy, attitudes towards debt and perceived impact of COVID-19 on financial behaviour. Bayesian analyses revealed that only attitudes towards debt and perception of the impact of the pandemic predicted students' financial anxiety. While the evidence in regard to financial literacy was inconclusive, mediation analyses showed that objective financial literacy indirectly impacted financial anxiety by increasing fear of debt. The findings suggest that students' financial anxiety may be reduced by adopting strategies that focus on the subjective perception of debt and of economic circumstances.",

Professionally, financial management has been identified as an instrumental activity of daily living, and recent research has examined how occupational therapy has helped clients with these skills. Personally, occupational therapy students may face higher debt levels due to degree escalation and economic changes. The study aimed to determine the level of understanding of financial literacy among matriculating occupational therapy students in a combined baccalaureate and entry-level master's program. Nineteen occupational therapy students completed a virtual survey distributed through Google Forms. The survey included demographic questions, the Financial Self-Efficacy Scale (FSES), and a 16-question survey about financial habits and knowledge from open-sourced questions. Descriptive statistics were performed using SPSS version 29. Results showed that most students had a general understanding of financial literacy, but they could not correctly apply the concepts to real-life questions. The overall mean for the FSES was 13.05 (SD = 4.28). For financial habits, most students reported they did not have an emergency fund or a budget but had checked their credit scores. Most students responded incorrectly or were unsure about most financial knowledge questions. No one answered all the financial knowledge questions correctly. Financial literacy is needed in occupational therapy education to prepare students to transition with skills that will benefit clients and themselves.",

    "abstract": "Student loans are likely to remain a prominent instrument for paying for college in Texas, a necessary financial tool for low- and moderate-income students. As college costs rise and growing enrollments further stretch grant funds, the policy challenge is to assist students in determining the appropriate level of student loans for their individual situation. The process begins with quality college outreach services to high school students. Financial literacy training can help students manage their finances and plan their careers wisely, providing reasonable loan debt and salary expectations. Professional, qualified loan counseling can help students better understand their loan obligations, and a neutral party can advocate on behalf of students and provide essential delinquency and default prevention services to keep them in repayment. Although they carry some risk, student loans are a necessary tool for promoting college access and success, allowing students to enroll full time and work a minimum number of hours. This can enhance the quality of the educational experience and reduce the number of years to degree, saving money for both the student and the state.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and risk-taking behavior in the stock market for both graduates and undergraduates. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted two surveys on two groups: graduates and undergraduates. The questionnaires were sent to the two groups via &quot;Google Form&quot;. The surveys were undertaken from March to October 2021, with final data on 500 undergraduates and 400 graduates. The three techniques used are multiple linear regression (MLR), structural equation model (SEM) and ordinal logit regression (OLR) to examine the causal relationships. Findings: Based on survey data on 400 graduate and 500 undergraduate students, our results show that financial literacy is positively associated with risk-taking behavior (i.e. use of debt and willingness to use debt) after controlling for demographics. Graduates with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to use debt. Undergraduates with higher levels of financial literacy are more willing to use debt. In addition, parental education has a significant moderating effect on the association between financial literacy and debt use among undergraduate students. The results are robust compared to the alternatives. Research limitations/implications: Although this study finds a positive association between financial literacy and risk-taking behavior among graduates and undergraduates, and these results are robust to the alternatives, the scope of this study is limited and only focuses on Vietnam. Hence, it needs to be expanded overseas. Next, graduates may make investment decisions based on stock prices or valuations, and as a result, the link between financial literacy and stock valuations should be investigated in subsequent research. Last but not least, further studies should also examine the digital financial literacy level of the younger generation, as it plays an important role in the digital age. Practical implications: First, this study finds that higher financial literacy tends to use more debt, implying that financially literate people know how to use debt smartly to earn more profits. Second, students with higher-educated parents are less likely to use debt for stock investment, meaning that parents help students avoid possible risks while in the university. Finally, female graduates and college students all perform lower in financial literacy than their male counterparts. This can create a larger gender gap in financial literacy between women and men, particularly, in a society in which men often play the leading role in the family. As a result, it calls for policymakers, educators and parents to pay more attention to improving financial literacy among girls and women in general. Originality/value: This study has three contributions. First, this is the first study to examine the impact of financial literacy on risk-taking behavior between two groups of graduates and undergraduates. The results show that individuals with a higher level of financial literacy are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior (i.e. debt use) in terms of the stock market. Recent research, for example, Phung et al. (2022), examines investors' informal debt (from families and friends), while this study investigates graduates' debt use (from brokerage firms). Second, parental education is a significant mediator between college students' financial literacy and debt use. The literature on parental socialization mainly documents parents' direct influence on children's financial knowledge and performance (Shim et al., 2010; Phung, 2023). Unlike previous research, this study finds that parental education plays a moderating role between college students' financial literacy and their risk-taking behavior. Finally, three methods and multiple models are used to test causal relationships. The results are robust compared to the alternatives.",

    "abstract": "University students and university personnel are important contributors to the economy of the United States regarding excessive student loan debt. As such, a lack of financial literacy is a significant problem. The purpose of this single descriptive qualitative case study was to describe the experiences of certain individual university students about their financial knowledge of their student loan debt. Bandura's social learning theory and Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory was used to analyze the results of this study. The research questions asked how university students describe their experiences regarding student loan debt and their financial acuity, and how do university students' parents describe their experiences with student loan debt? This study examined students' perceptions and experiences regarding financial literacy and money management related to student loan debt. Data for this study included interviews with 10 borrowers, one college financial counselor, field notes, observations of information available to students on student loans, reviewed reports, and personal journals or diaries on their debt. Open and axial coding revealed five themes: (a) financial skills, (b) budgeting, (c) initial debt, (d) benefits, and (e)challenges. This study could contribute to social change by persuading the implementation of financial literacy training through independent courses or by incorporating lessons into the core curriculum in institutions - similar to this one but using financial knowledge of student loan debt. The study could contribute to financial change by helping university students acknowledge financial challenges; they may alleviate stress and reclaim control of their financial knowledge of student debt and personal lives.

    "abstract": "The lack of basic financial knowledge and skills among youth today is of national concern. American high school students routinely fail tests that evaluate their financial knowledge and are ill-prepared to face important decisions about borrowing, saving, investing, and planning for their financial futures. The consequences of these low levels of financial literacy can be significant. Low financial literacy is correlated with a host of negative credit behaviors, including higher borrowing rates, mortgage delinquency, and home foreclosure. Financial literacy also influences important decisions about education. Youth with no savings account are less likely to attend college, and for those in college, financial stress and credit card debt have been tied to an increased likelihood of missing class and dropping out. States have a vested interest in the economic health of their citizens, making low financial literacy an important issue for policymakers. Public education before high school graduation can play a role in improving financial literacy and promoting sound financial decision-making. Yet many--if not most--financial education efforts focus on college students and adults. Such efforts are often reactive rather than proactive, and may be too little too late. In contrast, earlier education initiatives during and before high school can target individuals before they have had the opportunity to get into serious financial trouble and become entrenched in negative behaviors. Research suggests that introducing children and adolescents to general concepts, such as responsible spending and good saving habits, may pay dividends later in life by establishing the building blocks for financial well-being in adulthood. This review first presents a holistic framework of financial literacy that reflects the various ways it has been defined by researchers and practitioners. It then examines state efforts to incorporate financial literacy education into their K-12 standards, mandates, and curricula, and review research on the effectiveness of these policies on student outcomes. Finally, the authors highlight a number of financial education organizations, programs and resources--both public and private--that have had positive impact on K-12 students, and describe their design and influence.",

    "abstract": "For students with a significant amount of student loan debt, the excitement of graduating from college can be overshadowed by feelings of anxiety and fear. Debt perception is about more than the cost of a college degree, the amount of financial aid received, or the value families place on education. In this article, the author tells a story about David, a student, who graduated from college with more than $85,000 of student loan debt. He uses this story to define debt perception as, a psychological attitude based on an individual's history and beliefs around money and debt influenced by the values and habits of families and the characteristics of the communities where they grew up. The author goes into detail about the concept of financial literacy, which is often thought of as an individual or family responsibility, however, individuals and families, especially people of color or those from low-income households, may not have the ability or resources to teach financial literacy. All these points are detailed through following David's story of his goal of seeking higher education.",

These concepts are important to teaching about economics in the United States since they lie at the center of contemporary debates about the health of the nation's economy and its long-term viability. Our research discovered broad variation among states in the degree of specificity about teaching these economic concepts. We discuss specific ways in which some of the economic concepts found in state social studies standards might be used to infuse content about federal budget, federal debt, and budget deficit into high school social studies courses, critical topics in light of contemporary debates about the future of American entitlement programs and the federal government.

    "abstract": "As the funding environment for higher education and theological education changes, an increasing number of graduate theological students hold student loan debt that will follow them well into their postgraduation working lives (Delisle, 2014). This study reports the attitudes about money voiced by master of divinity students at one mainline Protestant seminary. Using interactive qualitative analysis, researchers discovered seven key themes that function as a conceptual system (mind map). Participants reported that the three themes that exerted the most influence in the system were beliefs (how money fits in with other convictions held by students), societal impact (what students think about the results of government policies and actions of private firms regarding money), and financial awareness (how students know about their income, expenses, and obligations). These themes influenced what students thought about debt, saving, giving money away, and their emotions about money. Most participants voiced explicitly theological beliefs about money, including a variety of reasons for their own giving. The article discusses these findings in relation to other research about student debt and Christian attitudes toward financial giving. Recommendations arising from these findings include providing explicit curricular attention in theological schools to money as a problem for Christians and to developing students' financial literacy. Theological schools may benefit from exploring the relationship between the institutional need to admit tuition-paying students and the needs of churches for full-time pastors. Areas for further research include the relationship between a sense of Christian vocation and money, as well as what, if anything, is distinctive about donating money to explicitly Christian organizations.",

A survey research design was used for the study. The study was carried out in the North-west zone of Nigeria. The population of the study was 219 Business Education Lecturers in 10 Colleges of Education. The entire population was studied since it was small and manageable. Two research questions were answered and one null hypothesis was tested at 0.05 level of significance and 202 degrees of freedom. A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data for the study. The questionnaire items were structured on a 5-point Likert scale. A total of 204 copies of the questionnaire were retrieved from the respondents for analysis. The data collected were analyzed using Mean statistic to answer the research questions, while analysis of variance was used to test the hypothesis at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that all the items of retail store location and design were accepted by the respondents as having influence on the impulse buying behaviour of consumers. The findings also revealed that there was no significant difference in the Mean responses of Business Education Lecturers with regards to their ranks on the influence on all the retail store items on consumer impulse buying behaviour. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended, among others, that retailers should adopt the retail store variables identified in this study in order to boost their trade and provide a satisfying shopping experience for their customers.",

    "abstract": "For many people in the United States, college paves the way to the middle class. Programs like Pell Grants and government backed loans help students afford a college degree. These programs help young Americans gain the skills they need to get a good job. But too many Ohioans struggle to afford college and pay back student loans. The Trump administration's budget proposal and the resolution passed by the House Budget Committee dismantle key college access and affordability programs. Both proposals slash Pell Grants, the most important source of need-based aid for students. The proposals also cut interest-free loans for undergraduate students in school, and eliminate some debt relief programs. These programs ensure that college is attainable for low- and middle-income Ohioans. Every year hundreds of thousands of working-class students attending Ohio public and private universities use these programs to make college more affordable. Ohio is one of the worst states in the nation in student debt burden. These cuts will force Ohioans to take on even more debt to get a degree--making our communities and economies less competitive. The House Budget Resolution sets Congressional funding priorities for the next 10 years. It calls for massive giveaways to the wealthy and corporations and deep cuts to programs that pay for college. Members of the Budget Committee voted to slash $236 billion in mandatory education spending. They targeted programs that help the most people afford college: Pell Grants, subsidized loans, income-based repayment plans, and public service loan forgiveness. This report examines the programs and makes recommendations how Congressional representatives can protect student financial aid and debt relief programs.

    "abstract": "Background/purpose: Financial literacy is essential for adolescents navigating complex digital finance. However, gaps persist due to inconsistent formal education, varied parental influence, and uncritical digital exposure. This study explores the financial education experiences, financial management behaviors, and digital financial misconceptions of high school students using a qualitative phenomenological approach. Materials/methods: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with three students and their parents and analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: The findings reveal that financial information obtained through social media was found to be more dominant than that from formal school curricula. Students exhibited impulsive spending behaviors, limited understanding of digital financial risks, and varied financial decisions influenced by family norms. Parental involvement emerged as a crucial factor in shaping students' financial attitudes and behaviors. This study contributes to the field by proposing an integrative literacy framework that connects formal education, parental guidance, and digital financial realities to better prepare youth for informed decision-making in an increasingly digital economy. Conclusion: This study highlights that while formal, informal, and non-formal financial education positively impact students' financial literacy, gaps remain due to limited school education and varying parental guidance. Social media and digital platforms are major financial learning sources for Generation Z, but they also introduce risks of digital financial misconceptions. Students face challenges in financial management, such as poor record-keeping, inadequate saving, and impulse spending. Misunderstandings about digital transactions, along with rising online fraud, further complicate financial decisions. Parental involvement is crucial for financial independence, and family well-being is tied to financial stability and communication. The study calls for a comprehensive financial literacy program that combines formal education, parental involvement, and digital financial risk awareness to promote responsible financial behaviors among high school students.",

The study explored learning experiences that generated changes in money management behaviors and sought evidence of transformational learning in a nonformal education setting. Themes from participants' interview answers appear under three core themes and seventeen sub-themes. Core theme 1: Indicators of money-management behaviors: five sub-themes included: examine and plan savings habits, track spending habits and rethink before buying, learn how credit works, learn how to pay off credit, and avoid adding new credit. Core theme 2: Steps in transformational learning: six sub-themes included: experienced dilemmas resulting from high debt and low income, accomplishment via experiencing improved money management habits, inform, write about, and discuss money issues, identify irresponsible and out of control financial habits, become confident and self-accountable, and positioned to lead others. Core theme 3: Perceived transformational learning: six sub-themes included improved self-awareness and financial control, experienced dilemmas resulting from loss of income and high debt, experienced discontent with lack of knowledge, experienced discontent with unclear goals, experienced discontent with unmanaged credit, and plan spending, budget, and then act. Young, low-income credit union members changed their money management behaviors and experienced transformational learning as a result of their financial education experience at Denver Community Credit Union. A set of teaching/learning sequences are proposed and explained. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "abstract": "In this letter, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) responds to questions about the effects of President Biden's August 24, 2022, announcement on executive actions affecting student loans. The cost of outstanding student loans will increase by $20 billion because an action suspended payments, interest accrual, and involuntary collections from September 2022 to December 2022, the CBO estimates. After accounting for those suspensions, CBO estimates that the cost of student loans will increase by about an additional $400 billion in present value as a result of the action canceling up to $10,000 of debt issued on or before June 30, 2022, for borrowers with income below specified limits and an additional $10,000 for such borrowers who also received at least one Pell grant. The cost of debt cancellation is the present value of the borrowers' projected repayments of student debt before accounting for the cancellation minus the present value of repayments after doing so. CBO's estimates are highly uncertain. The most uncertain components are the projections of how much borrowers would repay if the executive action canceling debt had not been undertaken and how much they will repay under that executive action. Those projections depend in part on future economic conditions and on how the terms of loans might be modified in the future.",

It works from a conceptual model that predicts that attitudes will be partly determined by a range of social factors, mediated through personality and 'financial literacy'. Path analysis is used to explore this model. The proposed model was found to be basically sound, with some notable negative findings. Socio-economic status was found to have a negligible role in determining debt attitudes, while the role of financial literacy was limited to reducing the likelihood of seeing debt as useful for lifestyle expenditure. Debt anxiety was found to be higher among students with a general predisposition to anxiety and inversely related to viewing student debt as a form of educational investment. It is concluded that student debt attitudes are multidimensional and individualised, challenging simplistic ideas of debt aversion in earlier literature.",

    "abstract": "College has never been so necessary or so expensive for Americans. Rising costs, state disinvestment, declining household incomes, and grant aid that has not kept pace lead more students to borrow, and borrow more, to go to school. While federal student loans are the safest option for students who need to borrow, rising student loan debt has repercussions for both individuals and the broader economy. In addition to the severe consequences for those who default, student loan debt--even low debt when paired with low earnings--can hold borrowers back from starting a family, buying a home, saving for retirement, starting a business or farm, or saving for their own children's education. While not a solution for rising costs or debt, income-driven repayment (IDR) for federal student loans gained broad support over a decade ago from lenders, students, schools, and both Republicans and Democrats. Since Congress passed the first widely available plan in 2007, IDR has become an increasingly critical option for students who have to borrow to afford college, and it continues to have strong bipartisan support. IDR plans now help millions of borrowers stay on top of their loans and avoid default, providing the assurance of manageable monthly payments tied to their income and family size, as well as a light at the end of the tunnel so that student loan payments do not last the rest of their lives. In addition to providing repayment relief to borrowers struggling with low incomes relative to their debt, the availability of more affordable payments through IDR can help allay well-documented fears about college costs and debt that keep some students from ever attempting college and push others to drop out before completing. However, the range of IDR plans available today--five of them, each with varying eligibility requirements, costs, and benefits--is confusing and contributes to under-enrollment among the borrowers who may need IDR the most. To better serve both borrowers and taxpayers, IDR must be both streamlined and improved. Needed improvements include simplifying the annual income recertification process in IDR, better targeting the benefits of IDR, and preventing forgiven debt in IDR from being treated as taxable income. This report details a proposal to streamline the multiple IDR plans into one improved plan that caps monthly payments at 10% of income, provides tax-free loan forgiveness after 20 years of payments, targets benefits to borrowers who need help the most, and prevents borrowers with high incomes and high debt from receiving loan forgiveness when they could have afforded to pay more.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have focused heavily on the astronomical student loan debt number in the United States of America and the overall expense of higher education; however, few studies have focused on the financial literacy of higher education students and what financial knowledge the individuals possess who were key members of the community who were adding to the overall student loan debt number. The purpose of this study was to examine the mindset of higher education graduates from public universities within the last 10 years (2012-2022) about factors that have contributed to the overall student loan debt number in the United States with a specific focus on the financial literacy of these students. Specific research questions were developed to study college graduates and their financial thought processes on selecting their college, payment plan, major, and financial repercussions of these decisions. I utilized the snowball and convenience sampling methods in this qualitative study to obtain 14 research participants who graduated from public universities between 2012-2022 to personally interview about their financial literacy, knowledge, habits, and influences in high school, during their higher education journey, and post-graduation. The data analysis showed individuals were more aware of the cost of college and student loan debt than previous research conducted. Multiple things played into this, such as parental influence and self-awareness. Implications of these findings and recommendations for further research were discussed.

    "abstract": "In the wake of the deep recession of 2008 and 2009, there has been increased concern over the current level of financial literacy among American citizens. For many, this concern extends to our college students getting ready to enter the real world as they leave college life behind. This study looks at the preparedness of college students to manage their financial affairs both as young adults and as citizens able to effectively plan for typical life-changing events. This body of knowledge usually includes a solid understanding of investing, insurance, risk, credit, debt, buying a home, retirement planning, wills and living wills, and cash management. The focus of this study was undergraduates at two smaller private higher education institutions in New England and a public community college in South Carolina. This study evaluated the financial literacy skills of college students as measured by a well-regarded questionnaire developed and used by the Jump$tart coalition. The study quantified the financial literacy of students at the three institutions, and looked for statistically significant differences based on gender, age, college major, and first-generation college students. Few differences were found among these categories. There was not a statistically significant difference in financial literacy between men and women. Age was a factor in financial literacy, but not a major one. Business and STEM majors outperformed other majors, but the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, no difference was found in the scores of first generation students versus non first generation. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

However, a paucity of literature addresses occupational therapists' student loan debt burden. This study was conducted to describe the context of occupational therapists who have significant debt and the impact on their personal and professional lives. This study employed an exploratory sequential design in which quantitative data from a survey was collected first, followed by the collection of qualitative data from participant interviews to study occupational therapy graduates who accrued more than $100,000 in student loan debt. Forty-four occupational therapy graduates from Creighton University completed a survey asking questions about personal choices in relation to debt. Of these respondents, 20 completed a follow-up semi-structured interview. Six themes related to the effect of debt on personal lives emerged from the interviews, including: 1) mental health, 2) future purchasing power, 3) relationships, 4) maintaining life work balance, 5) frugality, and 6) financial literacy. Four themes related to effect of debt on professional lives were: 1) job limitations, 2) stuck, 3) career choice, and 4) salary dissonance. Future research should further examine how programs can address these concerns to promote student and practitioner well-being.",

Long-term financial behavior referred to retirement saving and investing behavior, whereas short-term financial behavior referred to spending and emergency saving behavior. In the full sample, both objective and subjective financial literacy variables were positively associated with long- and short-term financial behaviors. In the age subsamples, subjective financial knowledge or confidence was more strongly related to long- and short-term financial behavior than either objective financial knowledge or subjective financial management ability in the younger age groups. In the older age groups, objective financial knowledge was more strongly related to long-term financial behavior than either of the other two measures of financial literacy.",

By this, the learner's micro level of acting out numeracy is brought to the fore, revealing the multidimensional features of a numerate environment and of adults' numeracy strategies in order to handle financial matters in daily life. The analysis identified the common ground of the most significant competency domains of financial literacy according to both data sets (revenues, expenses and consumption, and budget management) and identified the numeracy strategies developed and used. In conclusion, the authors suggest further discussion of vulnerability as a relative and relational category that supports a pedagogical understanding of adult basic education and adult numeracy with a resource-oriented perspective.",

    "abstract": "The rising costs of college attendance and changes in financial aid packages leave students with little option other than to incur a debt of some amount. Unfortunately, colleges often fail to provide adequate financial literacy and student loan information so prospective students planning to attend college can make informed decisions. Student loans may seem attractive in the short term because, unlike other loans, repayment does not begin immediately. However, the accrual of student loan debt leads to long-term financial consequences, including the opportunity to build economic wealth after graduation. Utilizing a basic qualitative research design, I explored first-generation community college students' experiences with financial aid, financial literacy, and the challenges and individual circumstances of using student loans to fund expenses related to their postsecondary enrollment. A human capital framework supported students informed financial decision-making experiences to effectively persist confidently in pursuing their educational goals. Collectively, students' detailed statements provided a powerful voice for first-generation students accessing financial resources at the community college. The six themes included (a) Student-Centered, (b) Understanding Consequences of Student Loans, (c) Development of Financial Aid Literacy, (d) Student-Connection, (e) Simplifying Financial Aid Access for Students, and (f) Support From Campus-Based Programs. Findings provide helpful insights for community college practitioners and financial aid administrators. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "abstract": "Increasing arthroplasty volumes are testing health care system capacity, budgets, and workforce resilience. Clinical pathways (CPWs) provide a practical, evidence-based structure that aligns perioperative actions from preparation through follow-up. In this review, we treat three aims as coprimary: quality (patient outcomes and adherence to best practice); resource management and efficiency at the episode level (eg, length of stay, perioperative flow, direct costs); and sustainability, defined as the ability to maintain high-quality services over time by optimizing financial, human, and environmental resources while safeguarding equitable access. This study aimed to describe the main CPW subtypes used in hip and knee arthroplasty and synthesize evidence on their effects on quality of care, resource management, and sustainability. We conducted a narrative review of studies indexed in PubMed and Cochrane (2013-2024) that evaluated CPWs in total hip and knee arthroplasty. Screening and selection were documented with a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-style flow diagram for transparency, and findings were synthesized thematically. Across CPW models, consistent signals of benefit were identified. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways accelerate recovery and enable earlier discharge without increasing complications, often reducing opioid exposure and time to mobilization. Integrated Clinical Pathways improve standardization and multidisciplinary coordination across settings, reducing unwarranted variability and supporting safer transitions of care. Fast-track programs emphasize early mobilization and streamlined perioperative processes, improving patient flow and satisfaction while decreasing length of stay. Outpatient arthroplasty pathways allow same-day discharge in carefully selected, low-risk patients, reducing bed occupancy and freeing inpatient capacity. Virtual clinics support remote follow-up, patient education, and complication surveillance, decreasing unnecessary in-person visits and optimizing clinician time. Collectively, these pathways align quality improvement with sustainability by lowering bed-days, improving adherence to evidence-based practices, and enabling more efficient use of operating rooms, wards, and workforce. This review highlights the importance of CPWs in improving care delivery and patient outcomes in orthopedic surgery. Future efforts should refine CPWs, integrate digital tools and platforms, adopt standardized sustainability metrics, and stay flexible to evolving service demands.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related diseases in women has declined in countries introducing HPV vaccinations for girls but remains high among men. The objective of this study was to compare the health impact and cost-effectiveness of two HPV vaccination strategies in the pre-adolescent Taiwanese population: nonavalent (9vHPV) gender-neutral vaccination (GNV), and 9vHPV female-only vaccination (FOV). A previously validated dynamic transmission model was adapted to the Taiwanese setting. The model had a 100-year time horizon and assumed an 85% vaccination coverage rate for girls and a 50% rate for boys, lifelong duration of vaccine protection, herd immunity, and a discount rate of 3% for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs of vaccination and HPV-related disease (in 2015-2016 new Taiwan dollars [NTD]), QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. Compared to 9vHPV FOV, GNV prevented 572 additional cases of cervical cancer (a 1.0% decrease) and 57,691 cases of genital warts (-12.6%) in women. In men, 26 additional cases of penile cancer were avoided (-6.6%), as well as 179,207 cases of genital warts (-26.7%), 4,955 cases of head and neck cancer (-9.0%), and 3,880 cases of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (-15.8%), by use of the 9vHPV GNV strategy versus FOV. Use of 9vHPV GNV instead of FOV would prevent 229 deaths from cervical cancer in women (a 0.6% decrease) and 3,398 deaths from head and neck cancer in men (-8.3%) over 100 years. The 9vHPV GNV strategy resulted in a savings of NTD 1,574,288,155 (1.9%) in disease management costs compared to the 9vHPV FOV strategy and was predicted to be cost-effective, with an ICER of NTD 606,210/QALY. Compared to a 9vHPV FOV strategy, a 9vHPV GNV strategy for 13-year-old girls and boys would result in incremental public health and economic benefits and would be cost-effective in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Organ allotransplantation remains the gold standard for treating end-stage organ failure, yet the chronic shortage of donor organs limits access to life-saving therapy. Xenotransplantation, particularly the use of genetically modified pigs as organ donors, has emerged as a viable alternative, supported by decades of preclinical research and recent breakthroughs in gene editing and immunosuppressive protocols. The current era of solid organ xenotransplantation began in 2021 with studies involving human recipients who were brain dead and has since progressed to the transplantation of porcine hearts, kidneys, and a liver into living patients. While initial cases were complicated by significant comorbidities and short-term survival, recent xenotransplants in carefully selected patients have yielded improved outcomes. Notably, one recipient of a porcine kidney recently passed the six-month post-transplant mark, an important milestone for the field. Regulatory momentum is also building. In 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved clinical trials led by United Therapeutics and eGenesis targeting patients with end-stage kidney disease. The upcoming 18th&#xa0;Congress of the International Xenotransplantation Association, to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 30 September to 3 October 2025, underscores the global relevance of the current breakthrough. Geneva has historic ties to the field, having hosted key early policy discussions and managed the International Human Xenotransplantation Inventory for over a decade. As xenotransplantation moves into a new clinical era, continued collaboration as well as ethical and regulatory oversight will be essential to guide its safe and effective implementation.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) related healthcare expenditure is expected to rise drastically as the incidence of diabetes associated comorbidities increases. It is vital to maintain an optimum glycaemia for patients with diabetes to reduce the risk of diabetes complications. Given the strong predictive value for diabetes complications, HbA1c remains the gold standard to monitor glycaemic control in contemporary clinical practice. The Primary Technology Enhanced Care (PTEC) Home HbA1c Testing (HAT) Programme is a telehealth programme that is intended to empower low-risk patients to test their HbA1c independently at home, supported with tele-monitoring and review through teleconsultation, saving them up to three clinic visits per year. Given the programme's reliance on active patient involvement, understanding patient experiences within the programme to identify the enablers and barriers of using various PTEC HAT components is important for guiding iterative improvement and informing scale-up strategies. A qualitative study approach was used to explore the in-depth perceptions of the patients who were enrolled into the pilot PTEC HAT programme. The non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework was used to guide the development of topic guide and the analysis. The emergent results were categorised into the enablers and barriers. Coaching by healthcare team and access to supporting materials enabled the patients to complete the programme. The proactive reminder for home HbA1c testing by the in-app chatbot, the flexibility to perform the test round the clock, instant result review and the convenience of teleconsultation following home HbA1c test saved time and reduced clinic visits. Patient characteristic which enabled successful participation included a reasonable level of digital literacy, prior experience with health monitoring, absence of needle-related distress and strong intrinsic motivation. HbA1c reagent storage, syncing results via Bluetooth device, the prolonged onboarding process and the time gap between onboarding and first home-based testing were found to be challenging. PTEC HAT programme was seen as a good alternative to routine clinic care for T2DM. Refinement in the on-boarding process and better support between onboarding and home-based independent testing could improve patient experience and satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Household education debt is closely related to household consumption, and education itself is also a developmental high-quality consumption. Based on the panel data of five phases of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) from 2013 to 2021, this paper explores the impact of households' education debt on improving household consumption enthusiasm and consumption upgrading with households as the basic unit. The study finds that education debt can significantly promote the upgrading of household consumption. Mechanism analysis shows that education debt can promote the upgrading of household consumption by improving the level of Internet consumption, and there are different degrees of moderating effect on household risk attitude. Heterogeneity analysis shows that household education debt has a significant positive effect on the consumption of urban and rural areas, high-financially literate and middle- and low-income households, as well as middle-leveraged households. The conclusions of this study enrich the research on the influencing factors and mechanisms of household consumption upgrading, broaden the research boundary of household debt and consumption, and have important implications for promoting education equity and consumer demand in China.",

    "abstract": "Savings refer to faster relearning upon re-exposure to a previously experienced movement perturbation. One theory posits that the brain recognizes past errors, enabling more efficient learning from them. If this is the case, there should be a modification in the neural response to errors during re-exposure to the perturbation. To investigate this hypothesis, we used fMRI to measure brain activity as participants adapted to a visuomotor perturbation across two sessions spaced one day apart, focusing on neural responses to movement errors. The magnitude of the movement error was incorporated into different types of GLMs to study error-related activation and co-activation (or functional connectivity). We identified a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network involved in processing movement errors during adaptation. We observed strengthened connectivity within this network during re-adaptation, particularly between the cerebellar lobule VI and the ventrolateral thalamus, as well as between the primary somatosensory cortex and the rostral cingulate motor zone. Importantly, participants with the greatest increases in connectivity strength also exhibited the largest amounts of savings. These results establish a link between the brain's ability to represent errors and the phenomenon of savings.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is prevalent in older adults and often coexists with other chronic diseases, increasing healthcare costs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like China and Viet Nam. These nations are experiencing rapid population aging, yet comparative evidence on the economic burden of hypertension-related multimorbidity is lacking. This study aimed to compare the financial burden, measured by out-of-pocket health expenditures (OOPHE) and catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), associated with hypertension and common comorbidities (joint disease, heart disease, and diabetes) among older adults in China and Viet Nam. Researchers analyzed data from national surveys in China (2018) and Viet Nam (2020) for adults aged 60+. They categorized hypertensive individuals by comorbidities and used regression models to assess the link between these disease clusters and OOPHE and CHE, adjusting for socioeconomic factors. CHE was defined as health spending at or above 40% of a household's capacity to pay. Comorbidities were common in both countries. In China, CHE prevalence was highest for individuals with hypertension and heart disease (30.8%), which was the comorbidity posing the greatest financial risk. In Viet Nam, the hypertension-diabetes cluster had the highest CHE risk (13.5%). In China, all comorbidity groups were associated with higher OOPHE. In Viet Nam, however, only the hypertension-diabetes group showed a significant increase in OOPHE. Multimorbidity significantly increases the financial burden for older adults with hypertension, with the key impactful diseases varying by country. Heart disease imposes the greatest burden in China, while diabetes is the primary driver in Viet Nam. Targeted policies, such as improving outpatient coverage and tailoring benefits to common disease combinations, are crucial to protect aging populations in LMICs from financial hardship.",

    "abstract": "Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (<i>ZAP70</i>) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive T<sup>+</sup>B<sup>+</sup>NK<sup>+</sup> combined immunodeficiency characterized by heterogeneous clinical and immunologic phenotypes. Because of the limited number of reported cases, data guiding optimal management and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) strategies remain scarce. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with genetically confirmed <i>ZAP70</i> deficiency treated at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre. Data on pre-HSCT clinical and immunologic features, transplant characteristics, post-HSCT complications, immune reconstitution, and long-term outcomes were recorded. Thirteen patients with a median age at symptom onset of 1 month were identified. The most frequent initial presentations were recurrent respiratory infections and cutaneous manifestations. Autoimmune complications and lymphoproliferation were observed in several patients. Eleven of thirteen patients (84.6%) exhibited profound CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell lymphopenias and two had near-normal CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts with impaired T-cell function. Eleven patients underwent HSCT, including seven from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched family donors, two from one-antigen mismatched related donors, one from a haploidentical mother (matched for graft-versus-host disease risk but mismatched for rejection), and one from an unrelated cord blood donor. Two patients required a second transplant because of poor immune reconstitution. Of the 11 patients who underwent HSCT, 8 (73%) remain alive with a median follow-up of 7 years (range, 1-15), and most demonstrated resolution of clinical manifestations. HSCT remains the only curative treatment for <i>ZAP70</i> deficiency. Myeloablative conditioning regimens appear to promote more robust and durable immune reconstitution. In critically ill patients with severe infections or end-organ damage, reduced-intensity or unconditioned HSCT can be considered as a life-saving approach, although subsequent interventions might be necessary.",

Based on the review of the literature regarding CBRN events, the items were extracted, rewritten, and validated. In the quantitative phase, the validity of the questionnaire was evaluated in terms of face, content, and construct validity, and its reliability was evaluated based on internal consistency and stability (Cronbach's alpha and Interclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC]). The designed questionnaire included 6 dimensions and 65 items. The dimensions included (1) programs and guidelines, treatment of the injured; (2) exercise; (3) decontamination and waste management; (4) education and human resources; (5) prevention, coordination, and security; and (6) PPE. The content and face validity of the questionnaire were approved by the specialists and experts of hospital emergency and health in disasters and emergencies. The content validity ratio was &gt;0.6 for all items. The content validity index was also approved for all items. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient and ICC were respectively 0.977 and 0.972 for the total questionnaire. Hospital Emergency Clinical Staff play a vital role in responding to CBRN events; therefore, policies, programs, coordination efforts, budgets, and other necessary measures are strongly recommended to increase ED clinical staff preparedness against CBRN events.",

    "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) play a crucial role in providing children with profound hearing loss the ability for auditory perception and spoken language development. Following implantation, patients typically undergo a computed tomography (CT) or X-ray examination to assess electrode positions in the cochlea. Besides economic factors, this imposes radiation risks on patients, particularly for younger patients who are more sensitive to its harmful effects. This study aims to evaluate the performance of an impedance telemetry-based estimation algorithm for assessing postoperative CI placement. While the algorithm has been validated in an adult cohort, this research explores its applicability in pediatric patients. The insertion depth estimation algorithm was validated on a dataset of 59 pediatric cases and evaluated using different classification metrics. Impedance telemetry data was combined with demographic data and morphological parameters of the cochlea and used as input data for the algorithm. The algorithm predictions were compared with ground truth labels derived from X-ray and CT scans. The algorithm demonstrated a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.53mm for insertion depth prediction, compared to 1.01mm in the original report. In terms of classification, the algorithm successfully detected all cases with partially inserted electrodes, although three cases were detected as false positives. The results highlight the algorithm's potential for clinical decision support in assessing post-implantation outcomes, monitoring electrode migration, and detecting extracochlear electrodes. A larger dataset with more partial insertion cases would be required for additional training and validation of the algorithm. Assessing electrode placement through impedance measurements would eliminate the need for additional radiography, reducing radiation exposure for future patients while also saving the clinic significant cost and time.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyse and document how Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, transformed its Primary Health Care (PHC) model following the COVID-19 pandemic. The reform involved a shift from a reactive, hospital-centred response to a community-based model focused on prevention, social determinants of health, and local engagement. This study used a qualitative case study design with a comparative and deductive approach, featuring 11 semi-structured interviews with health professionals, decision-makers, and administrative staff, alongside a review of secondary sources, including national and municipal legal framework (such as the Organic Code and the municipal Organic Statute), ordinances, the Municipal Code, and governance documents and accountability reports from three mayoral administrations. Thematic analysis identified key enabling factors and compared Quito's experience with other cities in Ecuador and Latin America. The central innovation was the creation of multidisciplinary Community Health Teams (Equipos de Salud Comunitaria, ESC) assigned to each of Quito's 65 parishes. These teams focused on health promotion, disease prevention, and intersectoral coordination. Their implementation was supported by continuous training, integration of digital tools, community-based communication strategies, and protocols for operating in high-risk environments. A major driver of the reform was the political negotiation to sustain the increased health budget beyond the pandemic, enabling the long-term operation of ESCs. Ensuring the physical safety of health personnel also became a core component of the model, supported by risk mapping, emergency communication systems, and coordination with local security actors. The model was institutionalized through legal frameworks and aligned with national initiatives such as the Healthy Municipalities Programme and Comprehensive Family, Community and Intercultural Health Care Model (MAIS-FCI). The model demonstrated improved territorial access, community trust, and responsiveness amid rising urban violence, but faces limitations in technological infrastructure, monitoring indicators, and long-term sustainability. Quito's experience highlights the potential of decentralised municipal governance to lead PHC reform through integrated, preventive, and community-based strategies. The findings provide valuable lessons for other cities in low- and middle-income countries seeking to enhance PHC resilience in fragile contexts. Strengthening digital capacity and ensuring institutional protection and funding for ESC will be key to sustaining progress. ANTECEDENTES: Este estudio tuvo como objetivo analizar y documentar c&#xf3;mo Quito, la capital de Ecuador, transform&#xf3; su modelo de Atenci&#xf3;n Primaria de Salud (APS) tras la pandemia de COVID-19. La reforma implic&#xf3; un cambio de un enfoque reactivo y hospitalario hacia un modelo basado en la comunidad, centrado en la prevenci&#xf3;n, los determinantes sociales de la salud y la participaci&#xf3;n local. M&#xe9;TODOS: Se utiliz&#xf3; un dise&#xf1;o cualitativo de estudio de caso, con un enfoque comparativo y deductivo, que incluy&#xf3; 11 entrevistas semiestructuradas con profesionales de la salud, tomadores de decisi&#xf3;n y personal administrativo. Adem&#xe1;s, se revisaron fuentes secundarias, como marcos legales nacionales y municipales (incluyendo el C&#xf3;digo Org&#xe1;nico y el Estatuto Org&#xe1;nico municipal), ordenanzas, el C&#xf3;digo Municipal y documentos de gobernanza e informes de rendici&#xf3;n de cuentas de tres administraciones municipales. El an&#xe1;lisis tem&#xe1;tico identific&#xf3; factores facilitadores clave y compar&#xf3; la experiencia de Quito con la de otras ciudades en Ecuador y Am&#xe9;rica Latina.

Estos equipos se enfocaron en la promoci&#xf3;n de la salud, la prevenci&#xf3;n de enfermedades y la coordinaci&#xf3;n intersectorial. Un motor clave de la reforma fue la negociaci&#xf3;n pol&#xed;tica para mantener el presupuesto en salud incrementado m&#xe1;s all&#xe1; de la pandemia, lo que permiti&#xf3; la operaci&#xf3;n sostenida de los ESC. Garantizar la seguridad f&#xed;sica del personal de salud tambi&#xe9;n se convirti&#xf3; en un componente esencial del modelo, apoyado por mapas de riesgo, sistemas de comunicaci&#xf3;n de emergencia y coordinaci&#xf3;n con actores locales de seguridad. El modelo fue institucionalizado mediante marcos legales y su alineaci&#xf3;n con iniciativas nacionales como el Programa de Municipios Saludables y el Modelo de Atenci&#xf3;n Integral de Salud Familiar, Comunitario e Intercultural (MAIS-FCI). Un motor clave de la reforma fue la negociaci&#xf3;n pol&#xed;tica para mantener el presupuesto en salud incrementado m&#xe1;s all&#xe1; de la pandemia, lo que permiti&#xf3; la operaci&#xf3;n sostenida de los ESC. Garantizar la seguridad f&#xed;sica del personal de salud tambi&#xe9;n se convirti&#xf3; en un componente esencial del modelo, apoyado por mapas de riesgo, sistemas de comunicaci&#xf3;n de emergencia y coordinaci&#xf3;n con actores locales de seguridad. La experiencia de Quito demuestra el potencial de la gobernanza municipal descentralizada para liderar reformas de APS mediante estrategias integradas, preventivas y basadas en la comunidad. Los hallazgos ofrecen lecciones valiosas para otras ciudades de pa&#xed;ses de ingresos bajos y medianos que buscan fortalecer la resiliencia de sus sistemas de APS en contextos fr&#xe1;giles. Fortalecer la capacidad digital y asegurar la protecci&#xf3;n institucional y el financiamiento de los ESC ser&#xe1; clave para mantener los avances logrados.",

    "abstract": "Health technology assessment (HTA) is a critical tool for evidence-based decision-making in healthcare systems, yet its implementation in low- and middle-income countries such as Iran remains understudied. This study examines the political dynamics of HTA implementation in Iran, focussing on the roles, interests and interactions of key stakeholders. By addressing the gap in understanding the political challenges and opportunities associated with HTA implementation, this study aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners. A qualitative study design was employed, using in-depth semi-structured interviews with 19 stakeholders from 6 categories: interest groups, political leaders, donors, financial decision-makers, beneficiaries and bureaucracies. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure representation across sectors. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, guided by the political analysis framework of Campos and Reich. The study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist to ensure methodological rigour. The findings reveal significant barriers to HTA implementation in Iran, including limited political will, competing priorities, inter-agency coordination challenges and concerns about equity and access. Interest groups, such as physicians and pharmacists, expressed concerns about restricted clinical autonomy and limited access to innovative treatments. Political leaders emphasized the difficulty of prioritizing HTA amidst competing healthcare and economic issues, whilst donors highlighted the need for alignment with national priorities and long-term sustainability. Financial decision-makers acknowledged the potential of HTA to improve resource allocation but raised concerns about budgetary constraints. Beneficiaries stressed the importance of transparency and inclusion, and bureaucrats underscored the need for stronger leadership and capacity building. The study underscores the importance of strong political leadership, stakeholder engagement and institutional capacity building for successful HTA implementation in Iran. Practical steps include strengthening inter-agency coordination mechanisms, ensuring transparent and inclusive decision-making processes, aligning donor support with national health priorities and investing in training programs to build technical capacity within government agencies. By addressing these challenges, policymakers can enhance the integration of HTA into the health system, ensuring efficient and equitable resource allocation.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination is a delay in an intended course of action and, thus, a self-regulation failure hindering growth and well-being. Contrarily, self-regulation is a set of cognitive and metacognitive skills and strategies supporting goal-directed behavior. There is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which (and the ways in which) promoting self-regulation may counteract procrastination. On the one hand, it is argued that procrastination is linked with stable personal dispositions; on the other hand, it is said that this problematic behavior is associated with contextual influences. To deepen the understanding of these relationships, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a theory-driven model integrating four self-regulation factors (goal setting, decision making, persevering, and learning from mistakes) and two measures of procrastination (irrational and academic). We hypothesized that goal setting, decision making, and perseverance would sequentially mediate between learning from mistakes and procrastination outcomes, thus, suggesting that cognitive-motivational (learning from mistakes, goal setting), strategic (decision making), and volitional (perseverance) factors may all be necessary for successful self-regulation, which could potentially be promoted by contextual influences. Participants of the present study were 433 Chilean university students (304 women, 129 men, M = 20.74 years, SD = 2.86) who completed measures for procrastination and self-regulation. Findings support the important roles of goal setting and perseverance for successful self-regulation and suggest that goal setting may mediate the effects of learning from mistakes on perseverance and decision making; whereas perseverance may mediate the effects of goal setting and decision making on procrastination variations. These results suggest that the negative effects of motivational and strategic factors of self-regulation on procrastination may depend at least partly on the abilities to improve goals and persevere. Taking into account these critical roles in dealing with procrastination, it seems appropriate to support college students' self-regulation skills and strategies, raising awareness about the indispensability of adequate goal setting and persistence in following through with intended courses of action.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination is common in the collegiate sphere. However, procrastination is often stigmatized as causing college students to be unsuccessful. Most students have been told not to procrastinate, but they continue to do so, implying that student procrastination will not stop. Yet, significant discontinuities exist between emerging procrastination related research -- specifically the distinction between active and passive procrastination, the concept of temporal discounting, and the methods of project management, each of which conflict with the standard advice given to students. This article synthesizes research in the aforementioned areas in order to create a more nuanced view of student procrastination and to establish better mechanisms to encourage student productivity.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination is a well-known phenomenon experienced by a lot of people in everyday life. People sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally put off their tasks even though they might be worse off due to the delay (e.g., not paying bills due, even though they have sufficient funds in their bank account). It is safe to say everybody procrastinates at some point, but in academia the rate is relatively higher. This dissertation is an exploratory study of the relationship and differences between self-reported academic procrastination and observed procrastination in relation to students' achievement goal orientations and self-regulated learning. A time-management/productivity mobile application (Proccoli) was developed and used to examine how students plan their studies toward their academic goals and whether they stick to their original plans (e.g., planned vs actual time they started working on a goal), change of study pattern and frequency when getting close to deadlines, and self-monitoring patterns across different academic procrastination levels. The main purpose of this dissertation is to bring a new perspective to academic procrastination studies particularly measuring and detecting procrastination utilizing mobile technology. The results revealed that students' perceptions and self-reports about their own procrastinatory behaviors do not match well with their actual studying behavior toward accomplishing their academic goals. Procrastinators are underestimating their actual procrastination behavior. Furthermore, higher level procrastinators are more likely to check their progress toward accomplishing their academic goals. The results, also, revealed meaningful relationships between how students carried out their initial plan on an academic goal and their achievement goal orientations.

    "abstract": "Introduction: A common impediment to any student's academic achievement and well being is the phenomenon of procrastination. Procrastination has typically been defined as a trait or behavioural disposition to postpone or delay performing a task or making decision. It is voluntary yet irrational delay of an intended course of action and frequently results in unsatisfactory, performance and emotional upset. Whereas, active procrastination is one's intentional decision to procrastinate in order to cope and focus attention on other tasks at hand and to experience performance pressure. Method: This study attempted to explore pre-University college (PUC) students' active procrastination in relation to their self-regulated learning. 120 PUC students were selected from four different schools of Gulbarga town in Karnataka state of India through multistage random sampling. With the demographic details of students, they were administered Active procrastination scale and Self-regulated learning measure. Results: Students of educated parents and boys have higher active procrastination. Urban and rural students do not differ in their active procrastination. Goal setting and planning, seeking information, keeping records and rehearsing and memorizing strategies are significantly related to active procrastination. Discussion and Conclusion: Urban students have higher organizing and transforming, rehearsing and memorizing and seeking social assistance SRL strategies. Students who engage in more than one hobby have better goal setting and planning, information seeking and total SRL. Active procrastination has significant relation with goal setting and planning, seeking information, keeping records, rehearsing and memorizing SRL strategies.",

    "abstract": "Effective time management, encompassing prioritization, overcoming procrastination, and balancing socialization, is crucial for academic success as it enables students to optimize their productivity, focus on important tasks, and maintain a healthy work-life balance, leading to improved academic achievements. Thus, the present study tried to investigate the relationship between time management in terms of prioritization, procrastination, and socialization and academic achievement. Using validated, reliable and standardized questionnaire, the researchers surveyed 213 education students using simple random technique. The study utilized quantitative approach, non-experimental, descriptive-correlational techniques. The study used mean, standard deviation and correlational analysis to analyzed the data. Based on the findings, the overall level of time management is moderate. The level of academic achievement is very good. In the test of correlation, the finding revealed that time management shows insignificant association with academic achievement. Thus, the finding suggests that the effectiveness of time management techniques in terms of the ability to prioritize tasks, the tendency to procrastinate, and the level of socialization may not be strong predictors of academic success in this specific setting or population under in this present investigation.",

This study analyzed the relationship, procrastination level, and the work productivity of academic staff from a tertiary education institution in Central Luzon, Philippines. Using a convenience sampling technique, 70 academic staff took part in the survey. This study used a descriptive-correlational design with an adapted questionnaire from McCloskey (2011) and Buuri (2015) as an instrument. For the statistical analysis, the study used SPSS 23 to analyze the gathered data. The study found that the academic staff &quot;often&quot; subject themselves to procrastination, and they &quot;agree&quot; that they are productive in their work. There were significant differences found in the procrastination level and work productivity of the academic staff when grouped according to sex, civil status, and years in service. In terms of relationship, the study confirmed a low direct relationship between the level of procrastination and work productivity of the academic staff. Based on the aforementioned results, the researcher provided some implications for the institution to consider.",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of this study was to investigate whether college students' academic time management could be used to understand their engagement in traditional and active forms of procrastination within a model of self-regulated learning. College students (N = 446) completed a self-report survey that assessed motivational and strategic aspects of self-regulated learning, time management, and procrastination. Results of regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy and metacognitive strategies initially were significant predictors of traditional and active forms of procrastination. Incorporating time management in the analyses increased the amount of the variance explained and, even in the presence of the motivation and strategy variables, time management emerged as an important predictor of both traditional and active forms of procrastination. Findings support the conclusion that academic time management is a key aspect of self-regulated learning and, as such, it can be useful for understanding the extent to which college students procrastinate when doing their academic work.",

Participants completed the Achievement Goal Questionnaire and the Tuckman Procrastination Test. Approach dimensions of both the mastery and performance goal orientations were found to be positively correlated with procrastination, but the avoidance dimensions of the mastery and performance goal orientations were not associated with procrastination. In regression analyses, mastery approach was the strongest predictor of procrastination, suppressing the effect of performance approach. The results suggest that the Western values underlying the achievement goals portrayed by the goal achievement model may not accurately reflect the motivations that are intrinsic to non-Western individuals. Further research is required to either validate such a tool in non-Western cultures or, alternatively, investigate alternative factors that may potentially influence procrastination within this demographic.",

Additionally, the classroom environment and self-regulatory traits may have joint effects on academic procrastination, but this question has not been adequately researched. Addressing these gaps, the present study examines how classroom goal structures and students' grit predict procrastination in mathematics learning, utilizing a sample of 915 primary school students in China. The findings reveal that grit mediates the relationship between classroom goal structures and procrastination. Specifically, classroom mastery goal structure was positively related to grit and further negatively predicted procrastination tendencies. The results also highlight the maladaptive role of performance goal structure, as it was negatively linked with students' consistency of interest and predicted a higher risk of mathematics procrastination. The results extend our understanding of the underlying relationships between classroom climate, self-regulatory traits, and procrastination. The potential reasons for and implications of the findings are discussed.",

Results of &quot;t&quot;-test showed significant differences between male and female students in terms of academic procrastination, organizing, and fear of failure. Male students compared to females scored higher in academic procrastination. Females students compared to males scored higher in fear of failure and organizing. Findings of Pearson correlations showed a positive association between fear of failure and academic procrastination, and a negative association between subscales of self-regulation and academic procrastination. Also, linear regression analyses showed that fear of failure and responsibility predict academic procrastination. As a conclusion, in order to reduce procrastination, some interventions can be delivered by handling in students' fear of failure and self-regulation.",

In the fifth condition, each participant was given the choice to work in either the high or low goal condition. Greater performance increases were reliably observed during the high goal condition than during the low goal condition, but patterns of persistence or deterioration varied across participants.

Two surveys, academic procrastination and time management, were given to 332 undergraduate students in this correlational research. Students' academic procrastination is explained through frequencies and percentages and a correlation is questioned between academic procrastination and time management. Regression analysis is used to find out if time management predicts academic procrastination in a statistically significant way. Besides, students' level of time management (low, medium, high) is examined and covariance analysis has been carried out to see if time management level and gender, time management level and housing type (private or state dormitory or house), time management level and their major and time management level and where they live have a common effect on academic procrastination. Results indicate that students are generally indecisive about their behaviors of procrastination in academic tasks and are in middle level in terms of time management skills. There is a moderate level, negative sided and statistically significant correlation between academic procrastination and time management. Not a common effect of mentioned above variables is seen.",

    "abstract": "Students spend little time completing tasks when deadlines are far off; however, they tend to increase their work amounts as deadline approaches. This phenomenon, which is called deadline rush, can be modeled by exponential distributions. Deadline reactivity, represented by a rate parameter of the exponential distribution, parameterizes individual differences in procrastination. That is, an individual with high reactivity to deadlines procrastinates more than an individual with low deadline reactivity. While the phenomenon and parametric models of individual differences in procrastination have been investigated, practical applications in the classroom setting have garnered little attention from researchers. Past research on procrastination has not much considered its relationships with learning environment factors and academic performance, with a lack of objective measurements and heavy reliance on self-reported questionnaires. My dissertation will respond to this gap in the research by modeling students' individual procrastination in university classroom settings, paying close attention to factors influencing the students' procrastination as well as the effects of procrastination on performance. In particular, the dissertation will answer the following three research questions: (1) Do learning environments (i.e., online learning, task complexity, and time in the academic term) affect students' procrastination? (2) Does procrastination affect individual and team performance? and (3) How can procrastination be predicted through physiological responses (i.e., eye movement, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature)? The first two research questions have been answered by longitudinal field studies, while controlled laboratory experiments are conducted to answer the third research question. My findings shed light on how objective modeling and prediction of procrastination can be applied in the classroom setting. In particular, the findings will provide instructors, researchers, and online learning platforms with practical strategies to better design classes and interventions of procrastination for improvements in students' performance.

    "abstract": "Effective time management often undergirds students' success in college, and many postsecondary learning centers offer services to help students assess and improve this aspect of their learning skills. In the context of a college success course, we gathered insights from assignments to consider various facets of students' time-related behaviors and attitudes. Specifically, we examined a range of indicators of time management (i.e., setting goals and priorities, mechanics of time management, preference for organization, and procrastination) and use (i.e., total hours tracked in various categories, patterns of time use during a seven-day period). Implications for practice derive from the tendencies for the group of enrolled students as a whole as well as the differences between students who were and were not on academic probation.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: The hypothesis that study strategies can compensate for less study time in predicting learning outcomes has often been proposed but rarely tested empirically. Methods: In the present study, 231 university students reported their daily perceived time spent on self-study, study strategies (planning, monitoring, concentration and procrastination) and goal achievement over a 30 days period. Results and Conclusion: Results showed that both more overall perceived study time and better study strategies (better planning, monitoring, and concentration, less procrastination) predicted higher goal achievement at the end of the day. In addition, perceived study time and study strategies interactively predicted goal achievement. When students reported better planning, monitoring and concentration as well as lower procrastination, less time was needed to achieve a high goal level compared to days on which they studied less strategically. In other words, when students studied less strategically, they had to invest more time to reach a higher goal level. In addition, perceived study time and study strategies were related to students' negative affect. Negative affect was particularly high when students studied for many hours with low concentration, and it was particularly low when students studied for only a few hours and procrastinated less. Taken together, the results suggest a compensatory effect of study time and study strategies on daily goal achievement and affect, highlighting the need to teach students effective study strategies.",

There are prevailing questions regarding the underlying and maintaining mechanisms of procrastination which are yet to be learnt. The aim of the present study was to combine different ways to explain procrastination and explore how students' time and effort management skills, psychological flexibility and academic self-efficacy are connected to procrastination as they have been commonly addressed separately in previous studies. The data were collected from 135 students who participated in a voluntary time management and well-being course in autumn 2019. The results showed that students' ability to organize their time and effort has the strongest association with procrastination out of the variables included in the study. Psychological flexibility also has a strong individual role in explaining procrastination along with time and effort management skills. Surprisingly, academic self-efficacy did not have a direct association with procrastination. Interestingly, our findings further suggest that time and effort management and psychological flexibility are closely related and appear to go hand in hand and, thus, both need to be considered when the aim is to reduce procrastination. The implications of the findings are further discussed.",

The basic goal of this study is to examine the relation between academic procrastination of the Psychological Counseling and Guidance students and achievement goal and their self-esteem. Besides this basis, another purpose of this study is to find out whether a difference occurs in academic procrastination of the Psychological Counseling and Guidance Departments students when their class level, gender, and success are taken into consideration. Survey method was used in the study as a data collection tool. The participants in this study were 426 students who were attending to Psychological Counseling Department. The data were also collected using the Academic Procrastination Scale, 2x2 Goal Orientations Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Information Form prepared by the researcher. The findings showed that there was a significant relation between academic procrastination of the Psychological Counseling and Guidance students and their self-esteem. According to the results a medium-level, negative and significant correlation was also found between academic procrastination behaviour of the Psychological Counseling and Guidance students and their learning approach.",

We randomly assigned 96 students to a treatment (n?=?47) and a control group (n?=?49). As hypothesised, participants of the control group showed procrastination: they spent more time on a self-selected, important academic task right before the deadline was reached compared to the weeks before. The participants of the treatment group, instead, allocated their work time more equally and did not show procrastination. Therefore, the explored time management intervention prevents from a serious time management problem.",

Findings of regression analyses indicated that parental expectations and criticism were the key predictors of students' adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism. Students' perceptions of classroom structure also positively predicted their adaptive perfectionism. Moreover, results of hierarchical regressions suggested that perceived classroom structure, parental expectations and criticism, as well as adaptive perfectionism all emerged as predictors of time management. With regard to procrastination on homework and examination preparation, parental expectations and adaptive perfectionism were negative predictors, whereas parental criticism and maladaptive perfectionism were positive predictors. Also, time management negatively predicted academic procrastination.",

However, the effect of academic procrastination on assignments in distance learning setting has not been analyzed extensively. To understand the interaction between academic procrastination and the learning environment; assignment and exam performances of eighty-eight university students in face-to-face (FtF) and distance learning (DL) environments were investigated. According to the findings of the study, students' academic procrastination and assignment scores were negatively correlated in both environments but especially in DL setting. Contrary to this, academic procrastination and exam scores were correlated to each other only in FtF environment. On the other hand, there was no correlation between total assignment and exam scores for DL group, while a medium positive correlation was found in FtF group. The findings of binary logical regression analysis demonstrated that predictive value of the DL environment for assignment score is much stronger than academic procrastination behavior of students.",

Specifically, we assumed that self-regulation in terms of time management, procrastination, effort regulation, and time for independent studies might be affected. Analyses based on structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that motivation significantly positively predicted time management and effort regulation and that procrastination negatively predicted time management and effort regulation. Students' perceived stress increased both procrastination and independent study time, whereas remote teaching only weakly reduced procrastination. Students' physical working conditions slightly affected time management. An important finding of the study is the minor impact of students' attendance of remote classes on self-regulation.",

Hensley selected the methodology (phenomenology) in order to undertake an in-depth study of active procrastination via the experiences and reflections of a small group of participants with first-hand knowledge of the phenomenon. Findings revealed three major themes about active procrastination: (1) Purposeful delay facilitated greater efficiency (I'm good at it); (2) was done systematically (I've learned I can); and (3) was reinforced by appealing academic and social outcomes (It's worth it). Findings also revealed several reasons for students' commitment to procrastination that included active procrastinators ability to complete assignments efficiently, attain acceptable grades, and advance social connections. Drawbacks identified included terms of stress, surface-level learning, and feelings of regret and guilt. Acknowledging the delicate balance between procrastination's draws and drawbacks, implications for practice relate to both educational environments and support for self-directed change.",

The goal of the present study was to examine the relation between student research procrastination and two important data quality issues--careless responding and measurement noninvariance. Data gathered from university students across two semesters tentatively indicated that procrastination is related to low-quality survey data. Procrastination was slightly more problematic for certain data quality issues (measurement noninvariance) than others (careless responding). These relations, however, were small and contingent on how procrastination and careless responding were measured. Accordingly, it seems more beneficial for researchers to select a sampling window that supports their research goals and statistical power requirements rather than select a sampling window that attempts to minimize careless survey responding or other measurement issues.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Previous studies indicated that more than 70% university students committed academic procrastination, and one of the most prominent factors is learned helplessness, the perception that one is incapable of finishing tasks well. It was also hypothesized that when students believe that they are in control of their own events, their learned helplessness will not significantly predict their academic procrastination. This current study aims to test the hypothesis whether internal locus of control mediates the relationship between learned helplessness and academic procrastination among university students. Method: A total of 240 university students were randomly recruited to participate in this current study. Duttweiller's Internal Control Scale was utilized to measure the internal locus of control, Pure Procrastination Scale (adapted for academic setting) was employed to measure the academic procrastination level and Learned Helplessness Scale was used to measure the level of learned helplessness among the participants. Multiple regression with PROCESS macros was employed to analyze the data. Results: Results indicated that learned helplessness significantly predicted internal locus of control, and that internal locus of control was a significant predictor of academic procrastination. These results support the mediational hypothesis. Learned helplessness was no longer a significant predictor of academic procrastination after controlling for the internal locus of control, consistent with full mediation. Approximately 21% of the variance in academic procrastination can be explained by the predictors. Indirect coefficient was significant. Learned helplessness was associated with approximately 0.15 points higher academic procrastination scores as mediated by internal locus of control. Discussion and Conclusion: Internal locus of control fully mediates the influence of learned helplessness on academic procrastination. In other words, when students believe that they are in control of their events, the less likely they will procrastinate doing their tasks due to helplessness they have learned. Findings of this study suggested that procrastination in academic setting occurred due to the perception of helplessness that have been learned over time; nevertheless, the influence will not be that deteriorating towards the students when they believe that they are responsible and in control of their events.",

The relationships between procrastination, disorganisation, the forethought phase of self-regulated learning (SRL), academic performance and self-regulation failure are addressed. Self-report scales were used to assess procrastination, disorganisation, and forethought. Three hypotheses about the relationships between these dimensions were tested. The first is that disorganisation and procrastination are two distinct constructs; it is argued that they represent two routes via which self-regulation failure can be manifested. The second is that disorganisation and procrastination have a negative impact on academic performance; the results obtained showed that only disorganisation had a negative impact on academic performance. The third is that the implementation of high-quality processes during the forethought phase is a safeguard against disorganisation and procrastination.",

    "abstract": "Academic procrastination generates several problems and negative consequences both individually and collectively: low student performance, increased stress, negative effects on physical and mental health, and general waste of resources. Therefore, it demands to be studied and understood in its different forms, so that mitigating mechanisms can be developed. The current work seeks to analyse the phenomenon of academic procrastination within postgraduate students registered for the Management Postgraduate Program in a Brazilian Federal University, in order to identify strategies, techniques and tools utilised by the students to overcome procrastination as well as its relation with the concepts of self-regulation and self-efficacy. The current research is descriptive with a qualitative nature, adopting a phenomenological approach through thematic analysis in order to bring to light the experiences and perceptions of individuals from their own perspectives, challenging structural or normative assumptions. In total, 24 students, 12 from the master's degree program and 12 from the doctorate program in Management were interviewed. As a result, it was noticed that there are some overall inferences that can be taken from the narratives, outlining the phenomenon of academic procrastination and its relations with the concepts of self-regulation and self-efficacy, which led to reinforce the notion that the central elements to understand and specifically combat procrastination are related to the concepts of self-efficacy and self-regulation, which have a considerable influence on students' motivation, behaviour and habits. The research has also pointed to some key strategies, techniques and tools that can be utilised to support further applied research as well as to guide the faculty in supporting the students to overcome or mitigate the procrastination impulse, such as use of goal orientation, visual tools, and academic support starting with undergraduate degrees. The work has an original contribution as no research has been made on that topic utilising qualitative data through a phenomenological approach, which opens a vast and new path for future research.",

A mediational framework was utilized to examine the associations among procrastination, EFs, and four ADHD symptoms domains. Results: Results indicated that both procrastination and GPA correlated with EFs and three ADHD symptom domains. While EFs mediated the association between procrastination and ADHD symptoms, follow-up analyses suggested that self-management of time and organization/problem-solving are the specific pathways through which procrastination is indirectly associated with ADHD symptoms.

The general tendency toward delaying academic tasks has been conceptualized as academic procrastination in academic setting. It is a prevalent issue among students and a numerous students have to deal with it at almost all stage of education, because of its negative consequences such as academic failure and poorer well-being. The current study examined the gender differences in relation to academic procrastination, academic performance and academic life satisfaction. Method: The participants for this study were 441 undergraduate students (49.4% of female and 50.6% of male). Aitken procrastination inventory, Academic satisfaction scale and Demographic information form were used to gather data. Results: The results noticed that academic procrastination was negatively related with academic performance and academic life satisfaction. Male students had higher level academic procrastination and lower level of academic performance and academic life satisfaction. The MANOVA and Hierarchical Regression analyses displayed that gender moderated the relationship between academic procrastination, academic performance and academic life satisfaction. Discussion and Conclusion: The current study suggests that male students are more vulnerable to destructive effect of academic procrastination in terms of academic performance and academic life satisfaction.",

A sample of Chinese adolescents from a high school in Changsha City, HuNan Province, China participated in this study. The participants completed the Aitken Procrastination Inventory and the Test Anxiety Scale at two times during a semester. Pearson correlation analysis showed academic procrastination and test anxiety to be positively correlated. Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated that academic procrastination at Time 1 predicted test anxiety at Time 2, while test anxiety at Time 1 did not predict academic procrastination at Time 2. Within the limits of the design, we found that academic procrastination may lead to an increase in test anxiety, but test anxiety did not predict the future level of academic procrastination. It is recognised that the relationship between anxiety and procrastination is complicated. It is suggested that a focus on interventions for academic procrastination may help to reduce students' test anxiety, but not necessarily vice versa.",

Through qualitative interviews with participants, the authors conducted thematic analysis on their experiences. Three overarching themes emerged: perception, reasons, and reflection of academic procrastination among distance learners. Notably, participants frequently procrastinated, primarily due to study-life balance challenges. Surprisingly, participants expressed overall satisfaction with their academic performance despite procrastination tendencies. They considered procrastination a conscious choice, prioritizing other life commitments over studying. This study sheds light on the influence of external factors on procrastination behavior in distance learning. The findings suggest that academic procrastination is prevalent among distance learning students, with study-life balance being a significant predictor. Participants' satisfaction with their academic performance suggests that procrastination may be a deliberate choice. This research highlights the need for tailored interventions to address procrastination in distance education settings.",

The results of an online survey among 259 first-year humanities and social sciences students revealed that 42.4% of the variance in procrastination was predicted by effort regulation and study time management, and 4% by psychological inflexibility. There was also a negative relationship between academic performance and procrastination.

Although past findings have shown that procrastination negatively relates to academic achievement, no study has examined the influence of procrastination on the grade trajectory of students during this critical academic transition. Therefore, our main goal was to use a prospective design to examine the potentially detrimental role of procrastination on the grade trajectory from high school to the first year at university. We also examined the influence of procrastination over and above five demographic and socio-economic control variables. A sample of 269 first-year university students completed a procrastination questionnaire during their first semester at university. The official grades at three time points were obtained via the Registrar's Office: (1) the average grade of the last year of high school; (2) the average grade of the first semester at university; and (3) the average grade of the second semester at university. Results of piecewise multilevel growth modeling revealed that higher procrastination was associated with a larger grade decrease from high school to the first semester at university, which was maintained during the second semester at university even after considering demographic and socio-economic control variables. This study underscores that procrastination is a risk factor that tends to exacerbate the achievement difficulties experienced by students during the transition from high school to university.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination, putting off until tomorrow what should have been done today, is a self-regulation failure that is widespread among students. Although plenty of research has emerged regarding academic procrastination, hardly any research endeavor regarding procrastination in distance university settings exists. This lack of research is even more astonishing when considering that the demands on self-regulation are higher in distance education settings than in traditional university settings. The present (questionnaire) study was intended to shed light on procrastination in an actual distance university setting by exploring its relationship to grades, learning strategies (e.g., cognitive, meta-cognitive strategies), and life satisfaction in students from a distance university in comparison to students from a traditional university.

    "abstract": "Time management is crucial to success in online courses in which students can schedule their learning on a flexible basis. Procrastination is largely viewed as a failure of time management and has been linked to poorer outcomes for students. Past research has quantified the extent of students' procrastination by defining single measures directly from raw logs of student activity. In this work, we use a probabilistic mixture model to allow different types of behavioral patterns to naturally emerge from clickstream data and analyze the resulting patterns in the context of procrastination. Moreover, we extend our analysis to include measures of student regularity--how consistent the procrastinating behaviors are--and construct a composite Time Management Score (&quot;TM&quot;). Our results show that mixture modeling is able to unveil latent types of behavior, each of which is associated with a level of procrastination and its regularity. Overall, students identified as non-procrastinators tend to perform significantly better. Within non-procrastinators, higher levels of regularity signify better performance, while this may be the opposite for procrastinators. [For the full proceedings, see ED593090.]",

    "abstract": "Studies show that many students struggle with properly organizing their academic activities; what makes things even worse is that up to 90% of students are at least part-time procrastinators. In order to clarify how these students could be supported, the article at hand deals with the influences and possible benefits of implementation intentions in an academic learning context and substantiates the literature discussion with data collected among students. Aiming at studying the antecedents of academic performance from a cognitive perspective, the research complements an extended form of the Theory of Planned Behaviour by integrating procrastination and experience. Unlike many other studies, this paper does not focus on reasons for nor different forms of procrastination, but rather develops a comprehensive framework for understanding academic learning. A structural equation modelling approach is applied for this purpose using an empirical data base. For the outcome of this research different hypotheses are investigated especially in reference to implementation intentions. In the majority of cases the theories presented during the literature review can be substantiated with the empirical data used for the study. Key findings are the significant influences of goal intentions, as well as experience, and their positive effect on implementation intentions. Furthermore, the negative influence of procrastination is underlined by the results of the paper and identified as a major problem for college students. Other findings of the paper are the effects of subjective norms and PBC (Perceived Behaviour Control) on the formation of goal intentions. Nevertheless, the study brings up several further questions and identifies areas where research should be deepened, that is behaviour itself.",

There is evidence that students' future time perspective negatively affected students' academic procrastination. Although the relationship between future time perspective and academic procrastination is stable. There are research gaps to be filled. On the one hand, most attention was paid to older students such as undergraduates rather than primary students. On the other hand, we still know little about the mechanism of their relationship. This study aimed to explore the mediating role of students' positive emotion between their future time perspective and academic procrastination. A total of 185 (92are boys and 93 are girls) primary students completed measures self-report in the study. Correlational results showed that future time perspective positively correlated positive emotion, negatively associated with academic procrastination, and positive emotion negatively linked to academic procrastination. Bootstrapped mediation results showed positive emotion partially mediated the relationship between future time perspective and academic procrastination.

    "abstract": "In this mixed-method investigation, the researchers delved into the intricate dynamics underlying Chinese postgraduates' procrastination behavior, academic engagement, and self-confidence, unveiling a multifaceted interplay among these factors. Quantitative findings revealed an intermediate-high level of procrastination, particularly in relation to writing assignments, exam preparations, and weekly reading tasks, while attendance tasks and general school activities elicited lower procrastination levels. Further analysis elucidated a substantial negative correlation between procrastination behaviors and both academic engagement and self-confidence, indicating the pernicious influence of this pervasive phenomenon on students' academic experiences. Qualitative insights garnered through thematic analysis explicated the complex reasons behind procrastination, including being overwhelmed by intricate tasks, lack of genuine interest, competitive milieu, insecurities, distractions, cultural and familial pressures, and struggles with time management, prioritization, and perfectionism. Furthermore, inadequate mentorship and anxiety surrounding future career prospects emerged as significant contributors to procrastination. Evidently, this detrimental factor not only impeded postgraduates' academic immersion but also eroded their self-confidence, exacerbating the detrimental repercussions on their scholarly performance. Thus, the findings underscore the imperative for targeted interventions, encompassing mentorship, time management skills, and emotional support, to mitigate the deleterious effects of procrastination on Chinese postgraduates' academic engagement and self-confidence.",

The results of an online study on 249 first-year humanities and social sciences French students showed that 30% of the variance in procrastination was predicted positively by avoidance goals and negatively by effort regulation management. The effort regulation management strategy alone contributed to 24% of the variance in procrastination. Furthermore, the results confirmed the negative relationship between academic performance and procrastination tendency. Added together, these results support the conceptualization of procrastination as a self-regulation failure and specially of learning such as effort regulation management.

Method: Basis for the research was a survey (N = 204) which investigated university students' (research participants) exam revision. In 2010, 1,149 German engineering students with an average age of 22.5 years received written questionnaires. 204 students were included in the overall evaluation. I used a structural equation modeling path analysis method to examine the possible relations between the above mentioned variables. Results: The results show that the determinant examination experience has a significant and substantial influence on implementation intention, whereas goal intention hasn't. This influence is also relevant with regard to the determination procrastination. Discussion: Based on the results, that examination experience influences students' exam revision more than expected by the &quot;Theory of Planned Behavior&quot; model. I concluded that more examination experience could be an opportunity to reduce the intention-behavior-gap. Furthermore, it could be stated that the development of implementation intention is promoted by goal intention and examination experience. A unilateral focus on goal intention is not reasonable. Examination experience can have a positive impact on procrastination behavior. In addition, it could be stated, that a lack or lower level of methodological skills or examination experience can be decisive for study success. With regard to the determination action control no influence was detected.",

Studies reported that more than 70% university students procrastinate, and one of the causes is the perception that one is vulnerable or helpless in finishing the procrastinate tasks. It was hypothesized that internal locus of control iLOC can reduce the effect if the learned helplessness (LH) on academic procrastination. Data was collected from 60 university students by utilizing instruments such as Duttweiller's Internal Control Scale, Pure Procrastination Scale (adapted for academic setting) and Learned Helplessness Scale. Multiple regression with Process add-on showed that full mediation occurred; the prediction of LH on procrastination became insignificant when iLOC is controlled. In other words, when students believe that they are in control of their events, the less likely they will procrastinate doing their tasks due to helpless feeling.",

Our objective is to quantify the household-level direct and indirect health and economic impact of measles outbreaks caused by reduction in MMR vaccine uptake. A network-based SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) model is used to simulate the transmission of measles over a synthetic social contact network of Virginia, under various scenarios. Household-level costs of measles outbreak, encompassing MMR vaccine expenses, treatment costs, and productivity losses, are estimated from the simulation results. A Generalized Spatial Autoregressive (GSAR) model is used to estimate the spatial 'spillover effect' on neighboring counties. Our findings indicate that reduced MMR vaccination rates are associated with increased measles cases and related economic costs, which are intensified by disease transmissibility and moderated by home quarantine. The GSAR model, with spatial lag coefficients, shows significant spatial interdependencies. A small decrease in vaccination rate in an urban region like Richmond, Virginia, has significant economic and epidemiological spillover effect, while similar reductions in rural regions like Highland County, Virginia, have a negligible impact. A decline in MMR vaccination rate has ramifications for both disease incidence and the economy, presenting diverse consequences influenced by regional disparities. Policymakers should acknowledge the interconnectedness of health and economic outcomes across regions. This research underscores the necessity of implementing broad, region-wide policy measures in response to fluctuations in vaccination rates, prioritizing overarching strategies over localized interventions.",

    "abstract": "Developments in image captioning technologies played a crucial role in improving the quality of life for individuals with visual impairments, advancing better social inclusivity. Image captioning is the task of representing the visual content of the images in natural language, applying a language method and a visual understanding system able to generate significant and syntactically correct sentences. Image captioning is a field of research of vast significance, targeting the creation of natural language representations for visual content in static images. Automatically representing the image content is a significant challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the emergence of deep learning (DL) and the most recent vision-language pre-training methods have significantly advanced the domain, resulting in more advanced techniques and enhanced performance. DL-based methods can process the difficulties and nuances of image captioning. This paper proposes an Innovative Multi-Head Attention Mechanism-Driven Recurrent Neural Network with Feature Representation Fusion for Image Captioning Performance (MARNN-FRFICP) approach to assist individuals with visual impairments. The MARNN-FRFICP approach aims to enhance image captioning by employing an effective method focused on improving accessibility for individuals with visual impairments. Initially, the Gaussian filtering (GF) technique is utilized in the image pre-processing stage to enhance image quality by removing the noise. In addition, the fusion of advanced DL models, namely InceptionResNetV2, convolutional vision transformer (CvT), and DenseNetl69, is employed to enhance the effectiveness of the feature extraction process. Moreover, the hybrid of multi-head attention mechanism-based bi-directional long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit (MH-BLG) technique is used for classification. Finally, the Lyrebird optimization algorithm (LOA) technique is employed for tuning. The efficiency of the MARNN-FRFICP methodology is examined under the Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO datasets. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the MARNN-FRFICP methodology has improved scalability and performance compared to recent techniques in various measures.",

    "abstract": "The growing global demand for sustainable and nutritious food sources has spurred interest in alternative proteins, including those from insects. Cricket (CK) protein, in particular, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its high nutritional value and relatively environmentally friendly production. This study investigates the potential of CK protein and its derived peptides as functional food ingredients. We focus on the effects of CK protein consumption and the specific impacts of peptides generated through enzymatic hydrolysis, a process that breaks down proteins into smaller molecules and bioactive peptides. Our results suggest that CK protein, which is hydrolyzed by pepsin enzymes in the body, may reduce lipid accumulation without significantly affecting bone formation. However, enzymatic hydrolysis using pepsin or Alcalase enzymes can yield peptides with distinct biological effects. Specifically, pepsin-derived peptides promote osteogenesis, while Alcalase-derived peptides enhance adipogenesis. Moreover, we found that Alcalase-peptides significantly induced brown fat formation in vitro. These results highlight the potential of cricket protein-derived peptides as functional food ingredients to modulate cellular differentiation and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Poland, with a population of 38&#xa0;million, lacks a comprehensive dataset on major fungal infections, leaving the country absent from international fungal burden maps. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of databases of published literature and national demographic and health data to estimate the incidence and prevalence of serious fungal infections in Poland, focusing on the general population and high-risk groups. The estimates indicate a substantial and heterogeneous burden of serious mycoses in Poland. The most common yeast infection is recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis, affecting 12,300-81,600 women annually, while invasive candidosis leads to 280-4600 cases of candidaemia, mostly in intensive care units. Cryptococcosis is very rare, with about 30 cases per year, and Pneumocystis pneumonia occurs in 53-959 patients annually. Invasive aspergillosis, with about 5000 estimated cases annually, is the most important mould infection, mainly affecting patients with respiratory disease and immunosuppression. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis adds about 3,200 cases each year. Mucormycosis is estimated at around 60 cases annually. Other mycoses, such as keratitis and subcutaneous forms, are reported only sporadically. These findings highlight that serious mycoses are a relevant but under-recognized health problem in Poland and underline the need for improved surveillance and targeted public health measures.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation is crucial in collaborative work environments such as manufacturing shop floors. This study investigates the application of indirect reciprocity-where individuals cooperate to build a positive reputation-in improving shop floor efficiency using a cost-benefit mechanism. The research explores a dynamic scenario where workers, possessing varied skill levels, engage in cooperative behaviours when encountering social dilemmas. Using real shop floor data as input to a simulation model, the study analyses how different cooperation strategies can affect key performance metrics, including worker skill scarcity duration, machine delay time, and benefit-cost ratio. Results indicate that full cooperation significantly enhances task allocation efficiency, reduces machine delays, and optimises resource utilisation, outperforming other strategies such as partial cooperation and defection, and full defection. The study provides evidence that cooperative strategies based on social incentives not only improve immediate task execution but also reveal the importance of a culture of accountability and mutual support among workers. These findings suggest the potential of integrating social cooperation principles into shop floor management systems to address skill demand challenges, to minimise operational delays, and to promote overall productivity.",

    "abstract": "The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing globally, with significant variations in disease levels and trends across different countries and regions. Currently, despite a wealth of research reporting data on adult and paediatric populations, there has been a lack of in-depth focus on the burden of CKD in adolescents and young adults (AYA). We aim to assess the global prevalence of CKD among AYA. We implemented a cross-sectional study. A systematic retrieval of data was conducted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, primarily using the most recent updated information from 2021. We used GBD data and methodologies to characterise the changes in CKD burden among AYA, including incidence rates, death rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Additionally, we employed decomposition analysis, frontier analysis and health inequality analysis to investigate the prevalence of CKD in countries or regions with varying levels of socioeconomic development. On a global scale, between 1990 and 2021, the number of AYA with CKD increased from 232025.4 (95% UI 153243.5-323838.5) in 1990 to 387070.1 (95% UI 287311.6-508428.3) in 2021. For AYA, the primary causes of CKD are other and unspecified causes (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, etc), followed by glomerulonephritis. Over the past 30 years, the decline in CKD burden among AYA has been most significant in countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Portugal, Russia, France and Italy. In contrast, the countries or regions with the fastest-growing CKD burden are Somalia, Mozambique, Chad, Uganda, Niger and Angola in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq and Pakistan in the Middle East or South Asia. Despite improvements over the decades, the burden of CKD among AYA remains concentrated in low-income countries and populations with poorer economic conditions. From 1990 to 2021, the death and DALYs burden of CKD among AYA globally remained relatively stable, but the incidence rate is steadily increasing. AYA in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and parts of South Asia tolerate the highest burden, particularly in countries with lower socioeconomic status. To prevent worsening inequalities associated with socioeconomic development, there is an emphasis on the importance of increasing investments in kidney health for AYA in low-income countries.",

    "abstract": "Traditional smoking is widely recognized as a public health issue, with established risks that include cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer-related health impacts. Recently, alternative tobacco and nicotine products (ATNPs), such as electronic cigarettes, have gained popularity as potentially safer substitutes for traditional tobacco use. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the health effects of ATNPs, which require comprehensive research to evaluate their risks and potential benefits compared to conventional smoking. The aim of this multicenter observational study, MINERVA (My Changing Lifestyles Our Research and Everyone Health), is to examine the interplay between traditional smoking and the potential effect of switching to ATNPs in culturally diverse European countries. Data collection will be conducted through a structured web-based questionnaire and administered using a snowball sampling technique, which relies on the referrals and network connections of initial participants. A link will be provided for participants to access the questionnaire. Responders who express a willingness to participate in the study cohort will be recontacted at least twice a year to ensure continuity in their participation, and they will be asked to complete the same questionnaire during these follow-up assessments. This approach allows for the gathering of useful information over an extended period and the assessment of any changes or trends in the data that may emerge over time. Using social media for data collection, the research explores real-time attitudes and experiences related to smoking, with a particular focus on participants' receptiveness to transitioning to nonconventional tobacco products. Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics, and logistic regression models will examine associations. Nonlinear trends will be assessed using restricted cubic splines. Analyses will be conducted in R software with relevant statistical packages. The MINERVA study began in June 2023, and data collection is still in progress. As of January 2025, 7535 participants had been enrolled in Italy, of whom 4862 have consented to a follow-up. Preliminary analyses are currently being conducted. The study underscores the importance of ongoing research to inform evidence-based policies and interventions, emphasizing the role of social media surveys in capturing diverse perspectives and facilitating longitudinal studies for a deeper understanding of the health implications of transitioning from traditional smoking to ATNPs.

    "abstract": "Birch bark tar was widely used throughout prehistoric Europe for hafting stone tools as well as various other purposes. While previous research has mainly focused on the identification and production of birch bark tar, its diverse uses remain to be fully explored. In this study, we combined ancient DNA with organic residue analysis to analyse 30 birch tar artefacts from nine Neolithic sites in and around the Alps. We identified birch tar as the main component, with some samples also containing conifer resin or tar, possibly added to modify its properties. Degradation markers indicate that tar used for ceramic repair was heated repeatedly, probably during cooking. Additionally, the presence of human and oral microbial DNA in some of the samples suggests the tar was chewed, in some cases by multiple individuals. The human DNA also enables us to determine the sex of those who chewed the tar, offering insights into gendered practices in the past, while plant and animal DNA shed light on past diets and the possible use of additives. This study underscores the value of integrating organic residue and ancient DNA analysis of archaeological artefacts to deepen our understanding of past cultural practices.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the proliferation of misinformation on social media, termed the \"infodemic,\" has complicated global health responses. This study aims to identify research trends and information-making in the context of this challenge. This paper synthesizes key areas of scholarly investigation into the COVID-19 infodemic, both within China and internationally, to guide public health strategies and the management of public sentiment. By employing a bibliometric approach, using CiteSpace software, we conducted a visual analysis of the global literature, covering a total of 1437 publications from the Web of Science and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure core databases between 2016 and 2025, focusing on publication trends, citation frequencies, and keyword clusters. After analysis, the results reveal distinct focal points in the research priorities of Chinese and international scholars. International studies often focus on machine learning and public psychology, while Chinese research tends to address information control and safeguarding. Common ground is found in the interest in preventing the spread of misinformation. While literature on COVID-19 abounds, cross-national systematic reviews are limited. This paper fills this gap through a comparative bibliometric analysis, offering valuable insights for information management, media communication, and public administration, thus charting new directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the stock market's response to the assassination of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, focusing on the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of publicly listed U.S. insurance firms. Using topic modeling on 59,644 Reddit comments, we identify and analyze key public narratives surrounding the incident, revealing nine topics including the themes of (1) public anger at the profit-driven practices of the insurance industry, (2) support for the shooter, criticism of the CEO, and (3) frustrations over healthcare costs and systemic inefficiencies. Sentiment analysis further shows that discussions are overwhelmingly negative, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction. Empirical analysis demonstrates that corporate characteristics such as profit, revenue growth, and media attention significantly amplify negative CARs, highlighting the market's sensitivity to perceptions of corporate profit and glamour. High executive compensation, particularly for CEOs, is also associated with more severe stock price declines, suggesting that leadership privileges intensify investor concerns. However, no evidence links CEO narcissism to negative stock impacts, indicating that public focus is more on systemic business practices than individual attitudes. Firms in the 'Hospital &amp; Medical Service Plans' segment, including UnitedHealthcare and its peers, experienced the steepest declines immediately after the incident, reflecting heightened public discontent with companies closely tied to essential healthcare services. These findings support the views of 'social banditry theory and investor sentiment' and contribute to the broader debate between 'shareholder vs. stakeholder value maximization', emphasizing the risks of overlooking societal expectations.",

    "abstract": "Conflict-induced migration is a key driver of global food insecurity. Over the past decade, prolonged conflicts have displaced millions of people. This crisis plunged millions into acute hunger, deepening existing vulnerabilities and severely restricting access to food and livelihoods across Yemen. This study aims to investigate the relationship between conflict-induced migration and food insecurity in Yemen, focusing on how displacement exacerbates hunger and malnutrition among affected populations. This study analyzed responses from 13,891 individuals across 22 governorates, using data from the Yemen Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2022-2023. The two primary indicators of food insecurity - specifically, hunger frequency and instances of not eating for a full day - were examined. Additionally, Negative Binomial Regression was employed to model the over-dispersed count data while controlling for factors such as sex, age, education, household size, urban-rural location, and wealth. The findings revealed that approximately 24% of respondents experienced hunger, while about 12% went without food for an entire day. Moreover, conflict-induced migration substantially augmented the incidence of hunger (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.262; 95% CI: 1.111-1.435) and going without eating for an entire day (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.251; 95% CI: 1.032-1.516), though international migration to Yemen decreased food insecurity. Additionally, being female, having higher education, and belonging to wealthier households were protective factors against food insecurity, while urban residence significantly increased the likelihood of hunger (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.231; 95% CI: 1.990-2.501) and meal skipping (IRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.657; 95% CI: 3.086-4.335). Conflict-induced displacement is associated with worsened food insecurity, escalating hunger, and deprivation among displaced people, underscoring the immediate necessity of targeted humanitarian interventions in Yemen. Policy measures must prioritize the re-establishment of food systems and livelihoods in affected regions to alleviate the intensifying hunger crisis.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating and incurable neurodegenerative disease with unsolved etiology. Due to the large proportion of patients lacking direct disease inheritance, understanding the environmental factors that contribute to ALS development is of high priority. Epidemiological studies have implicated pesticides and other environmental exposures as possible contributors to ALS pathogenesis. Recently, our group determined that the organochlorine pesticide cis-chlordane is toxic to human motor neurons in a dose-dependent manner, causing an ALS-like phenotype in culture and animals with a mode of action independent of its known GABAA antagonism. Here, we aimed to characterize downstream motor neuron phenotypes associated with cis-chlordane treatment. We performed bulk RNA sequencing, live imaging, immunofluorescent labeling, and real-time metabolic assays on stem cell-derived motor neurons to assess chlordane-associated phenotypes in vitro. We demonstrate that cis-chlordane treatment causes a highly altered mitochondrial phenotype in motor neurons, including increased production of reactive oxygen species, decreased oxygen consumption rate and ATP production, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. We further implicate cis-chlordane as a possible mediator of potent motor neuron damage, with exposure to the pesticide inducing mitochondrial phenotypes akin to those seen in ALS. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that future studies of investigating the role of pesticides in ALS development should focus on organochlorine molecules.",

Screening is a critical strategy for HIV and HCV control to reach the World Health Organization's elimination goals by 2030. This study assessed the outcomes of a healthcare quality improvement project integrating routine opportunistic BBV screening and linkage to care in emergency services for high-risk patients. This project aimed at providing HIV and HCV fast-track screening among patients seeking care in the emergency department of Hospital Cl&#xed;nic de Barcelona (Spain) and re-engage individuals previously diagnosed but not currently in care. This observational study included patients &#x2265;18 years old who presented to the emergency department reporting genitourinary complaints or recent high-risk exposures for HIV, HCV, or other sexually transmitted infections. Using the FOCUS TEST model as a framework, a systematic opportunistic HIV and HCV screening and offered linkage to care (LTC) to patients with positive test results was conducted. Screening was performed using fourth-generation chemiluminescence immunoassays for HIV and HCV antibodies, including p24 antigen detection, with confirmatory HCV RNA testing by PCR. The FOCUS TEST model supports automatic integration of testing into routine workflows and staff training. For each of these blood-borne viruses, the screening volume, testing uptake, seroprevalence, characteristics of patients with new infections, and LTC rates were analyzed. Between January 2020 and December 2022, 35,285 blood-borne virus tests were performed. The number of new infections detected was 38 for HIV (0.41% seroprevalence) and 34 for HCV (0.19% HCV RNA prevalence). LTC was achieved for 89% and 100% of patients diagnosed with new HIV and HCV infections, respectively. A separate set of patients with HIV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;297) or HCV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) infections identified prior to this screening program were re-linked to care via this project. This healthcare quality improvement project was feasible and successful in achieving its goal of providing systematic opportunistic HIV and HCV screening to patients seeking urgent care. Importantly, the program also enabled LTC of a considerable number of patients previously diagnosed but not retained in care, further strengthening its impact on public health. These outcomes align with global goals for the elimination of HIV and HCV as public health threats by 2030 and demonstrate that similar fast-track screening and linkage strategies could be effectively implemented in other urban emergency settings with appropriate infrastructure and support.",

    "abstract": "Knee dislocations are rare but severe injuries, often resulting from high-energy trauma and commonly associated with vascular and neurologic damage. In low-income settings, the evaluation and management of these injuries are especially challenging because of limited access to advanced imaging, surgical implants, and structured rehabilitation services. This review aims to provide a practical, evidence-based framework for managing knee dislocations in resource-constrained environments. A focused literature review was conducted on studies published in the past decade that address diagnosis, treatment strategies, and system-level barriers in underserved regions. Key topics include simplified diagnostic approaches using clinical evaluation and basic imaging, early detection of vascular and nerve injuries without advanced tools, and cost-effective surgical techniques. These include the use of autografts, external fixators, and implantless fixation methods such as press-fit and bone bridges, as well as the use of the same tunnels and fixation devices for more than one ligament. Rehabilitation strategies are also adapted, with emphasis on simplified protocols that consider social and logistical barriers to follow-up. Despite notable limitations, appropriate prioritization, creative use of available materials, and staged reconstructions can ensure acceptable outcomes. This article offers orthopaedic surgeons working in low-resource environments practical guidance to maintain standards of care through adaptable, cost-conscious decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Education significantly reduces poverty, enhances labour productivity, improves health outcomes and facilitates full participation in economic and community development. Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) encounter numerous obstacles in obtaining education. This study evaluated the OVC's educational institution enrolment rate and associated factors. This retrospective cross-sectional study used 2018-2024 programmatic data from OVC participating in PHN's Namibia DREAMS OVC program. The study included OVC aged 0 to 19&#x2009;years. Data were analysed utilising IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29. Chi-square tests and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Among the 16&#x2009;845 participants included in this analysis, 10&#x2009;607 (63.0%) participants were enrolled in an educational institution, 95% confidence interval (CI) (62.3%-63.7%). Among the 7393 participants aged 0-6&#x2009;years, 1735 (23.5%) were enrolled in an educational institution. Participants from Onandjokwe, Tsandi and Katima had a higher likelihood of being enrolled in an educational institution than those in Windhoek, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.42, 95% CI (1.07-1.87), AOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.69, 95% CI (1.09-2.61) and AOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.51, 95% CI (1.15-1.98), respectively. Participants aged 7-9 and 10-14&#x2009;years were more likely to be enrolled in an educational institution than those aged 15-19&#x2009;years, AOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.02, 95% CI (2.34-3.90) and AOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.29, 95% CI (2.64-4.09), respectively. Participants with male caregivers, HIV-negative caregivers and caregivers who had completed vocational training or tertiary education were more likely to be enrolled in an educational institution, AOR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.25, 95% CI (1.07-1.47), crude odds ratio (COR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.67, 95% CI (2.35-3.04) and COR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.34, 95% CI (1.09-5.01), respectively. Participants from households with no to moderate hunger, caregivers who had a source of income and those who were not sexually abused were more likely to be enrolled in an educational institution. It is essential to implement strategies that provide OVC tuition assistance and additional financial resources to meet their basic needs during their education. Providing food support to vulnerable households and meals in schools may enhance educational institution enrolment. Interventions are needed to increase the number of early childhood development (ECD) schools in the country.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the diagnostic impact of fixed orthodontic appliances on brain MRI under clinically realistic conditions, and to clarify the scope and focus of our Technical Note in response to commentary MATERIALS AND METHODS: Common orthodontic appliances, including brackets, archwires, molar bands, and transpalatal arches, were assessed in vivo during brain MRI. The analysis was designed as a Technical Note, with emphasis on empirical diagnostic imaging rather than detailed metallurgical characterization RESULTS: For most orthodontic configurations, brain MRI images remained interpretable across standard sequences. Severe artifacts were observed primarily in the presence of a transpalatal arch, especially in SWI and DWI sequences. These findings provide actionable insights for radiologists and orthodontists CONCLUSION: While theoretical alloy-based compatibility assessments remain valuable, empirical MRI data are indispensable in clinical practice, where detailed material information is often unavailable. Our study confirms that standard orthodontic appliances usually allow interpretable brain MRI, with specific exceptions CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study&#xa0;offers practical guidance for imaging patients with fixed orthodontic appliances. It highlights the&#xa0;need for interdisciplinary collaboration to establish standardized classifications of MRI-compatible products, building on both clinical imaging data and metallurgical analyses.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Teachers face high levels of occupational stress, which can influence their mental well-being and contribute to teacher burnout. Healthy levels of exercise, a good diet and adequate sleep can reduce stress and improve mental well-being outcomes. This study explores the characteristics and effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on teachers' mental well-being, including burnout; discusses directions for future programmes; and aims to identify the nature of evidence and gaps in the research field. Methods: A scoping review was conducted in May 2020 via ERIC, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Education Source, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Scopus databases. The search included relevant peer-reviewed articles on physical activity, nutrition and sleep interventions reporting teachers' mental well-being outcomes. A quality assessment tool was used to appraise the quality and risk of bias of the included studies. Results: Sixteen intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies incorporated physical activity into the intervention; however, only four included aspects of nutrition or sleep. No studies reported only nutrition or sleep interventions alone. The heterogeneity of interventions and their reported outcomes makes comparisons difficult. In general, the quality of the included studies was low due to small sample sizes, poor study design and incomplete reporting of information. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence suggests lifestyle interventions can improve mental well-being outcomes for teachers; however good-quality research is needed to improve the evidence base. Future interventions should have stronger research designs and larger sample sizes and use established measurements for assessing outcomes.",

However, the information is not always accurate, and individuals may be selectively choosing the information they read and follow. Additionally, although Americans have access to more health and wellness information than ever before, rates of obesity, hypertension, and sedentary lifestyles are still high. This study investigated information seeking for health and wellness-related resources by healthy, educated, young adults and their health and wellness perceptions and behaviors. Five focus groups were conducted with 35 young adults to gather information about diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management. The information-seeking skills and skepticism of information were high for this sample. They were more informed and practiced healthier behaviors related to nutrition and exercise than expected. However, they were less knowledgeable about good sleep hygiene and had varying sleep behaviors. The stress management techniques employed were a balance of healthy and unhealthy behaviors. This study's findings imply that it would be useful for family and consumer sciences educators and Extension professionals to add educational programming about good sleep hygiene and stress management techniques in addition to nutritional and healthy activity education.",

Participants: University students aged 18-25 years. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted in November 2019. Inductive thematic approach was utilized to identify themes. Results: Students (female: n = 13, male: n = 2, other gender identity: n = 1, 21.2 (1.6) years) reported mental well-being, physical activity levels, diet quality and sleep health were negatively affected. Stress, study demands, university timetabling, not prioritizing physical activity, cost and availability of healthy foods, and difficulty falling asleep were key barriers. Health behavior change interventions aiming to support mental well-being need to include both information and support features. Conclusions: There is a significant opportunity to improve the transition to university for young adults. Findings highlight areas to target in future interventions to improve physical activity, diet, and sleep of university students.",

Methods: Participants were randomized into an abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation, a mindful breathing, or a self-monitoring control condition for the 4-week intervention. Measures of physical relaxation, mindfulness, perceived stress, pre-sleep arousal, and insomnia symptom severity were collected. Results: The APMR group improved on five of the six dependent measures and was significantly different than the SM group at posttest, but not different than the MB group. Conclusion: The results suggests promise for brief, online, scaled back stress reduction interventions to reduce stress, arousal, and sleep difficulties in college students.",

Such programs replace weight loss advice with changes that center physical and mental well-being. Methods/Program Design: University health and wellness programs such as University Coaching for Activity and Nutrition (UCAN) is a novel weight-inclusive health and wellness coaching program designed to support university students and faculty/staff in their development and maintenance of self-care behaviors related to physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Specifically, we describe the program's mechanisms for participant recruitment, health coach training, session protocol, program evaluation, and supervision so other campuses can replicate the program model at their respective universities. Discussion: This work can help campuses cultivate positive self-care habits that improve physical and mental health through the lens of a weight-inclusive paradigm while also creating research and service-learning experiences for pre-health professionals.",

    "abstract": "Proper nutrition, adequate amounts of physical activity, and sufficient amounts of sleep are three important variables for healthy children. Alternative certification teachers quickly enter the classroom at the beginning of their programs and may encounter disengaged students who lack the energy needed for quality learning and achievement. Commonly, classroom management issues are the biggest challenges faced by new teachers in alternative certification programs (Evans, 2010). Children who receive proper nutrition, adequate amounts of physical activity, and sufficient amounts of sleep could be more receptive to learning and have the energy levels needed for dynamic and engaging classroom experiences. This article addresses nutrition, exercise, and sleep for students in the context of new teachers in alternative certification programs. Alternative certification teachers in the New York City Teaching Fellows program were surveyed to determine their attitude toward student health issues in the schools and it was found that teachers indicated student health issues to be important to them.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To understand the meanings of diet, physical activity, and body weight in the context of women's cancer experiences. Design: Grounded theory using 15 qualitative interviews and 3 focus groups. Setting: Grassroots community cancer organizations in the northeastern United States. Participants: Thirty-six white women cancer survivors; 86% had experienced breast cancer. Main Outcome Measures: Participants' views of the meanings of body weight, diet, and physical activity in the context of the cancer. Analysis: Procedures adapted from the constant comparative method of qualitative analysis using iterative open coding. Results: Themes emerged along 3 intersecting dimensions: vulnerability and control, stress and living well, and uncertainty and confidence. Diet and body weight were seen as sources of increased vulnerability and distress. Uncertainty about diet heightened distress and lack of control. Physical activity was seen as a way to regain control and reduce distress. Conclusions and Implications: Emergent themes of vulnerability-control, stress-living well, and uncertainty-confidence may aid in understanding and promoting health behaviors in the growing population of cancer survivors. Messages that resonated with participants included taking ownership over one's body, physical activity as stress reduction, healthy eating for overall health and quality of life, and a second chance to get it right.

    "abstract": "College students' mental health can be compromised by the exceeding demands of academia and other life stressors that can aversively impact their mood, sleep quality, and academic performance (Jordan et al., 2020; Silisteanu et al., 2022). Moreover, chronic exposure to high stress can increase risk of developing mental illness and other long-term health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer; highlighting the connection between psychological and physiological health (Bharwani et al., 2015; C. H. Liu et al., 2019; Ohrnberger et al., 2017). The relation between the brain's central nervous system and the gut's enteric nervous system may be better explained by the underlying mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, which can be directly and indirectly influenced by several lifestyle factors, including diet (Berding, Ahmed, et al., 2020; Clapp et al., 2017, Skonieczna-Zydecka et al., 2018). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of diet and lifestyle factors related to gut health on mental health among college students by employing a repeated measures design to assess diet composition and aspects of perceived stress across time. Results revealed a statistically significant three-way interaction between diet, stress, and sleep quality (p = &lt; 0.001), with increased psychological stress associated with poorer diet and sleep quality. Additionally, an exploratory analysis was conducted to examine aspects of nutrition that have been shown to be associated with promoting gut health and brain function (Ayakdas &amp; Agagunduz, 2023). The impact of consuming fiber rich diets comprised of microbiota accessible carbohydrates and other nutrients that influence psychobiotics are discussed to better understand the role of diet as a mediating factor between gut and brain health.

    "abstract": "Poor academic performance has been linked with particular lifestyle behaviors, such as unhealthy diet, short sleep duration, high screen time, and low physical activity. However, little is known about how lifestyle behavior patterns (or combinations of behaviors) contribute to children's academic performance. We aimed to compare academic performance across clusters of children with common lifestyle behavior patterns. We clustered participants (Australian children aged 9-11 years, n = 284) into four mutually exclusive groups of distinct lifestyle behavior patterns, using the following lifestyle behaviors as cluster inputs: light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity; sedentary behavior and sleep, derived from 24-hour accelerometry; self-reported screen time and diet. Differences in academic performance (measured by a nationally administered standardized test) were detected across the clusters, with scores being lowest in the &quot;Junk Food Screenies&quot; cluster (unhealthy diet/high screen time) and highest in the &quot;Sitters&quot; cluster (high nonscreen sedentary behavior/low physical activity). These findings suggest that reduction in screen time and an improved diet may contribute positively to academic performance. While children with high nonscreen sedentary time performed better academically in this study, they also accumulated low levels of physical activity. This warrants further investigation, given the known physical and mental benefits of physical activity.",

    "abstract": "Background: Individuals with cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS) report both lower physical activity levels and more insomnia than the general population. However, reliable data on adults with CDS are missing so far. The aims of the present study were three-fold: (1) to investigate the associations between CDS and physical activity patterns among young adults, and more specifically dimensions of physical activity (walking time/week, bicycling time/week, and aerobic physical activity/week), (2) to explore, if CDS scores, physical activity patterns, and insomnia were interrelated, and (3) to explore, if physical activity was directly or indirectly associated with CDS via decreased insomnia. Method: A total of 246 young adult students (M[subscript age] = 22.62; 56.3% females) participated in the present cross-sectional study. They completed a booklet of questionnaires covering socio-demographic information, cognitive disengagement syndrome (Adult Concentration Inventory; ACI), physical activity patterns (International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ), and insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index; ISI). Results: Higher scores for the ACI as a proxy of CDS were associated with lower physical activity patterns (durations of walking, bicycling, and aerobic exercising per week), and with higher scores for insomnia. Conditional effects modelings showed that while there was no direct and indirect association of physical activity on CDS scores, both a direct and indirect association of insomnia via lower physical activity on higher CDS scores was observed. Conclusions: Among a smaller sample of young adults, higher CDS scores were associated with lower physical activity patterns and with more insomnia. Given that standardized behavioral intervention programs are available to improve both daily and weekly physical activity patterns and insomnia, such interventions might also favorably improve CDS.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To determine whether improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), blood pressure (BP) and body composition previously seen after a 16-week exercise intervention (POST) with hypocaloric diet are maintained following six months (6M) of unsupervised exercise time. Methods: Overweight/obese, physically inactive participants with primary hypertension (HTN) (n = 190) were randomly assigned into an attention control group (physical activity recommendations) or one of three supervised exercise groups. After POST, all participants received diet and physical activity advice for the following 6M but no supervision. All anthropometric and physiological measurements were taken pre and post the 16-week supervised intervention period, as well as after 6M of no supervision. Results: After 6M: 1) body mass (BM) ([delta] = 2.5%) and waist circumference ([delta] = 1.8%) were higher (P &lt; 0.005) than POST, but lower (P &lt; 0.005) than pre-intervention (BM, [delta] = -5.1%; waist circumference, [delta] = -4.7%), with high-volume and high-intensity interval training group revealing a higher BM reduction ([delta] = -6.4 kg) compared to control group ([delta] = -3.5 kg); 2) BP variables were higher (P &lt; 0.001) compared to POST with no change from pre-intervention; and 3) CRF was higher compared to pre-intervention ([delta] = 17.1%, P &lt; 0.001) but lower than POST ([delta] = -5.7%, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: When an overweight/obese population with HTN attains significant improvements in cardiometabolic health POST intervention with diet restriction, there is a significant reduction following 6M when exercise and diet supervision is removed, and only recommendations were applied. These results suggest the need for a regular, systematic and supervised diet and exercise programs to avoid subsequent declines in cardiometabolic health.",

Design: Retrospective study incorporating quantitative (a self-completed survey) and qualitative (one-on-one interviews) methods. Methodology: Participants were women aged 18 or over; had no pre-existing medical condition that might be exacerbated during pregnancy (e.g. diabetes, heart condition); and had given birth in the last 12 months. Nineteen women agreed to one-on-one interviews and 100 women agreed to complete a mailed questionnaire. Qualitative data and quantitative data were analysed using a descriptive qualitative methodology and by using McNemar's test for correlated proportions, respectively. Results: Participants reported a significant reduction in their level of physical activity during pregnancy; a significant increase in consumption of fruit, vegetables and fibre, and a decrease in fast food consumption (all &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.05). Medical practitioners are the preferred source of health information but seem to provide insufficient information about health behaviours during pregnancy in relation to physical activity, diet and weight management. Conclusion: Women reported eating a healthier diet and reducing their level of physical activity during the antenatal period, compared to pre-pregnancy. There is a need to improve the provision of health information on physical activity, diet and weight management in the antenatal period.",

This study investigated the patterns of lifestyle behaviors among cancer survivors and differences in HRQOL between behavioral classes. Cancer survivors (n = 2,463) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Participants (N= 591) were predominately female (63%) and non-Hispanic White (90%). Survey items included self-reported physical activity, diet, smoking, sleep, HRQOL, and demographics. Behavioral classes were estimated by latent class analysis. Differences between classes were assessed by latent class regression. Compared with the &quot;healthy lifestyles&quot; class (higher probabilities of meeting aerobic/strength-based activity guidelines, high fruit/vegetable intake, and no sleep problems; 11% of sample), the &quot;sleep and diet problems with inconsistent physical activity&quot; class (higher probabilities of not meeting strength-based guidelines, low fruit/vegetable intake, some sleep problems; marginally higher probability of meeting aerobic guidelines; 41%) had poorer general and physical HRQOL. The &quot;poor physical activity and diet&quot; class (higher probabilities of not meeting aerobic/strength-based guidelines, low fruit/vegetable intake, and some sleep problems; 48%) had poorer general, physical, and mental HRQOL. Few participants exhibited healthy lifestyle patterns associated with HRQOL. The findings provide opportunities to develop differentiated multiple behavior-change interventions, targeted to two common patterns of behavior. A large subgroup of cancer survivors was susceptible to suboptimal physical activity and diet, warranting interventions exclusively targeting these behaviors. Another subgroup was susceptible to suboptimal physical activity, diet, and sleep, indicating interventions for this group should include strategies targeting these three behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Although research establishes that student characteristics exert considerable influence on learning outcomes, research concerned with e-learning satisfaction most typically focuses of factors associated with instructional design, curriculum and pedagogy. Fifty-eight first-year university e-students completed an online survey that queried their satisfaction with various e-learning experiences and their physical characteristics (i.e., activity level, perception of health, level of pain, sleep and fatigue, diet and nutrition and problematic use of alcohol) and psychological characteristics (i.e., self-efficacy, stress, obsessive-compulsive behaviours, self-esteem, loneliness, peer relations, social adjustment and social support). Stepwise regression analysis was conducted in order to determine which physical and psychological variables predicted student satisfaction with e-learning. Student social adjustment to university, perception of family support, problematic use of alcohol and obsessive-compulsive tendencies, in various combinations, explained as much as one-third of the variance in student e-learning satisfaction. As e-learning continues to evolve, student physical and psychological well-being may assume increased focus in virtual instructional contexts as students are supported in a variety of ways. E-students with, for example, problems with alcohol may be identified and directed to online sources of support. E-learning practice may have sufficiently matured to consider the many ways in which virtual connection can promote both learning and wellness or, preferably, that learning and well-being are not conceptualized as distinct phenomena.",

Data revealed a significant prevalence of insomnia in our sample (N = 100). There was also a strong correlation between trait anxiety and insomnia, in addition to a strong correlation between sleep-onset latency (e.g., pre-sleep experience) and sleep quality (e.g., post-sleep experience).

    "abstract": "Objective: Despite the popularity of weight loss interventions, research indicates these methods are ineffective for promoting long-term health. College age is a developmentally important age for developing lifelong health habits. FitU is a peer-led non-diet nutrition and physical activity (PA) mentoring intervention developed to promote lifelong health habits for college students. The purpose of this study was to examine the nutrition and PA outcomes of FitU participants. Design: Pre-experimental single group repeated-measures field study design with qualitative programme evaluation feedback at post-test. Setting: FitU participants met with both a nutrition and PA peer mentor four times each for a total of eight sessions. Method: Participants (N = 125) completed pre- and post-surveys about their nutrition and PA attitudes and behaviours. Results: FitU participants increased their eating competence from pre-to-post assessment and decreased their perceived barriers to healthy eating. Participants also increased their readiness to exercise and reported being more physically active. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a peer-led, non-diet mentoring intervention in promoting health-supporting habits among college students.",

    "abstract": "Chronic insomnia can lead to depression, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, workplace absenteeism, underperformance, and high employee turnover as well as medical issues such as Alzheimer's, hypertension, myocardial infarction, obesity, and diabetes. Researchers have argued that healthful sleep is the most important factor in predicting longevity over diet, exercise, and heredity. Previous studies consider insomnia but do not address the specific issue of the levels of insomnia experienced by school principals and superintendents in Missouri. The purpose of the study was to investigate the levels in school administrators based on gender, age, ethnicity, experience in the current role, the level of professional role, the size of district and school, socioeconomic status of the district, socioeconomic status of school and type of school setting. Using the Survey Monkey online service, a two-part survey was e-mailed to 2,936 principals and superintendents listed in the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education School Directory (Missouri, 2016). The survey was comprised with a measurement to obtain the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and a demographic questionnaire. The survey response rate was 28.3% (n = 874). The findings show that insomnia scores differed between genders with female principals having significantly higher insomnia scores compared to male principals. Insomnia scores also differed across age groups, revealing that principals between 41 and 50 years of age had significantly higher insomnia scores than principals 51 years and older. In addition, insomnia scores differed across school settings, which revealed that principals managing urban schools had significantly higher insomnia scores than those managing rural schools. Insomnia scores did not differ significantly across any of the factors concerning superintendents nor in comparisons between principals and superintendents.

    "abstract": "Although sleep is a necessary function, it is not always prioritized, especially among university students. Sleep deprivation can be detrimental to university students due to an impact on memory, focus, emotional regulation, and stress levels. There is a bi-directional relationship between sleep quality and stress levels. The vast majority,?if not all research studies involving sleep quality and stress interventions focuses?on the direct impact stress reduction techniques have on sleep quantity. The researcher's main objective in conducting this study was to?identify?if undergraduate university participants exposed to a behavioral sleep education intervention that focused on teaching sleep hygiene techniques to improve sleep quality would have significantly less perceived stress compared with participants exposed to an active control. This topic was also explored to clarify some of the recent ambiguous literature regarding the bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and stress. The researcher's secondary objective in conducting this study was to increase awareness regarding the importance of sleep among university students and equip participants with sleep hygiene techniques to form more productive sleep habits. The general population targeted in this study were undergraduate students in a large urban Midwestern university. The intervention was facilitated virtually using Qualtrics, which randomly assigned participants to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received a behavioral sleep education intervention and were randomly assigned three out of the six sleep hygiene modules: bedtime routine, exercise, nutrition, sleep environment, bedtime relaxation, and sleep schedule. Goal setting was included in each module to further encourage behavior change based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The control group also received three modules with a similar structure as the intervention group. In contrast, the active control did not encourage any behavior change or mention the benefits of sleep. Instead, the modulus focused on sleep facts including the history of sleep, the sleep cycle, and dreams. At baseline and post-intervention, both groups completed measures quantify the dependent variables: perceived stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item; sleep hygiene was measured by the Sleep Hygiene Index, and sleep quality was measured by the Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8b. Results demonstrated that participants in the behavioral sleep education intervention had lower perceived stress, more productive sleep hygiene behavior, and better sleep quality post-intervention compared with participants in the control group.

Purpose: To conduct a needs assessment with HS staff to: 1) understand perceptions, barriers and motivators to healthful behaviors; and 2) ascertain interest in a worksite wellness program. Methods: Surveys (n = 154) and telephone interviews (n = 25) were conducted with HS staff from eight Colorado HS centers (4 rural, 4 urban). Results: Findings indicate that 56% of teachers were overweight or obese, 89% wanted to be more active, and 86.6% desired wellness programming. Motivators consisted of relief of stress, health, and weight control; barriers included time, fatigue, and money; desired topics included nutrition, exercise, and stress management. Motivators, barriers and interest topics were consistent across surveys and interviews. Discussion and Translation to Health Education Practice: HS staff want and need comprehensive wellness programming. Wellness programming should be tailored to include nutrition, physical activity and stress reduction strategies utilizing multifaceted modes of delivery. Improved staff wellness and increased comfort with health and wellness topics could impact the school environment and young children's health.",

Participants: Three hundred fifty seven undergraduate students enrolled in U.S. colleges. Methods: Students completed an online survey. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine whether SSQ moderated the relationship between mindfulness and nutrition behavior. Results: SSQ moderated the relationship between mindfulness and nutrition behavior. The observe facet of mindfulness was the most predictive of nutrition behavior, whereas the observe and describe facets were the most predictive of exercise behavior. Conclusions: Interventions that target mindfulness and sleep quality may help promote healthy eating and increased exercise engagement in college students.",

The current study examined this association, including potential mediators (i.e., sleep disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and depression), in a sample of Veterans. SEM analyses revealed that exercise was directly and indirectly associated with suicide risk. Additionally, exercise was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and better sleep patterns, each of which was, in turn, related to lower suicide risk. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

    "abstract": "Many community-based lifestyle interventions targeting African Americans have reported positive effects on participants' dietary choices and physical activity habits. However, these effects vary and not all participants will have outcome changes. Moderation analysis can help explain differential effects observed, but are not often reported. Hence, the objective of this secondary analysis was to explore potential moderators of intervention dose effects on diet quality and physical activity outcomes in an effective lifestyle intervention. Delta Body and Soul III, conducted from 2011 to 2012, was a 6-month, church-based, multicomponent, educational intervention designed to improve diet quality and increase physical activity in rural Southern African American adults. Generalized linear mixed models were used to determine associations among indicators of intervention dose received by participants, potential moderators and health outcome changes. Results indicated only three baseline characteristics--employment status, food shopping frequency and individual with primary responsibility for meal preparation--moderated the effects of education session attendance on diet quality changes. No evidence for moderation of exercise class attendance effects on physical activity changes was found. Thus, this culturally targeted, multicomponent lifestyle intervention did induce positive health changes in participants with a range of sociodemographic characteristics and food shopping and eating behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Background: The rate of childhood obesity has more than tripled during the past 30?years. Research shows that prevention at an early age is more effective than treatment later in life. Energize is a multicomponent intervention incorporated into the school day that combines nutrition education and physical activity aimed at maintaining healthy weight among elementary school youth. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Energize program for changing dietary and physical activity habits compared to a control group of children not participating in the program. Methods: A total of 104, 3rd and 4th graders in 3 southern Indiana elementary schools took part in the study. A quasi-experimental design was used to assess dietary and exercise habits of students in Energize and control groups through 12-week diet/activity logs and post-test questionnaires after controlling for the pre-test results. Results: Energize reduced consumption of French fries and potato chips, but did not increase physical activity. Conclusions: This study provides future researchers with a foundation for preparing longer studies of Energize or to compare multiple years of a standardized Energize curriculum.",

Participants: Seven hundred and twenty-nine college-aged students participated between October 2016 and April 2017. Methods: Heart checks, consisting of a cross-sectional survey and biometric screening, were conducted on a large Midwestern university campus. Results: A small proportion of students (24.5%) engaged in the recommended 150+ minutes of physical activity per week and 7.9% consumed 5+ servings of fruit/vegetables daily. Half (49.6%) slept 7 hours or less per night. Biometric screenings found that 26.4% of the students had high stress, 31.9% were overweight or obese, and 17.3% had prehypertension or hypertension. Less sleep was significantly associated with higher risks of being stressed, being overweight/obese, and having elevated blood pressure. Conclusions: Early detection, treatment, and education is critical to identify individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease and to promote healthy lifestyle changes before heart disease develops or progresses.",

The COVID-19 pandemic heightened this experience. Healthful diets and sleep patterns are associated with improved physical and mental well-being. Purpose: The goal of this study was to identify if there was a relationship between changes in sleep and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A group of college students was surveyed online using Qualtrics software during the first two months of lockdown restrictions at a large, midwestern university in the United States. Results: More participants reported no changes in diet and increased hours of sleep than reported declines or improvements in diet, or reductions or retained sleep patterns. Participants who maintained their diet were likely to maintain their current sleep pattern. Conclusion: College students demonstrated resilience in healthful behaviors during the first two months of COVID-19 lockdown.",

Three groups were selected for the study: control, single treatment and social treatment under nutrition treatment, too. The groups that were under nutrition treatments should have information about the nutrition resources. This experiment was done for two years, 2013-2014. Results showed that sport has significant effect at 5% probability level on weight loss. Also, sport has significant effect at 5% probability level on illness percent decreasing, and decreasing of illness percent under single sport treatment was more than other treatments. The results showed that by increasing the cortisol reactivity ratio, the cortisol concentration at the end measurement decreased. This study concluded that doing daily exercise and using of benefit nutrition resource can be a new natural technique for coping with stress.",

Although previous research has shown the positive effects of parent-based sleep intervention, it was mainly focused on face-to-face modality, which might limit accessibility. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a telehealth-delivered parent-based sleep-focused intervention in treating insomnia in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder. A total of 62 parents/caregivers with a child with autism spectrum disorder and comorbid insomnia (aged 3-6 years) were randomized to receive either three weekly group sessions of sleep-focused intervention via Zoom with telephone support (n = 30) or treatment as usual (n = 32). The intervention group had significantly greater improvements in overall sleep problems (Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire total score; p &lt; 0.05), bedtime resistance (p &lt; 0.05), and sleep-onset delay (p &lt; 0.05) at post-treatment as compared to the treatment as usual group. The intervention group also showed significant improvements in overall behavioral and emotional problems (p &lt; 0.05), especially externalizing problems (p &lt; 0.05) as measured by Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and parental stress level (p &lt; 0.05) as measured by Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 as compared to the treatment as usual group (partial [eta][superscript 2] = 0.081-0.101).

Participants: College students enrolled in multiple sections of a general education class completed an online survey in January 2016 (n = 153; 18-52 years of age). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Outcome variables included emotional eating (EE), uncontrolled eating (UE), and cognitive restraint (CR) as measured by The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised. Bivariate analyses, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression were completed with significance at p[less than or equal to]0.05. Results: Higher EE was associated with higher stress levels and female sex (p &lt;0.001 and p=0.02) and higher UE scores were associated with higher perceived stress (p&lt;0.001) while lower UE scores were associated with tobacco use (p=0.03 regression, p=0.098, bivariate). Higher CR was associated with higher parental education and use of relaxation methods. Higher CR also was associated with perceived stress, but this relationship differed depending upon freshmen status and amount of physical activity, and a relationship with sleep was observed that differed depending upon freshmen status. Conclusion: Interventions to help college students reduce stress and improve sleep may improve eating behaviors.",

Fasting blood samples were assayed for glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Results: Insomnia was positively associated with stress of life events ([beta] = 0.28, p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety ([beta] = 0.46, p &lt; 0.001). Insomnia was related to elevated fasting insulin ([beta] = 0.12, p = 0.04) and triglyceride level ([beta] = 1.85, p &lt; 0.001). An inverse association was found between insomnia and HDL-cholesterol ([beta] = -0.45, p = 0.03). Sobel's test for mediation showed that stress of life events (p = 0.020) and anxiety (p = 0.013) mediated the relationship between insomnia and hypertriglyceridemia.

Understanding covariation in these attitudes and barriers is complex. We examined whether individuals could be grouped into a small number of categories that are easier to study. Interviews were conducted with 982 adults from two low-income, predominantly African American neighborhoods in the same city. Social cognitive constructs, including self-efficacy, social norms, and internal and external barriers to diet and exercise, and walking were self-reported. We measured moderate to vigorous physical activity with accelerometers and diet with 24-hour recalls. We conducted a latent profile analysis of attitudes and barriers to diet and PA and identified four classes: (a) &quot;moderate diet and negative exercise attitudes,&quot; where participants were roughly average on dietary attitudes but reported exercise-related challenges, including lower social support, outcome expectancies, physical functioning, and self-efficacy; (b) &quot;few barriers and benefits of healthy diet and exercise,&quot; where participants reported fewer barriers and lower outcome expectancies for diet and PA; (c) &quot;moderate overall attitudes,&quot; where participants had average scores on most indicators but below-average exercise self-efficacy and slightly more exercise barriers; and (d) &quot;positive overall attitudes,&quot; characterized by more positive attitudes toward both diet and PA across most domains, particularly regarding self-efficacy to overcome exercise barriers. These profiles could inform efforts to tailor individual-level interventions for diet and PA of persons at high risk of chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Insufficient sleep is a serious public health problem in college students. Exercise is a widely prescribed behavioral treatment for sleep and mood issues; however, more focused and gender-specific prescriptions are needed. The present study examined relationships between exercise, sleep, and mood in undergraduate men and women. Students (N = 866, 19.6 ± 1.4 years, 38.7% women) were recruited from campus recreation facilities and completed demographic, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, mood (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), and exercise questionnaires. The Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines were used to dichotomize those who did and did not meet weekly aerobic and strength training exercise recommendations. In men, greater exercise frequency associated with less daytime dysfunction ([beta] = 0.147) and less depressive mood ([beta] = -0.64, ps &lt; 0.05). In women, greater exercise frequency associated with earlier bedtime ([beta] = -12.6), improved sleep quality ([beta] = 0.17), increased positive affect ([beta] = 0.91), less depressive mood ([beta] = -0.71), and less anger ([beta] = -1.24, ps &lt; 0.05). Compared to men, women reported earlier bedtime, poorer sleep efficiency, and more anxiety and depressive mood (ps &lt; 0.05, n[subscript p][superscript 2] range: 0.01-0.04). Compared to individuals who met physical activity guidelines, those who did not meet the guidelines reported later bedtimes, less positive affect, more anxiety, and more anger (ps &lt; 0.05 n[subscript p][superscript 2]s = 0.01). Among men, those who met physical activity guidelines reported falling asleep more quickly than those who did not meet guidelines (n[subscript p][superscript 2] = 0.01, p = 0.007); however, no relationship between guideline adherence and sleep latency was observed in women. Adhering to physical activity guidelines may be important for optimal sleep and emotional health. Clinicians should consider gender when creating exercise prescriptions for sleep issues.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported a disruption in the lifestyle habits (LsHs) of post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the importance of LsHs for these young adults' physical and mental health and academic success, it is pertinent to examine whether these changes were maintained beyond the public health crisis. As post-pandemic data on the LsHs of post-secondary students in Canada remain limited, the aim of this study is to provide an overview. In October 2023, data on six LsHs (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet, sleep, screen time, drug and alcohol use) were collected from 2,283 students at 14 post-secondary institutions in Quebec, Canada. The resulting portrait suggests that habits relating to physical activity, sedentary behaviours and alcohol and drug consumption are healthier than before and during the pandemic. However, eating habits and screen time appear to be less healthy than before and during the pandemic. Sleep patterns, which were disrupted during the pandemic, seem to be returning to pre-pandemic levels. These results are discussed in the light of plausible explanations and suggest possible interventions to consider.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the importance of holistic health practices based on evidence from various studies ranging from stress and burnout prevention from holistic practices to administrative support in an educational setting. Through researching these studies, new questions arose as to whether a limit exists to the preventative measures that may be taken to help alleviate stress and the subsequent impact. Current resources appear unclear if there are compounding benefits that may be achieved by attempting multiple paths to correct the impact of COVID-19-induced stress and burnout. The research conducted during this study explored the causes of stress and burnout along with the many ways that stress and burnout reduction occur. The researcher then designed a survey that collected data from 68 educators on perceived stress and burnout levels, holistic health practices employed by educators, educator logging practices, and the administrative support given to educators. The survey produced significant data that indicated the employment of activity, social interaction, adequate rest, and a nutritious diet correlated the most with lower levels of stress. The researcher then suggested different ways to practically apply the findings in an educational setting, like having activity options available in schools, making nutritious eating more accessible, moderating work-life balance to ensure recovery time, and creating time to socialize. As a result, this study hopes to encourage educators to employ holistic health practices, administrators to develop cultures that promote holistic health practices, and researchers to further explore the benefits and interactions of holistic health practices specific to educators.

    "abstract": "Sleep problems are a frequent concern of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Research on modifiable lifestyle factors that may mitigate sleep problems is sparse. Therefore, we investigated how various body composition parameters are longitudinally associated with sleep problems from 6&#xa0;weeks up to 24&#xa0;months post-treatment. In a prospective cohort of 396 stage I-III CRC survivors, home-based repeated measurements were conducted at diagnosis and at four post-treatment time points. The insomnia scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (range: 0-100) was used to measure sleep problems. Anthropometric measurements of adiposity (BMI, fat percentage, waist-hip ratio) and of muscle mass and muscle function (mid-upper arm muscle circumference, handgrip strength) were employed. Linear mixed models were applied to analyze overall longitudinal associations, and hybrid models were used to disentangle inter- and intra-individual components. At 6&#xa0;weeks post-treatment, 47.0% of participants reported sleep problems and symptom severity was at its highest; a decline was observed thereafter. In confounder-adjusted models, no statistically significant overall longitudinal associations of different body composition parameters with sleep problems were found. Intra-individual analyses revealed that increases in BMI were related to less sleep problems over time (&#x3b2; per 1&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>: -2.8, 95% CI -4.4; -1.2). BMI increases in the first 24&#xa0;months post-treatment were associated with decreased sleep problems. These findings must be interpreted with caution due to the observational design, yet might suggest a potential link between weight regain and sleep problems among CRC survivors recovering from the physical and mental impact of cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a prevalent systemic disorder affecting approximately 1&#xa0;billion people worldwide, associated with severe outcomes such as sudden death and traffic accidents. Despite its significant impact, OSAHS is frequently underdiagnosed. The current gold standard for assessing OSAHS severity, overnight polysomnography, is both costly and inconvenient. This study aims to develop an automated method for detecting apnea and hypopnea events using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce computational costs. We introduce a novel Temporal Convolutional Network with a Linearly Scalable Attention Mechanism (ECG-TCN) designed to simultaneously detect both apnea and hypopnea events. The model was trained and validated using the University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database. The performance of ECG-TCN was evaluated based on per-segment classification accuracy and generalization capacity. The ECG-TCN model achieved an accuracy of 91.6% in per-segment classification, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional classification models. Additionally, the model exhibited high generalization capacity, indicating its robustness across different datasets. This study presents the first application of a temporal convolutional network with a linearly scalable attention mechanism for the simultaneous detection of apnea and hypopnea events. The ECG-TCN model offers a cost-effective and accurate alternative to traditional diagnostic methods, with the potential to enhance the early detection and management of OSAHS.",

    "abstract": "Leafy vegetables such as spinach are among the most important components in a nutritious diet but are highly perishable and susceptible to premature spoilage. Traditional practices in determining freshness have been qualitative and time-consuming and have consistently led to defective consumption decisions with unintended consequences on human health. To this issue, we introduce SpinachXAI-Rec, a multistage framework that is enabled by AI and is capable of automating the classification of spinach freshness and providing consumer recommendations. This framework is based on understandable deep learning. To guarantee class balance and feature diversity, a dataset consisting of 4005 original images of three spinach varieties (Malabar, Red, and Water) was expanded to 12,000 images (2000 per class across six categories: fresh and non-fresh). We trained three CNN architectures, DenseNet121, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0, on the Stage 1 augmented dataset. In performance, we saw DenseNet121 significantly outperform with 96% classification accuracy compared to ResNet50 (53%) and EfficientNetB0 (17%). Stage 2 improved representation of features by incorporating DenseNet121 embeddings and ViT-B/16 and Swin Transformer attention mechanisms. DenseNet121&#x2009;+&#x2009;ViT-B/16 obtained an F1-score of 0.95, which was further optimised to 0.97 in Stage 3 using a multiclass SVM classifier. GradCAM++ and LIME were employed to incorporate interpretability during Stage 4. LIME provided transparent explanations of the significance of class-specific features, while GradCAM++ effectively highlighted disease-affected or spoilt regions. The most effective model (DenseNet121&#x2009;+&#x2009;ViT&#x2009;+&#x2009;SVM) also obtained a Dice coefficient of 0.89 and an IoU of 0.82, which confirms the precision of localisation and segmentation. Finally, Stage 5 introduces a clinical recommender system that is based on rules and relates prediction confidence to real-world categories: Eatable, Eatable with Caution, or Not Eatable. This AI-driven recommendation assists food purveyors and consumers in making health-conscious, well-informed decisions. SpinachXAI-Rec is a significant advancement in the development of safer food systems, as it provides interpretable AI for the purpose of freshness validation and actionable consumption recommendations, thereby empowering both consumers and industry stakeholders.",

Data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort were analyzed. AAC and severe AAC (SAAC) were quantified using the Kauppila scoring system. Multivariate linear and logistic regression were applied to examine the correlation between SIRI and AAC scores, as well as SIRI and SAAC. The predictive value of SIRI and the Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII) for SAAC was compared using ROC curves and Delong test. A nomogram model for SAAC prediction was also constructed. A total of 3,047 participants were included. Results showed a significant positive association between SIRI and higher AAC scores, with scores increasing progressively across higher SIRI quartiles. A similar positive trend was observed between SIRI and SAAC prevalence. Subgroup analysis revealed that the relationship between SIRI and AAC scores was stronger in the elderly. The SAAC predictive model, incorporating SIRI and other factors, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 in the training set and 0.81 in the validation set. This study suggests that higher SIRI is positively associated with both AAC and SAAC, with superior predictive value for SAAC compared to SII.",

Fisetin (FIS) is a flavonoid compound with multiple biological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of FIS on MAFLD and the underlying mechanisms through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Our results demonstrated that FIS mitigated weight gain and improved blood glucose levels, blood lipid disorder and liver steatosis in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MAFLD. RNA-seq analysis revealed that FIS affected the expression of many genes in the liver of MAFLD mice, including up-regulating the mRNA expression of Glut4 and GPx3 and down-regulating the mRNA expression of IL-1&#x3b2; and Cxcl10 genes. Moreover, FIS reduced sodium oleate-induced lipid accumulation, activated the GSK-3&#x3b2;/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, and inhibited the expression of PEPCK and G6PC in HepG2 cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate that FIS can alleviate MAFLD by enhancing the antioxidant capacity and reducing the gluconeogenic capacity in the liver, supporting FIS as a potential therapeutic against MAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD) is a severe ocular condition characterized by the detachment of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium and caused by retinal tears. Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) is the standard surgical procedure for RRD, and is intended to remove the vitreous gel, which shapes the eye, and provides mechanical and nutritional support to the retina. The study of the vitreous proteome isolated from RRD patients may help decipher the pathobiology of the disease and that of its complications, such as proliferative vitreo-retinopathy (PVR), which predispose to recurrent retinal detachment (observed in 20% of cases), a sight threatening condition. Herein, we set up a pilot shot-gun proteomics study (Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD057155) to investigate the perturbations of vitreous proteome comparing RRD patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) to patients affected by idiopathic Epiretinal Membranes (ERM), used as controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8). Spectra were first searched and analyzed to identify proteome perturbations. Thereafter, starting from the hypothesis that RRD could be sustained by altered proteolytic processing of structural and non-structural elements of vitreous gel, N- and C-termini were mined to uncover endogenous proteolytic events. Our search revealed a comprehensive array of proteolytic events and sites across numerous proteins. While some of these were previously documented in different biological samples (like plasma, cell models, etc.), our findings point to new, potentially specific cleavage sites on macromolecular components unique to the vitreous fluid and retinal layers (e.g., interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 1 and 2). Comparison between the N- and C-termini landscapes and the perturbations of global proteome highlighted robust alterations of the repertoire of cleaved proteins between RRD patients and reference control subjects. Additional immunoblotting studies on a selection of proteins envisage that RRD is characterized by unbalanced proteolysis of structural and non-structural components involved in the regulation of immune processes, proteolytic control and, particularly, angiogenesis.",

This study investigates the feasibility of using a remotely controlled computer tomography (CT) scanner at a decentralized medical center (DMC) to expedite prehospital intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The study involved three phases: technical implementation and testing, procedure development, and clinical training. We used a Siemens Healthineers Syngo Virtual Cockpit system to remotely control the CT scanner at the DMC. This enabled use of the scanner without a radiographer on call at the DMC. Eligibility criteria for undergoing prehospital IVT at the DMC were established. Paramedics, nurses, and physicians underwent comprehensive training on stroke assessment, CT scanner operation, and communication protocols. Technical testing demonstrated excellent feasibility of the system. Simulation exercises showed efficient teamwork,&#xa0;achievement of door-to-needle times (DNT) below 20&#xa0;min, and NIHSS score consistency in 95%&#xa0;of cases. Risk assessment identified potential challenges, with mitigation strategies implemented. This study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging existing infrastructure to remotely control a CT scanner at a DMC, for prehospital IVT in a rural setting. This approach is promising for improving timely stroke diagnosis and treatment in rural areas.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of cumulative ecological risk (CER) on college students' physical activity patterns (PAP) and to analyze the mediating effect of exercise atmosphere (EA) and self-control (SC), with the aim of promoting the convergence of university physical education with community sports and helping college students to form a healthy physical lifestyle. A total of 966 college students were selected from schools in Beijing, China, and a cross-sectional survey of cumulative ecological risk, physical activity patterns, exercise atmosphere, and self-control was conducted using four scales. Differences, correlations and mediated models were analyzed using ANOVA, Pearson and structural equation modelling (SEM). CER negatively predicted PAP (&#x3b2;=-0.293, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), SC (&#x3b2;=-0.523, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), and EA (&#x3b2;=-0.352, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). EA positively predicted SC (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.358, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) and PAP (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.084, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), while SC positively predicted PAP (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.256, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Mediation analysis using the Bootstrap method indicated that CER affected PAP both directly and indirectly through three significant paths: Direct effect: CER&#x2192;PAP (effect size&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.636). Indirect effects: CER&#x2192;EA&#x2192;PAP, CER&#x2192;SC&#x2192;PAP, and CER&#x2192;EA&#x2192;SC&#x2192;PAP (combined effect size&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.364). This also indicates that CER can directly reduce PAP among college students, while effectively enhancing EA and SC, thereby mitigating the negative effects of CER. (1) CER directly affects college students' sport lifestyles, and family and school risks account for the largest proportion of the total, so resolving an individual's relationship with family and school is an important way to improve sport participation. (2) Both EA and SC positively predict PAP and mitigate the negative effects of CER on it, so increasing the levels of both is also an effective way to improve individuals' sport experiences.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading global cause of mortality and a major contributor to disability. As inadequate nutrition accounts for approximately 50% of cardiovascular deaths, understanding the impact of different dietary patterns is crucial. This study aimed to compare cardiovascular risk factors and 10-year cardiovascular risk in adults following a vegetarian (VG) or omnivorous (OM) diet. Cardiovascular risk was calculated using SCORE2, body composition was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biochemical parameters were determined from capillary blood, and diet quality was evaluated using the 14-item Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence questionnaire for OM, and the healthful plant-based diet index for VG. A cross-sectional design was performed with 110 participants (55 OM and 55 VG). No significant differences between groups were found in the 10-year cardiovascular risk. However, for biochemical parameters, OM showed higher levels of total cholesterol (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), LDL cholesterol (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), and non-HDL cholesterol (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). Conversely, for body composition, VG men showed lower Appendicular Lean Mass Index (ALMI) values (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). Upon analyzing diet quality, high adherence to the MD in the OM group (OR 0.861; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and high diet quality in the VG group (OR 0.590; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) were protective factors against high cardiovascular risk. When reanalyzing data only for individuals with high-quality diets, OM individuals showed lower values of fat mass (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) and Visceral Adipose Tissue (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023). Meanwhile, VG individuals showed significantly lower total cholesterol levels (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013). A high-quality VG diet demonstrated better results concerning lipid profile, while an OM diet with high adherence to the MD showed greater potential regarding body composition. Additionally, the key factor for optimal cardiovascular health does not seem to be related to a specific dietary pattern but rather to the quality of the diet adopted.",

    "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in restoring cellular metabolic homeostasis after energy stress. Importantly, AMPK acts as a hub of metabolic signaling, integrating multiple inputs and acting on numerous downstream targets to activate catabolic processes and inhibit anabolic ones. Despite the importance of AMPK signaling, unlike other well-studied pathways, such as MAPK/ERK or NF-&#x3ba;B, only a handful of mechanistic models of AMPK signaling have been developed. Epistemic uncertainty in the biochemical mechanism of AMPK activation, combined with the complexity of the AMPK pathway, makes model development particularly challenging. Here, we leveraged uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods and recently developed AMPK biosensors to construct a new, data-informed model of AMPK signaling. Specifically, we applied Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection to ensure that model predictions and assumptions are well-constrained to measurements of AMPK activity using recently developed AMPK biosensors. As an application of the new model, we predicted AMPK activity in response to exercise-like stimuli. We found that AMPK acts as a time- and exercise-dependent integrator of its input. Our results highlight how UQ can facilitate model development and address epistemic uncertainty in a complex signaling pathway, such as AMPK. This work shows the potential for future applications of UQ in systems biology to drive new biological insights by incorporating state-of-the-art experimental data at all stages of model development.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) representing the primary cause of mortality in this population. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 2,227 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2003-2018) to investigate the relationship between phthalate exposure and self-reported CVD among CKD patients. Logistic regression identified four phthalate metabolites exposure, including MBP, MEHHP, MEOHP and MECPP significantly increases CVD risk across all three logistic regression models. As phthalate exposure typically occurs as a mixture in real life, we employed advanced mixture analysis methods: the Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) model, Quantile G-Computation (qgcomp) model, and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) model. All the three models consistently demonstrated a positive association between phthalate mixtures and CVD in CKD patients. Furthermore, network toxicology analysis revealed that PPARG, CASP9 and CTSS play important roles in mediating the pathogenic mechanisms linking phthalate exposure to both CKD and CVD. These findings suggest that phthalate exposure is associated with adverse effects on cardiovascular health in CKD patients. As common hub genes linking CKD and CVD, PPARG, CASP9, and CTSS may contribute to the toxic effects of phthalate exposure on both diseases, suggesting as potential therapeutic targets. However, given the cross-sectional nature of NHANES data, causal inferences cannot be made, and the potential for reverse causality and residual confounding should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pulmonary complications are a common and significant concern following head and neck surgeries. Patients with oral and maxillofacial cancer are particularly susceptible to reduced pulmonary function, impaired exercise capacity and diminished quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been widely validated as an effective intervention for managing respiratory diseases, improving functional capacity and enhancing health-related quality of life. However, a critical gap persists in developing PR programmes specifically tailored to the distinct physiological and functional challenges faced by patients with oral and maxillofacial cancer. This protocol introduces an innovative PR intervention uniquely designed to address these challenges, bridging the gap in current rehabilitation practices and offering a comprehensive approach to improve recovery outcomes. This single-blind, two-arm, randomised controlled trial will enrol 144 patients with oral and maxillofacial malignancies from a tertiary hospital in China. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=72), receiving routine care alongside a tailored PR programme designed by the research team, or the control group (n=72), receiving routine care alone. The primary outcome is pulmonary function, which is assessed using pulmonary function tests. Secondary outcomes include exercise capacity, quality of life and cancer-related fatigue. Outcomes will be assessed at three time points: baseline (T0), before discharge and 2&#x2009;months postdischarge (T1), allowing for evaluation of both immediate and sustained intervention effects. The trial has received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University (WCHSIRB-D-2025-025).

    "abstract": "Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions characterised by pathological behaviours related to food intake, often accompanied by a chronic obsession with weight control. Their prevalence is increasing, with an earlier onset and greater severity among young people. Universal prevention, through multicomponent strategies that tackle modifiable risk factors, has emerged as a promising tool. This paper reports the study protocol designed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the PRETA (Prevenci&#xf3;n de los Trastornos de la Alimentaci&#xf3;n) programme in reducing the risk of eating disorders and related modifiable risk factors among preadolescents in the school setting. The PRETA programme will be assessed by means of an open, community-based, multicentre, controlled trial using 1:1 matched-pairs cluster randomisation at the school level. Schools in Tenerife (Spain) will be assigned to the PRETA programme or a waitlist control group. Participants include 5th- or 6th-grade students (10-13 years old), their parents and teachers. The PRETA programme is a universal, school-based, multicomponent programme designed to reduce eating-disorder risk and modifiable risk factors. Its main component is an interactive online platform called e-PRETA, complemented by training sessions for families and teachers. e-PRETA includes nine 45-minute sessions addressing risk factors, such as dietary habits, beauty standards, media literacy, self-esteem, emotional regulation and social skills. A total of 1068 children from 12 schools will participate. The primary outcome will be the risk of developing eating disorders (Children's Eating Attitudes Test-26 item version). Secondary outcome measures are body dissatisfaction (Adapted Contour Drawing Rating Scale), eating disorder traits (Eating Disorder Inventory-2), internalisation of appearance ideals (Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4) and self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and postintervention (3&#x2009;months). Additional baseline covariates such as electronic device use, parental feeding attitudes, physical activity, sleep duration and screen time will also be collected. Programme effectiveness will be analysed using generalised mixed models. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by comparing the incremental costs associated with the implementation of the PRETA programme with its estimated effectiveness. Ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee for Research with Medicines at the University Hospital of the Canary Islands (CHUC_2021_78). Written informed consent will be obtained from the parents or legal guardians of all participants. Results will be disseminated through scientific publications and conferences. NCT06792981.",

Furthermore, the impact of POCUS training on paramedics' knowledge, confidence in use, and attitudes toward POCUS devices was assessed. Thirty-seven paramedics who were engaged in providing prehospital emergency care were selected. A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test study was conducted between February 5 and March 20, 2025. Participants underwent a comprehensive POCUS training involving theoretical lectures, hands-on sessions, and simulation-based exercises. A significant improvement in overall POCUS knowledge, confidence in use, and diagnostic accuracy were noted on the post-test survey. Pre-test knowledge scores averaged 2.57 on a 5-point scale, whereas post-test scores exceeded 4 in all assessed categories. Confidence in using POCUS devices improved from a mean of 1.51 (not confident) to 3.51 (moderately confident). Training influenced attitudes, as 97% of participants recommended POCUS in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) practice. Point-of-care ultrasound training can influence diagnostic abilities. The implementation of POCUS devices in the prehospital setting can improve clinical decision-making, ultimately leading to improvement in patients' outcomes.",

An action research approach was used. Process evaluation included webinar observation to identify behaviour change and adult learning techniques used and post-webinar acceptability surveys. Impact evaluation examined changes in knowledge, attitudes, practices and self-efficacy using online surveys before and 1&#x2009;month following webinars. Interviews with PHPs and facilitators informed process and impact evaluation. Thirty-six webinars were delivered from 2022-24, 1246 PHPs registered, and 463 attended live. Facilitation style reflected adult learning principles and incorporated behaviour change techniques targeting knowledge and skill improvement. Facilitators and attendees valued the national scope of the program but highlighted challenges achieving national reach and meeting the needs of a broad audience. Over 90% of attendees provided positive feedback in acceptability surveys; this was reflected in qualitative feedback: attendees enjoyed the practical, interactive content and opportunity to review program material. There was low uptake of effectiveness surveys. In qualitative interviews, PHPs reported intent to change practice; however, the extent of implementation of program content into clinical practice varied. CPD regarding early childhood health promotion and obesity prevention was well received by PHPs. Future programs should consider incorporating comprehensive impact evaluation. SO WHAT?: Findings should inform future program design, including the need for interactive and practical education. Reach and sustainability of future programs may be enhanced through integration into existing education services for PHPs.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence (AI) coaches show promise for personalized exercise and health interventions. However, the unique demands of ensuring safety and real-time, multimodal personalized feedback have created a fragmented evaluation landscape lacking standardized frameworks. This scoping review systematically maps current evaluation strategies for LLM-based AI coaches in exercise and health, identifies strengths and limitations, and proposes directions for robust, standardized validation. Following PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we conducted a systematic search across 6 major databases (eg, PubMed, Web of Science) for original research on LLM-based exercise and health coaching. Studies were included if they explicitly reported on evaluation methods. We extracted and synthesized data on model types, application domains, and evaluation strategies and developed a 5-point Evaluation Rigor Score (ERS) to quantitatively assess the methodological depth of the evaluation designs. We included 20 studies, most using proprietary models like ChatGPT (75%). Evaluation strategies were highly heterogeneous, mixing human ratings (80%) and automated metrics (40%). Crucially, the evidence was limited by low methodological rigor: the median ERS was 2.5 out of 5, with 55% of studies classified as having low rigor. Key gaps included limited use of real-world data (40%) and inconsistent reliability reporting (45%). The current evaluation of LLM-based health coaches is fragmented and methodologically weak. Future work must establish multidimensional validation frameworks that integrate technical benchmarks with human-centered methods to ensure safe, effective, and equitable deployment.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a prevalent concern among older adults, often leading to complex cardiovascular complications when uncontrolled. Telenursing technology facilitates self-management, and the integration of domain-specific ontology allows real-time interpretation of behavioral and biometric data to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing patient engagement and self-care. This study aimed to examine the within-group and between-group effects of self-health monitoring using smart devices combined with ontology technology on hypertension-controlling behavior and mean arterial pressure among older adults with uncontrolled hypertension. The quasi-experimental design was conducted with 91 older adults in Bangkok, Thailand (46 experimental and 45 comparison participants). Participants in the experimental group used the \"HT GeriCare@STOU\" app on smartphones, linked to smartwatches for blood pressure monitoring, step count, and sleep pattern, with telenursing support via video calls. Data on hypertension-controlling behavior were collected using a validated questionnaire (Cronbach &#x3b1;=0.83; content validity index=0.98). Descriptive statistics and t tests were used to analyze within-group and between-group differences. Within-group analysis revealed that experimental participants showed improved hypertension-controlling behavior and reduced mean arterial pressure after the program. Between-group comparisons indicated that mean arterial pressure in the experimental group was significantly lower than in the comparison group (P&lt;.05), although hypertension-controlling behavior did not differ significantly between groups. Older adult participants and nurses reported high satisfaction, noting that real-time feedback increased awareness of blood pressure and motivated independent health behavior adjustments. Self-health monitoring using smart devices integrated with ontology technology effectively improved physiological outcomes and supported self-management in older adults with uncontrolled hypertension. The ontology framework enabled personalized, real-time decision support, highlighting its novelty, and potential to enhance nursing practice. Future studies with larger samples and longer follow-up are recommended to further evaluate the intervention's effectiveness and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Dietary choices are shifting globally in ways that are directly affecting both the environment and human health. Building on the Diabetes Epidemiological Survey, and the latest data from the China Statistical Yearbook, this study quantified Chinese people's dietary ecological footprint per capita (EFP) and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the provincial level with different prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes. Results demonstrated that groups with a lower prevalence of diabetes showed lower dietary EFP, while the dietary EFP and GHG emissions peaked among the prediabetes group with a prevalence of 32.7%-34.9%, and then decreased significantly with the increasing prevalence of prediabetes. The increasing prevalence of diabetes was tightly linked to increased consumption of pork, poultry, seafood, eggs, and vegetables. Moreover, the over-consumption of meat, oil, and cereal, together with the under-consumption of vegetables, fruits, eggs, and milk, will further increase both the prevalence of diabetes and environmental degradation. Yet, people's concern for their health will drive them to pursue a healthier diet, which in turn will promote environmental sustainability. Findings in this study can help to reshape the dietary patterns that can effectively reduce the environmental and health impacts not only in China but also in other countries with accelerated diet-environment-health trilemma.",

    "abstract": "Mobile apps are a promising way to improve healthy lifestyle behavior among people with infertility. However, sufficient engagement with mobile health apps is crucial to influence health outcomes, and identifying features to create more effective interventions is urgently needed. This study conducted a process evaluation focusing on the use and user experience of the PreLiFe app, a mobile lifestyle app for couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). A mixed methods approach was used among heterosexual couples with infertility undergoing IVF. An objective quantitative study using a tracking-based system assessed the actual use of the PreLiFe app over time in relation to partner use and in relation to the specific fertility treatment. A subjective quantitative study using online questionnaires assessed the acceptability (using the Mobile App Rating Scale) and partner support (based on the Social Support for Diet and Exercise Scale) experienced while using the PreLiFe app. A subjective qualitative study using semistructured interviews evaluated in-depth user experiences with the PreLiFe app. A total of 106 couples used the PreLiFe app for 2 to 365 days. Overall use was low; 18.9% (20/106) of the men and 49.1% (52/106) of the women used all the modules of the PreLiFe app. Mixed-model analyses revealed that higher app use was observed when a partner used the app as well and during fertility treatment. The average acceptability score was 6 (SD 1) of 10, and patients felt supported by their partners while using the app. Semistructured interviews with 10 patients indicated that the PreLiFe app was easy to use. Our findings showed good acceptability and user experiences but low actual objective use of a preconception lifestyle app for couples undergoing IVF. To increase use of and engagement with such apps, future studies should further focus on personalization and interaction with partners, health care providers, and other patient data systems.",

    "abstract": "Family-focused interventions promoting lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity and healthy eating can be effective strategies for obesity management in children. To maximize public health impact, there is an urgent need to develop innovative solutions to improve the scalability of childhood obesity management interventions. Stand-alone web-based interventions are easily administered but may be hindered by low participant engagement and limited support. A blended intervention that includes both facilitated web-based group sessions and self-guided resources may enhance engagement, thereby optimizing improvements in children's health outcomes. However, the long-term effectiveness of stand-alone versus blended web-based interventions to manage childhood obesity has not yet been evaluated. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a blended, web-based, family-focused healthy living program (Family Healthy Living Program [FHLP]) compared to an active control (self-guided web-based educational resources) in lowering BMI z scores in children with overweight or obesity over 12 months. The secondary objective is to examine intervention effects on children's physical activity, dietary behaviors, and health-related quality of life as well as parental self-efficacy and motivation to support children's lifestyle behaviors. This single-blind 2&#xd7;4 trial aims to recruit 278 parent-child dyads across Canada to be randomly assigned to the FHLP intervention group or an active control group (1:1 ratio). The 10 weeks of FHLP activities have been designed based on the multiprocess action control framework to support children and parents in learning behavioral change skills that will enable them to improve their healthy lifestyle behaviors, and the FHLP delivery has been piloted previously. Families in the intervention group will receive weekly web-based synchronous group sessions and access to additional resources and suggested activities. Families in the control group will receive access to 10 weeks of self-guided web-based educational resources only. Outcomes, including child's height and weight, daily physical activity, dietary behaviors, health-related quality of life, and parental support, will be measured via questionnaire at 4 assessment time points over 1 year (ie, baseline, 10 wk, 6 mo, and 12 mo). Intervention engagement and attrition will also be recorded. Multiple linear regression models will be used to examine the effectiveness of the FHLP intervention compared to stand-alone web resources only. This study was funded in 2020, with 270 participants enrolled between January 2021 and May 2024. The 12-month data collection period ended in June 2025 and data analysis is currently underway. Study results are expected to be published in winter 2025. Results will be disseminated via conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and other media channels. The blended web-based FHLP intervention has the potential to become a scalable solution for the prevention of obesity and related health conditions.

    "abstract": "With an aging global population, cognitive decline in older adults presents significant healthcare challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that physical activity can support cognitive health by promoting plasticity, functional reorganization, and structural adaptation of the brain. In the FIT4BRAIN study, we examined the effects of multi-component physical activity on cognitive and brain health. Here, we report the results on one of the secondary outcomes, namely changes in brain age (BrainAGE), which estimates the difference between chronological and predicted brain age based on structural MRI data, and changes in brain structure, assessed through voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Ninety-two healthy older adults were randomized into a multi-component physical activity group, performing aerobic, coordination, and balance exercises, or an active control group engaging in non-aerobic relaxation exercises and educational content (physical activity group (PAG): 36 participants; active control group (CON): 33 participants). Of these, 69 participants underwent MRI assessment and were included in the present analyses. BrainAGE analyses revealed a greater decrease in the physical activity group compared to the control group, indicating a beneficial effect of physical activity on brain aging. Subgroup analyses based on baseline cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) further revealed that participants with lower CRF showed greater benefits, consistent with VBM findings of structural changes in the same subgroup. These results underscore BrainAGE as a sensitive biomarker for intervention outcomes and suggest that stratification by baseline fitness level may help identify differences in the benefits of physical activity on brain health.",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SCT intervention and the nutritional status, adverse events, and treatment status of patients with HNC undergoing CCRT. This study enrolled 40 patients with HNC who underwent CCRT. The primary endpoint was the body weight (BW) loss rate. The secondary endpoints were energy intake, incidence of adverse events, and treatment completion rate. BW loss rate (9.0&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.0 vs. 5.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.4%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017) was significantly lower in the SCT intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) than in the non-SCT intervention group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20).

We examined the association between work-related PA (WPA) or leisure-time PA (LTPA) and advanced fibrosis across the steatotic liver disease (SLD) spectrum. Data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017-2020) in adults with hepatic steatosis were included and categorized into MASLD (n=2236), MetALD (n=1355), and ALD (n=457) based on alcohol use. PA was quantified as metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week, and &#x2265;600 MET-min/wk was used as the threshold for high activity. Adjusted logistic regression models for confounders (sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, metabolic risk factors, and etiology of SLD) were used to analyze the relationship of PA types with at-risk advanced fibrosis, according to an Agile 3+ score &#x2265;0.45. Among 4342 SLD participants, LTPA was strongly linked to a lower risk of at-risk advanced fibrosis in MASLD (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93), as well as MetALD and ALD combined (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.34-0.89). WPA was not associated with improved advanced fibrosis. There were no interactions between WPA and SLD subtypes (p=0.98), and between LTPA and SLD subtypes (p=0.55). LTPA but not WPA is protective for at-risk advanced fibrosis in patients with MASLD and MetALD. These findings showcase the importance of structured LTPA interventions to mitigate fibrosis risk in SLD. Larger studies are needed to examine the benefits of PA in patients with ALD and to delineate exercise prescriptions for patients with SLD.",

One hypothesis is that there is a strong relationship between fatigue, sleep problems, and self-efficacy, and that fatigue decreases self-efficacy. The aim of this study was to explore self-reported fatigue from the time on the waiting list to 5 years after heart transplantation and its association with self-efficacy and sleep problems. In this multicenter, longitudinal cohort study 48 heart recipients, 12 women and 36 men with a median age of 57 years, were followed from pre-transplant to 5 years post-transplant. Three instruments were used: (1) the transplant-specific Organ Transplant Symptom and Well-Being Instrument (OTSWI), (2) the Swedish version of the Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), and (3) the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale (SES6G). Sleep problems decreased after transplantation, but after 3-5 years, there were no differences in comparison with pre-transplant. Self-efficacy improved for the whole group from pre-transplant up to 5 years after heart transplantation. General fatigue predicted self-efficacy. Fatigue plays a pivotal role in self-efficacy after heart transplantation. It reduces self-efficacy due to causing uncertainty and should constitute a primary target for future interventions.",

    "abstract": "The evidence supporting the many beneficial effects of physical activity, including exercise, is overwhelming. This has led to numerous publications, statements, and position stands providing evidence-based recommendations to realize the performance-enhancing and therapeutic benefits of exercise. However, one factor hampering research and limiting the adoption of these recommendations is the inconsistent use of terminology associated with different exercise intensities. The goal of this international group of researchers and practitioners, therefore, was to propose standardized physical activity and exercise intensity terminology that has utility across all ages, sexes, genders, physical abilities, conditions, applications, and activities. After much discussion, we propose a standard terminology for physical activity, exercise, and sport and human performance comprising five exercise intensities: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. We also propose five different descriptors for the perception of effort that align with the five intensities we have suggested: very easy, easy, somewhat hard, hard, and very hard. To enable consistent use of these descriptors with both cardiorespiratory and resistance exercise, we suggest not using descriptors such as light, heavy, weak, or strong (which might be perceived as only being applicable to describing load). We appreciate that some fields have long-established terminology and may be reluctant to change. Nonetheless, at a minimum, the terminology proposed here allows for more clarity when comparing the different exercise intensity descriptors currently used by different fields. Finally, we hope this will be an important \"first step\" in harmonizing the descriptions of exercise intensity across the fields of physical activity for public health, exercise science, and sport science.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) are both highly prevalent among the elderly and have a substantial impact on their quality of life. However, the association between sarcopenia and IDD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether sarcopenia is independently associated with an increased risk of IDD in middle-aged and older adults, using prospective data from the UK Biobank. A total of 378&#x2009;773 participants from the UK Biobank were included and categorized into three groups based on the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) criteria: normal, probable sarcopenia and confirmed sarcopenia. The association between sarcopenia and IDD was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Sensitivity analyses included subgroup analyses to assess the robustness of findings and interaction tests to explore potential effect modifiers. The median age of participants was 59&#x2009;years, with females accounting for 54.8% of the cohort. Over a median follow-up duration of 171&#x2009;months, 10&#x2009;585 participants developed IDD. In unadjusted Cox regression analyses, compared to the normal group, the hazard ratios (HRs) for IDD were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.41-1.61) in the probable sarcopenia group and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.14-1.90) in the confirmed sarcopenia group. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the corresponding HRs were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.26-1.44) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.10-1.80), respectively. These associations remained consistent across subgroup analyses. Notably, in BMI-stratified analyses, individuals with sarcopenia and a BMI&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;25 had a higher risk of IDD (HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.31-2.71) compared to those with BMI&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;25 (HR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.06-2.16), with a significant interaction (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of IDD, particularly in overweight or obese individuals. Regular assessment of muscle strength and mass, along with promoting physical activity and adequate nutritional interventions in ageing populations, may help prevent sarcopenia and delay the onset of IDD.",

    "abstract": "Women during hormonal transitional phases present an increase in mood disturbances. Recently, purified and specific cytoplasmic pollen extract (PureCyTonin&#xae;), a natural non-hormonal alternative, has proven to be effective to treat symptoms during perimenopause, and menopause especially vasomotor ones. However, its effects on mood disturbances still need further study. To investigate the potential <i>in vitro</i> effects of the pollen extract on dopaminergic and GABAergic systems in order to be proposed as an alternative to treat symptomatic midlife women and other brain-related symptoms. <i>In vitro</i> experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of pollen extract on dopamine and GABA uptake, as well as GABA<sub>A</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2S</sub> receptor binding. Pollen extract inhibited both dopamine and GABA uptake in a concentration-dependent manner (mean IC&#x2085;&#x2080;&#x2009;=&#x2009;79.5&#x2009;&#xb5;g/mL and 137&#x2009;&#xb5;g/mL, respectively). It also displaced [&#xb3;H]-muscimol from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, suggesting potential allosteric modulation. Contrary to this, pollen extract showed moderate affinity for D<sub>2S</sub> receptors (&#x2265;1000&#x2009;&#xb5;g/mL). These mechanisms might enhance neurotransmitter tone in hormone-sensitive brain regions. Purified and specific pollen extract modulates dopaminergic and GABAergic systems <i>in vitro</i> and help restore neurochemical balance across hormonal transitions, supporting its non-hormonal beneficial role in managing mood, sleep, and somatic symptoms with a safety profile. There is a need for further research in this regard in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been widely associated with DN in observational studies; however, the causal nature and direction of this association remain uncertain. To clarify this, we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using large-scale genetic datasets. Genetic instruments for OSA were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising up to 476,853 individuals, while genetic associations for DN were obtained from another GWAS including 452,280 participants. We applied multiple MR methods to ensure robust causal inference, including inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode. Sensitivity analyses were thoroughly conducted using Cochran's Q test for heterogeneity and the MR-Egger intercept test to assess potential pleiotropy. Furthermore, multivariable MR was employed to evaluate the independent effect of OSA on DN after adjusting for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. The results indicated a significant causal effect of OSA on DN risk, supported by IVW (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.12-1.77, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003) and weighted median estimates (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16-2.13, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Reverse MR analysis revealed no evidence of a causal effect of DN on OSA. Importantly, after accounting for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, multivariable MR confirmed that OSA exerts an independent causal influence on DN (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.14-1.67, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021). These findings suggest that OSA may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy through specific mechanisms, independent of traditional metabolic risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Background/Aims: The prevalence of sarcopenia and osteopenia/osteoporosis is increased in chronic pancreatitis (CP). This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and related factors of osteosarcopenia in CP patients. Materials and Methods: Eighty-three CP patients were included in this cross-sectional observational study. Sarcopenia was assessed by measuring the surface area of the paravertebral muscles at the third lumbar region. Pancreatic fecal elastase (PFE) tests evaluated exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), while dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans assessed osteopenia/osteoporosis. EORTC PAN26 and a symptom questionnaire were administered, alongside nutritional marker assessments concurrent with PFE. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia and osteopenia/osteoporosis was found to be 22.9% (n = 19) and 68.7% (n = 44), respectively. Factors associated with sarcopenia included male gender (OR: 4.9, P = .044), severe EPI (OR: 4.2, P = .043), smoking (OR: 4.6, P = .040), and zinc deficiency (OR: 2.2, P = .029). Severe EPI was significantly associated with osteopenia/osteoporosis (P = .010), diabetes mellitus (P = .001), sarcopenia (P = .016), and zinc deficiency (P = .012). Individuals with osteoporosis had higher PAN26 scores (P = .029). Factors independently associated with osteopenia/osteoporosis included female gender (OR: 7.8, P = .004), severe EPI (OR: 8.1, P = .003), and sarcopenia (OR: 5, P = .037). The prevalence of osteosarcopenia was 19.2%. Conclusion: Osteosarcopenia is common in CP patients. Smoking, zinc deficiency, EPI, and male gender are strongly associated with sarcopenia. Screening for osteosarcopenia is essential in CP patients to facilitate appropriate interventions.",

    "abstract": "Poor diet during pregnancy compromises maternal-fetal health and may reflect broader environmental and structural inequities. This study investigated differences in dietary intake across pregnancy among rural and urban women in the United States and assessed whether socioeconomic status (SES) modified rural-urban differences. In this prospective study, pregnant women (n = 495; 22.4% rural) from three sites (Iowa, Pennsylvania, West Virginia) had dietary intake estimated via the 26-item Dietary Screener Questionnaire (DSQ) during each trimester. Rural was defined as Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code &#x2265; 4. A SES score was derived using Principal Component Analysis of education, annual household income, and insurance type. Adjusted robust linear mixed-effects models (controlled for site, age, minority status, pre-pregnancy BMI) compared dietary intakes between rural and urban participants, with trimester and SES interactions. Compared to their urban counterparts, rural participants had higher predicted intakes of added sugars from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in the first (0.61 tsp eq/day; 95% CI: [0.04, 1.18]) and second trimesters (0.62 tsp eq/day [0.05, 1.21]), and less fiber across all trimesters (ranging from -0.90&#xa0;g/day [-1.7, -0.1] to -1.2&#xa0;g/day [-2.0, -0.3]). Women in the high-SES urban group had higher intakes of fiber and calcium, and lower intakes of SSBs compared to their low-SES counterparts in both rural and urban settings. Although rurality was associated with greater SSBs and lower fiber intake, differences were modest. Low-SES was related to a poorer diet regardless of geography, highlighting the need for targeted interventions for both rural and urban low-SES pregnant women.",

    "abstract": "Phytoestrogens (PEs), a class of naturally occurring plant compounds primarily categorized into isoflavones, lignans, flavonoids, coumarins, and stilbenes, exhibit structural similarity to endogenous estrogens and exert regulatory effects through estrogen receptors. This comprehensive review examines the multifaceted roles of PEs in enhancing exercise performance and promoting health among postmenopausal women. Current evidence demonstrates that PEs not only ameliorate characteristic menopausal symptoms but, more significantly, improve physical function through multiple mechanisms: (1) augmenting muscle protein synthesis while mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress to optimize muscular performance; (2) modulating glucolipid metabolism and cardiovascular function to establish physiological foundations for exercise; and (3) preserving bone mineral density and regulating neurotransmitter activity to maintain motor coordination. Although combined PE-exercise interventions demonstrate synergistic benefits, their efficacy is influenced by dosage variations and interindividual metabolic differences. Future investigations should prioritize the development of precision PE applications to optimize kinesiological outcomes and health parameters in postmenopausal populations.",

    "abstract": "A targeted metabolomics study was conducted on the bile acid profiles in the liver and feces of rats induced by a high-fat diet and intervened by ginsenoside Rb_1, along with the detection of FXR pathway gene expression in the liver, to explore and clarify its mechanism of action. The content of biochemical indicators in the serum were detected using an automatic biochemical analyzer. Hematoxylin and eosin(HE) staining and oil red O staining were used to detect pathological changes and lipid deposition in the liver. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of FXR, small heterodimer partner(SHP), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase(CYP7A1), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c(SREBP-1c) in the liver. Targeted bile acid metabolomics technology was employed to analyze changes in bile acid profiles in liver tissue and feces, and a correlation analysis was performed between key genes such as FXR, SHP, CYP7A1, SREBP-1c and differential bile acid metabolites. The results showed that ginsenoside Rb_1 significantly reduced the levels of total cholesterol(TC), triglycerides(TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C) in the serum, alleviated the large fat vacuoles and lipid deposition in the liver, increased the expression of FXR mRNA in the liver, and decreased the expression of SREBP-1c mRNA. The expression of CYP7A1 and SHP mRNA was increased, but the differences were not statistically significant. Targeted bile acid metabolomics showed that ginsenoside Rb_1 could restore the levels of 9 bile acids in the liver and 8 bile acids in the feces. Ginsenoside Rb_1 also increased the percentage of taurocholic acid(TCA) in the liver(56.78%) and the percentage of 12-ketolithocholic acid(12-KLCA) in the feces(26.10%). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed two pathways involved in bile acid metabolism: primary bile acid biosynthesis and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. Correlation analysis showed that FXR, SHP, CYP7A1, and SREBP-1c were positively correlated with multiple differential bile acids. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rb_1 may intervene in lipid metabolism disorders induced by a high-fat diet by regulating the FXR pathway and modulating bile acid profiles in the liver and feces.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effects of Yueju Pills on depression and cardiovascular diseases have been widely recognized. Previous studies have shown that the drug can significantly improve depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS) combined with atherosclerosis(AS). Given the complex pathogenesis of psychocardiac diseases, this study integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology to systematically elucidate the mechanism of Yueju Pills in alleviating depressive symptoms in psychocardiac diseases. The results demonstrate that, after Yueju Pill intervention, the levels of 9 abnormal metabolites in the hippocampus restore to normal ranges, primarily involving key pathways or signaling pathways, including the cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP), mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR), glycine/serine/threonine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. In a high-fat diet-induced CUMS ApoE~(-/-) mouse model, Yueju Pills significantly increases adenosine monophosphate(AMP) levels and decreases L-alanine and D-glyceric acid levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, Yueju Pills exert antidepressant effects by regulating multiple metabolic axes, including glycine/serine/threonine metabolism and the cAMP, mTOR signaling pathways. Network pharmacology predictions reveal that the treatment of CUMS combined with AS by its core active components may be realized through modulating pathways concerning neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity, including serine/threonine-protein kinase 1(AKT1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1(MAPK1), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2(PTGS2). This study provides a theoretical reference for the clinical application of Yueju Pills in alleviating the depressive symptoms of psychocardiac diseases.",

    "abstract": "Based on serum metabolomics and gut microbiota technology, this study explores the effects and mechanisms of the water extract of Ziziphi Spinosae Semen(SZRW) and the petroleum ether extract of Ziziphi Spinosae Semen(SZRO) in improving depressive-like behaviors induced by sleep deprivation. A modified multi-platform water environment method was employed to establish a rat model of sleep deprivation. Depressive-like behaviors in rats were assessed through the sucrose preference test and forced swim test. The expression of barrier proteins, such as Occludin, in the colon was determined by immunofluorescence. UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS was utilized to analyze the serum metabolic profiles of sleep-deprived rats, screen for differential metabolites, and analyze metabolic pathways. The diversity of the gut microbiota was detected using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Spearman correlation coefficient analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between differential metabolites and gut microbiota. The results indicated that SZRO significantly increased the sucrose preference index and decreased the immobility time in the forced swim test in rats. A total of 34 differential metabolites were identified through serum metabolomics. SZRW and SZRO shared five metabolic pathways, including phenylalanine metabolism. SZRW uniquely featured taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, while SZRO uniquely featured linoleic acid metabolism and tyrosine metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed that SZRW could upregulate the abundance of Bilophila, promoting the production of indole-3-propionic acid and subsequently upregulating the expression levels of intestinal tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1. SZRO could indirectly influence metabolic pathways such as arginine metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism by upregulating the abundance of gut microbiota such as Coprococcus and Eubacterium species. Both SZRW and SZRO can regulate endogenous metabolism, including amino acids, energy, and lipids, alter the gut microbiota microecology, and improve depressive-like behaviors. SZRO demonstrated superior effects in regulating metabolic pathways and gut microbiota structure compared to SZRW. The findings of this study provide a scientific basis for elucidating the pharmacodynamic material basis of Ziziphi Spinosae Semen.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota regulates intestinal nutrient absorption, participates in modulating host glucolipid metabolism, and contributes to ameliorating glucolipid metabolism disorder. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can compromise the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, induce inflammatory responses, and exacerbate insulin resistance and abnormal lipid metabolism in the host. Dangua Humai Oral Liquid, a hospital-developed formulation for regulating glucolipid metabolism, has been granted a national invention patent and demonstrates significant clinical efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Dangua Humai Oral Liquid on gut microbiota and the intestinal mucosal barrier in a mouse model with glucolipid metabolism disorder. A glucolipid metabolism disorder model was established by feeding mice a high-glucose and high-fat diet. The mice were divided into a normal group, a model group, and a treatment group, with eight mice in each group. The treatment group received a daily gavage of Dangua Humai Oral Liquid(20 g&#xb7;kg~(-1)), while the normal group and model group were given an equivalent volume of sterile water. After 15 weeks of intervention, glucolipid metabolism, intestinal mucosal barrier function, and inflammatory responses were evaluated. Metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics were employed to analyze changes in gut microbiota and associated metabolic pathways. Significant differences were observed between the indicators of the normal group and the model group. Compared with the model group, the treatment group exhibited marked improvements in glucolipid metabolism disorder, alleviated pathological damage in the liver and small intestine tissue, elevated expression of recombinant claudin 1(CLDN1), occluding(OCLN), and zonula occludens 1(ZO-1) in the small intestine tissue, and reduced serum levels of inflammatory factors lipopolysaccharides(LPS), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein(LBP), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;(TNF-&#x3b1;). At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidota decreased, while that of Firmicutes increased. Lipid-related metabolic pathways were significantly altered. In conclusion, based on the successful establishment of the mouse model of glucolipid metabolism disorder, this study confirmed that Dangua Humai Oral Liquid effectively modulates gut microbiota and mucosal barrier function, reduces serum inflammatory factor levels, and regulates lipid-related metabolic pathways, thereby ameliorating glucolipid metabolism disorder.",

    "abstract": "While the genome codes for all proteins an organism can express, only certain sets of proteins are expressed in defined cell types. A cell's phenotype is influenced by the life-stage, exposure to signal molecules, as well as the exposome, i.e., external influences including physical stressors or chemicals from food, the environment or microorganisms. The interplay between genetics and these exposures is termed gene x environment interaction (GxE). Epigenetics contributes to GxE by modifying the accessibility of genes and thus their ability to be translated to proteins. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and changes in local DNA packaging. As genetics and the exposome often jointly contribute to disease, understanding epigenetics may enable a better understanding of many human pathologies. Often, epigenetics will retain the memory of exposure, which changes an organism's susceptibility to subsequent, other exposures. This concept may allow new insights into mixture toxicity, especially when the exposures do not take place at the same time. Knowledge on epigenetic processes provides a basis for novel drugs that modify cell phenotypes (e.g., in cancer or neurodegenerative disease). Here, we provide an overview of the role of epigenetics in toxicology, and we call for a systematic assessment of epigenetic changes as part of investigative, and possibly regulatory, toxicity assessments. We propose tools and strategies for using human-relevant models, biomarkers, and AI to better predict who may be at risk. Ultimately, adding epigenetics to toxicology will help us create safer products and protect vulnerable individuals and future generations. Our genes are not the whole story when it comes to how our bodies respond to chemicals, medicines or environmental stress. A level of control &#x2013; called epigenetics &#x2013; determines which genes are turned on or off without changing the DNA itself. Detrimental epigenetic changes can be caused by external exposures like pollution, diet or drugs, and they may affect our health in long-lasting ways. This article explores how such &#x201c;epigenetic toxicity&#x201d; works, how it can lead to diseases like cancer or developmental disorders, and why current safety testing may miss it. We argue that epigenetic effects should be considered alongside traditional genetic damage in safety assessments of new drugs. We propose tools and strategies for using human-relevant models, biomarkers, and AI to better predict who may be at risk. Adding epigenetics to toxicology will help us create safer products and protect vulnerable individuals and future generations.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with both abnormal hormone secretion and dyslipidaemia. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) can induce postmenopausal dyslipidaemia. This study aimed to explore the relationship between FSH and dyslipidaemia among male OSA patients. A total of 257 subjects admitted to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology for uvulopalatopharyngoplasty between August 2020 and September 2022 were screened. Sleep breathing monitoring data, biochemical indicators, and physical measurements were collected. Spearman correlation tests were used to analyse the correlation between FSH and lipid levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for dyslipidaemia as assessed by the presence of hyper-TC, hyper-LDL-C, hypo-HDL-C and hyper-TG. The potential mediating role of FSH was estimated by the mediation analyses. A total of 194 patients with OSA were ultimately included. Participants with a higher FSH had more severe OSA, had higher TG levels and higher percentages of hyper-TG. A positive dose-response relationship was observed between FSH and OSA severity or TG (P for trend both &lt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between FSH and TG (<i>r</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.281, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Furthermore, after adjusting for multiple variables, including age, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, OSA severity, and oestradiol, FSH was significantly associated with hyper-TG, with ORs (95% CIs) across higher FSH quartiles of 2.791 (1.115, 6.987), 3.242 (1.272, 8.264), and 4.163 (1.441, 12.022), respectively. A significant positive linear trend was observed (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.020 for a linear trend). In addition, FSH had a 14.8% mediating effect on the relationship between OSA severity and hyper-TG. FSH was independently associated with hyper-TG and played a significant mediating role in the relationship between OSA and dyslipidaemia.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated psychological distress, but limited information is available on the shifts in mental health symptoms and their associated factors across different stages. This study was conducted to more reliably estimate shifts in mental health impacts and to identify factors associated with symptoms at different pandemic stages. We performed a national repeated cross-sectional study at stable (2021), recurrence (2022), and end-of-emergency (2023) stages based on representative general national population with extensive geographic coverage. Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and insomnia symptoms were evaluated by GAD-7, PHQ-9, IES-R and ISI scales, respectively, and their associated factors were identified via multivariable linear regression. Generally, 42,000 individuals were recruited, and 36,218, 36,097 and 36,306 eligible participants were included at each stage. The prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms increased from 13.7-16.4% at stable to 17.3-22.2% at recurrence and decreased to 14.5-18.6% at end of emergency, while PTSD symptom continuously increased from 5.1% to 7.6% and 9.2%, respectively (all significant, <i>P</i>&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Common factors associated with mental health symptoms across all stages included centralized quarantine, frontline work and residence in initially widely infected areas. Centralized quarantine was linked to anxiety, depression, PTSD and insomnia during the stable, recurrence and end-of-emergency stages. Frontline workers exhibited higher risks of anxiety, depression and insomnia throughout these stages. Individuals in initially widely infected areas were more likely to experience depression and PTSD, particularly during the stable and recurrence stages. Stage-specific risk factors were also identified. Lack of outdoor activity was associated with anxiety, depression and insomnia during the stable and recurrence stages. Residents in high-risk areas during the recurrence stage correlated with increased anxiety and insomnia. Suspected infection was tied to anxiety and insomnia in the recurrence and end-of-emergency stages, while the death of family or friends was linked to PTSD during recurrence and to depression, PTSD and insomnia at the end-of-emergency stage. Mental health symptoms increased when pandemic recurred, and could remain after end-of-emergency, requiring prolonged interventions. Several key factors associated with mental symptoms and their variations were identified at different pandemic stages, suggesting different at-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive description of the profile of chiropractic practices and services provided can help guide curriculum design, inform quality improvement and guideline initiatives, and facilitate workforce planning. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, professional activities, work organization, clinical practice patterns, and interprofessional referrals of chiropractors in France. A 37-item online questionnaire was administered between February and April 2023 to all registered chiropractors practicing or having a chiropractic-related professional activity in France, for whom an email address was available (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1067). We computed means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. Representativeness of the results was estimated by comparing survey participants' demographic information with members of the Association Fran&#xe7;aise de Chiropraxie (AFC). The response rate was 46.4% (67.7% females; mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;34.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.7&#xa0;years), a sample comparable to AFC members. Most participants graduated in the past 15 years (81%) from the Institut Franco-Europ&#xe9;en de Chiropraxie (IFEC) (94.5%). Just over one fifth of respondents had an additional university degree, and a similar proportion were involved in at least one chiropractic-related professional activity, mainly as lecturers in the IFEC or supervising clinicians in its outpatient clinics. Over half of the respondents (53.5%) had their main practice location in one of the four most populated regions in France, with 27.4% working in a multidisciplinary setting. Chiropractors reported regularly referring patients to general practitioners and physiotherapists, but less commonly received referrals. Middle-aged adults most commonly sought care, and spinal pain was the primary complaint reported by chiropractors. Chiropractors generally provided advice and education, manual therapy, and exercises. Two-thirds of respondents reported feeling moderate (30.6%) to intense or very intense (31.7%) competition with other manual therapy practitioners. The French chiropractic workforce appears predominantly composed of female practitioners who graduated in the past 15 years. Practice patterns and continuing education choices suggest that evidence-based information is part of their practice. While chiropractors commonly reported referring patients to other care providers, fewer reported receiving referrals. Patients seeking chiropractic care were similar to those described in other countries.",

    "abstract": "Adults in rural Australia are at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To date, no intervention trials have evaluated the impact of dietitian delivered nutrition therapy using telehealth exclusively in patients recruited in the primary care setting. The primary aim was to assess effectiveness of telehealth delivered Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) on change in dietary intake energy, reported as percent energy derived from nutrient-dense (core) foods. Secondary aims included assessment of the intervention effects on percentage weight loss, quality of life, health literacy and patient engagement in their health (patient activation). This was a secondary data analysis of a pragmatic cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Adults from rural areas within the New England North West and Upper Hunter regions of New South Wales, Australia, were identified by their general practitioner (GP) following a Heart Health Check, as being at moderate-to-high risk of CVD and invited to participate. General practices were randomised into intervention or usual care groups. Intervention participants received five personalised telehealth MNT consultations over 6 months. Usual care received stand-alone personalised nutrition reports. All participants were managed by their GP and followed up after 12 months. Primary and secondary outcomes were analysed using Bayesian linear mixed models. Models included fixed categorical effects for time, group, group-by-time interaction, age, and sex, with additional predetermined adjustment for variables determined by the literature. Mean baseline to 12-month increase in percentage of energy from core foods was 7.0% (9.4 SD) for the intervention group and 1.3% (9.6 SD) for usual care group, with an estimated adjusted difference in mean change of 5.9% (95%CI 0.5-11.2). Significant improvements in quality of life (0.04, 95%CI 0.01-0.07) and patient activation were also observed (6.44, 95%CI 0.99-11.83) favouring the intervention group. A personalised telehealth MNT intervention delivered by dietitians significantly improved percentage energy from nutrient-dense foods amongst rural adults at an elevated risk of CVD. Future research is required to support implementation of telehealth MNT into general practice in rural Australia. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621001495819).",

Nevertheless, deficiencies in these elements remain a global concern. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated biofortification of edible plants offers a sustainable and effective strategy to enhance crop nutritional value. This review synthesizes current knowledge on (i) NP types and formulations, highlighting how particle size, composition, and surface properties influence nutrient delivery; (ii) application methods, including soil amendments, foliar spraying, and seed nanopriming, emphasizing their efficiency and limitations; and (iii) mechanisms of NP uptake, translocation, and accumulation in edible tissues, identifying factors that affect bioavailability. Compared with conventional fertilization, NP-based approaches deliver micronutrients more effectively, promote better plant growth, and enhance nutritional content. We also discuss key research gaps, environmental and economic challenges, and regulatory considerations that need to be addressed to ensure safe and scalable implementation. By overcoming these barriers, NP-mediated biofortification can significantly contribute to combating micronutrient deficiencies and improving global food security.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory burden index (IBI) has been recently proposed as a comprehensive marker of systemic inflammation. This study investigated the association between IBI and erectile dysfunction (ED). We analyzed data from 2,117 male participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2004. Participants were categorized into ED and non-ED groups. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the association between IBI and ED occurrence. Smooth curve fitting examined potential non-linear relationships between IBI and ED. Among 2,117 male participants, 644 (30.42%) were diagnosed with ED. After full adjustment, IBI demonstrated a significant positive association with ED (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.26, 95% CI: 1.54-3.31, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). Participants in the highest IBI quartile (Q4) had a substantially elevated ED risk compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.89, 95% CI: 1.61-5.21, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0004). Smooth curve fitting confirmed a positive correlation between IBI and ED. Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent associations across different strata. IBI showed superior predictive performance for ED (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6475, 95% CI: 0.6223-0.6727) compared to other inflammatory markers including CRP (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6279), SIRI (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6121), NLR (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6027), and SII (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.5580). Our NHANES database analysis demonstrated a significant positive association between IBI and ED. IBI exhibited superior predictive capability for ED compared to established inflammatory markers. These findings suggest IBI's potential utility in clinical settings for identifying individuals at elevated ED risk. However, clinical implementation should be considered exploratory pending validation in diverse prospective populations.",

    "abstract": "Veteran Response to Dosage in Chiropractic Therapy (VERDICT) was a pragmatic randomized trial testing chiropractic dosage effects in 766 veterans with chronic low back pain (CLBP) of &#x2265;&#x2009;3 months. This cross-sectional analysis compares baseline characteristics of younger (18-to-64 years) and older veterans (&#x2265;&#x2009;65 years). Data were collected from February 22, 2021 to May 21, 2025 via electronic health records and REDCap questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and tests of group differences were performed using SAS. VERDICT enrolled 188 older veterans (25%; mean 72 years) and 578 younger veterans (75%; mean 44 years). More female (24.7% vs. 10.6%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), Black (18.9% vs. 12.2%), and Hispanic (11.8% vs. 3.7%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001) veterans comprised the younger cohort. Employment differed (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) with older veterans retired (78.2% vs. 14.2%) and younger veterans employed (59% vs. 16.5%). About 14% lived rurally and period of military service was similar. Pain profiles were similar between younger and older veterans for &gt;&#x2009;5 years duration (78.4% vs. 73.4%), high-impact chronic pain (64.5% vs. 62.2%), mean pain interference [63.8(4.8) vs. 63.2(5.0)], and mean back-related disability (primary outcome) [11.9(5.2) vs. 13.3(4.9)]. Younger veterans scored significantly higher than older veterans for depression (44.8% vs. 31.4%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001), anxiety (41.5% vs. 20.7%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), post-traumatic stress (38.4% vs. 17.6%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), sleep disturbance (57.1% vs. 34.6%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), and high-risk alcohol use (25.4% vs. 18.1%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.05). Previous chiropractic use was similar (younger 75.4% vs. older 80.3%). Medications in past 3 months differed with younger veterans reporting cannabis (25.8% vs. 12.8%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and muscle relaxants (31.7% vs. 17.6%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and more older veterans reporting acetaminophen (63.3% vs. 49.3%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and gabapentin (34% vs. 20.1%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). NSAIDs use was highest among both younger (62.8%) and older (56.9%) veterans. While two-thirds had tried exercise in the past 3 months, only 16% reported exercising for their pain condition, with older veterans more likely to report providers encouraging physical activity. Similar pain profiles were reported among older and younger veterans seeking chiropractic care for CLBP within a clinical trial.

    "abstract": "Malaria remains the leading cause of morbidity in Guinea. Early diagnosis of malaria infections and prompt administration of appropriate treatment are two essential elements in reducing severe morbidity and mortality associated with malaria infection. This study aims to identify how community norms can shape caretakers' care-seeking behavior for fever in children under five in Guinea. This study uses data from the 2021 Guinea malaria and anemia indicators survey to analyze the factors associated with mothers' access to care for children under five with fever in Guinea. The survey's results are representative at the national level, in urban and rural areas, and across each of Guinea's eight administrative regions. Each region was stratified into urban and rural areas, except for Conakry city, which is entirely urban. Three questionnaires-the Household Questionnaire, the Woman's Questionnaire, and the Biomarker Questionnaire-were used to collect data. This study uses information collected through the household and women's questionnaires only. Community norms were assessed through two statements (1) Whether the respondent agrees that people in the community usually take their children to a healthcare provider on the same day or the day after they develop a fever, and (2) Whether the respondent agrees that people in the community, who have a mosquito net usually sleep under it every night. Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with early care-seeking behaviour with crude and adjusted odds ratios. 921 children who had fever during the 2&#xa0;weeks preceding the interview were included in the analysis: 110 from Conakry, 113 from Boke, 103 from Faranah, 188 from Kankan, 137 from Kindia, 113 from Lab&#xe9;, 55 from Mamou, and 102 from Nzerekor&#xe9;. After controlling for all variables in the model, early care-seeking in children under-five with fever was positively associated with the mother's perception of community norms about care-seeking and the use of mosquito nets (OR: 1.98, [1.29-3.02]) as well as living in a household in the middle wealth quintile as compared to households in the lowest quintile OR: 1.87, [1.04-3.37]. It was negatively associated with living in Bok&#xe9; (OR 0.25, [0.10-0.66]), Kindia (OR: 0.42, [0.18-0.94]), and Lab&#xe9; (OR: 0.30, [0.13-0.70]) compared to living in Conakry. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at changing behaviour in Guinea can significantly benefit from reinforcing community norms around early care-seeking for children under five with fever. Using mothers who take their children to a health facility as soon as the fever develops as role models can encourage others in the community. More efforts are needed in Bok&#xe9;, Kindia and Lab&#xe9;.",

    "abstract": "The Confident Moves (CM) intervention is a newly developed, theory-based online intervention to promote physical activity (PA) in adults with obesity by providing a set of theory-informed behavior change techniques intended to enhance participants' self-efficacy for PA. Uncertainties remain regarding the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the CM intervention in an obesity care center, where additional supports (e.g., meal plans, appetite suppressants) are typically provided. The objective of this longitudinal pilot trial was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the CM online intervention for adults with obesity recruited from a local weight management center in the United States of America, in preparation for a future definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT). This study was designed as a prospective, individually randomized, two-arm pilot trial. Data were collected across three waves over a period of up to 14 weeks, depending on each participant's progression. Thirty participants were randomized to either the CM intervention group or the usual care group. The survey battery assessed demographic characteristics, anthropometric measures, self-efficacy, and acceptability. Free-living PA was objectively measured using a research-grade accelerometer (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT). Primary outcomes included: (a) participation rate, (b) engagement behavior in CM, and (c) a preliminary estimate of the CM intervention's effect size on PA. Secondary outcomes (e.g., consent rate) were also evaluated. Predetermined threshold values outlined in a protocol guided the assessment of each outcome. Data analyses included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Supporting evidence (i.e., meeting or exceeding the predetermined upper threshold) was found for all primary outcomes (i.e., participation rate, engagement behavior in CM, and preliminary effect size of CM on PA). Mixed evidence (i.e., meeting or exceeding the upper threshold, within the middle threshold range, or below the lower threshold) was observed for secondary outcomes. This longitudinal pilot trial supports the viability of a future definitive RCT of the CM intervention and highlights areas for refinement in study procedures, intervention duration, and assessments. The findings also suggest important directions for optimization and real-world implementation, particularly through partnerships with obesity care.

    "abstract": "Bone and mineral disorders are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to poor quality of life, high fracture risk, and increased morbidity and cardiovascular mortality. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) are frequently used to assess bone turnover, but markers such as procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (intact PINP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRAP5b), which reflect bone formation and resorption, may provide more specific insights into bone remodeling. This study aims to investigate the effects of balance and strength exercises on bone turnover markers in patients with CKD not undergoing kidney replacement therapy. This study is a post-hoc sub-analysis of the RENEXC trial, a randomized controlled exercise intervention lasting 12 months. A total of 151 CKD stage 3-5 patients were randomly assigned to either strength or balance exercise, both combined with endurance exercise. Exercise intensity was monitored using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. Bone turnover markers, including intact PINP and TRAP5b, were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Over 12 months, within-group changes in bone turnover markers were not statistically significant. In the strength group, intact PINP showed a non-significant increase and TRAP5b a slight decrease, while in the balance group intact PINP tended to decrease and TRAP5b remained stable. After adjustment for baseline values, between-group differences at 12 months were small and non-significant for both markers. Overall adjusted means were 78.7&#xa0;&#xb5;g/L for intact PINP and 1.87 U/L for TRAP5b, with no significant effects of treatment group, sex, or CKD stage. Additionally, both exercise groups showed an increase in the proportion of patients with TRAP5b values indicative of low bone turnover, suggesting a possible protective effect on bone resorption. Neither strength nor balance exercise significantly altered bone turnover markers over 12 months in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, both interventions were associated with more participants exhibiting TRAP5b values consistent with low bone turnover, indicating a potential role in mitigating bone resorption. These findings warrant further investigation into the long-term effects of exercise on bone health in CKD, with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying these responses.

    "abstract": "Dietary diversity is widely recommended to promote health, but its association with activities of daily living (ADL) in older adults needs to be clarified. To examine the association of dietary diversity score (DDS) with ADL among older Chinese adults. A total of 17,464 adults aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;65 y without disability in ADL at baseline were enrolled in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). The DDS at baseline was constructed based on 9 items of a food frequency questionnaire. Disability in ADL was defined as dependence on eating, toileting, bathing, dressing, indoor activities, and continence. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between DDS (categorized by quartile) and disability in ADL. During the mean follow-up of 5.25 y, 10,750 participants with disability in ADL were identified. In comparison with individuals in the first quartile for DDS, the adjusted HR for disability in ADL was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.96) in the second quartile, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) in the third quartile, and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.92) in the fourth quartile (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 for trend). Meat, eggs, beans, vegetables, and fruits were also associated with a lower risk of disability in ADL. Our findings suggest that a higher DDS was associated with a lower risk of disability in ADL among older Chinese adults. Greater efforts to promote a diverse diet should be targeted towards older adult for preventing disability in ADL.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves conditions for lung cancer (LC) surgery patients, but PR behavior is suboptimal. This study investigated the effect of message framing on PR behavior in this population, as this area is underexplored. A three-arm randomized controlled trial enrolled 102 patients randomly assigned to a gain-framed message (GFM) group (information emphasizing positive outcomes of PR adherence), a loss-framed message (LFM) group (information highlighting negative consequences of non-adherence to PR), or a no-framed message (NFM) group (PR with no framed messages). Data were collected at admission, the day before surgery, the day of discharge, and one month after discharge. Primary outcomes were postoperative exercise adherence and exercise self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity, dyspnea, anxiety, and depression. The baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable (P&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant time effect (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and a significant group effect (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) for exercise adherence. For exercise self-efficacy, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and anxiety, significant time effects, group effects, and interaction effects were observed (all P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). However, the interaction effect for depression was not statistically significant (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.109). Both the GFM and LFM groups demonstrated significantly better outcomes across all measures compared to the NFM group (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Furthermore, the GFM group showed significantly greater improvement than the LFM group in all outcomes (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Message frames appear to be a promising communication strategy, with GFM in particular showing potential. When combined with PR, they may have the potential to improve PR behaviors and outcomes among patients undergoing LC surgery.

However, it remains unclear whether APOE &#x3b5;4 status modulates the associations of non-genetic risk factors and dementia risk. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate this potential modulating role. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted up to June 2023. Population-based longitudinal studies were included if they reported associations of risk factors with all-cause dementia (ACD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) stratified by APOE &#x3b5;4 status. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to test stratification effects by APOE &#x3b5;4. A total of 170 studies (173 factors) were included, with 48 factors for meta-analyses. Meta-regression confirmed significant modification effect by APOE &#x3b5;4 status for nine risk factors. Stronger associations in APOE &#x3b5;4 carriers were found for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, frequent drinking, and high systolic blood pressure; in noncarriers, stronger associations were observed for light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, female sex, physical activity, diabetes, and loneliness. Diabetes specifically increased AD risk only in APOE &#x3b5;4 noncarriers. Additionally, the subgroup analyses stratified by APOE &#x3b5;4 status indicated that nine other factors may influence risk differentially between carriers and noncarriers, though the associations were not significant in meta-regression (vitamin E intake, heart failure, serum neurofilament light chain, serum testosterone, agitation, air NO<sub>2</sub> concentration, ever smoker, current smoker, and head injury). Evidence from the current investigation suggests that APOE &#x3b5;4 defines distinct etiological pathways for dementia, underscoring the promise of genotype-tailored prevention strategies.",

Identifying patterns of risk factors among adults can contribute to efforts to effectively target and prevent these chronic diseases. This study aims to examine latent classes of population risk based on behavioral and metabolic risk factors for NCDs in Cambodia. Data from 5275 respondents aged 18 and older from the 2023 Cambodian World Health Survey Plus were used for analysis. Latent class analysis identified distinct classes of individuals with similar behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Indicator variables included tobacco and alcohol use, fruit and vegetable diet, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Multinomial logistic regression was employed to predict latent class membership based on sociodemographic characteristics. Three distinct latent classes were identified: \"alcohol users with lower metabolic risk\" (37.8%), \"substance users with compounding unhealthy behaviors\" (15.0%), and \"alcohol users with higher metabolic risk\" (47.2%). Men, older adults, and individuals with lower education were more likely to be substance users with compounding unhealthy behaviors and alcohol users with higher metabolic risks. These findings highlight the need for targeted public health strategies to address the combined impact of multiple risk factors, particularly among men, older adults, and individuals with lower education levels.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety in Chinese patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), and their associations with pain intensity, sleep propensity, oral behaviors, jaw function, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). It also evaluated the likelihood of different TMD subtypes among individuals with no depression or anxiety (NC), depression alone (DA), anxiety alone (AA), and comorbid conditions (CC). Participants recruited from a dental hospital completed a survey comprising sociodemographics, the Diagnostic Criteria for TMDs (DC/TMD) Symptoms Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Oral Behaviors Checklist, Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8, and the Oral Health Impact Profile for TMDs. Clinical examinations followed the DC/TMD protocol, classifying individuals into intra-articular (IT), pain-related (PT), or combined (CT) TMDs. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, non-parametric methods, and multinomial logistic regression (&#x3b1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Among 798 participants (mean age 29.8&#xa0;years [SD 10.7]; 79.6% women), 48.0%, 10.8%, 7.9%, and 33.3% had NC, DA, AA, and CC, respectively. Significant differences were observed in pain intensity (CC/AA/DA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;NC), sleep propensity (CC/DA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;AA/NC), jaw overuse behavior (CC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;AA/NC; DA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;NC), jaw functional limitation (CC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;DA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;NC; AA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;NC), and OHRQoL (CC&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;AA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;DA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;NC). Moderate correlations were observed between jaw functional limitation and OHRQoL across groups, with additional links to pain intensity in DA and AA (r<sub>s</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43-0.54).

Activity patterns were measured by accelerometers during seven consecutive days in 1405 women between 2016 and 2023. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for BMI, age, smoking, parity, country of birth, pre-pregnancy disease, and year of participation were performed. The accelerometer could not detect light physical activity; why only moderate and vigorous physical activity were included in the analyses. Compared with women being least sedentary, women with the highest proportion of sedentary behavior had higher adjusted odds of any preeclampsia (AOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.44-7.16), with a tendency of higher odds of severe or preterm preeclampsia (AOR 9.84, 95% CI 1.05-92.66 and AOR 5.61, 95% CI 1.04-30.23, respectively). The most physically active women had lower odds of any preeclampsia (AOR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10-0.50) than the least physically active, and the odds seemed lowest for the more severe subtypes. There were no associations with other obstetric outcomes. In conclusion, sedentary behavior and physical activity in early to mid-pregnancy might affect likelihood of preeclampsia, also after adjustment of confounders such as BMI.",

However, the interplay among these factors in hypertension remains unclear. We explored this intricate relationship in young and middle-aged adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2018). We analyzed the associations between obesity indicators, including weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), fat mass index (FMI), and visceral adiposity index (VAI) and hypertension, considering mediating roles of the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and UA. We included 5,166 participants aged 18-59 years, and 1,154 (22.34%) experienced hypertension. Patients with hypertension exhibited significantly elevated SII, UA, and obesity indicators than did those without hypertension (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Weighted logistic regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between WWI, FMI, VAI, and hypertension risk, with significant dose-response and nonlinear associations. SII and UA partially mediated the association between WWI and FMI with hypertension, with UA also mediating the VAI-hypertension link. Subgroup analyses indicated that the association between WWI, FMI, VAI, and hypertension was significant in most subgroups. Our findings highlight the strong association between obesity indicators and hypertension and underscore the importance of targeting inflammation and UA levels in managing hypertension risk among young and middle-aged adults.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal morphogenesis relies on intercellular signaling. Astrocytes release metabolites, trophic, and guidance factors to promote neuronal maturation. In contrast, the mechanisms by which astrocytes could limit and stabilize neuronal connectivity remain less explored. Here, we find cortical astrocytes to express and release S100A6, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein ('calcyclin'). Simultaneously, the majority of cortical neurons expressed calcyclin-binding protein (CaCyBp), a bona fide binding partner for S100A6. In neurons, CaCyBp maintains the unfolded protein response pathway, thereby controlling proteostasis. When released, S100A6 inhibits CaCyBp-mediated signaling, thus slowing protein turnover, and, consequently, neuritogenesis. In the cerebral cortex of male mice, S100A6-CaCyBp signaling during gestation is sensitive to the mother's nutritional status, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid intake. Thus, a member of the S100 protein family acts as an astroglia-derived morphogen, whose action on neurons is modulated by environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream enactment behaviors and rapid eye movement sleep without atonia (RWA). It is associated with a significantly increased risk of conversion to neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, the clinical diagnosis and management of RBD remain insufficiently standardized, while early identification and intervention are crucial for improving disease outcomes. To raise awareness and attention among clinicians towards RBD and provide guidance for its standardized management, experts in the fields of neurology and sleep medicine in China formulated the guideline for diagnosis and treatment of RBD. This guideline was established in accordance with the current evidence-based medicine to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of RBD in China. Based on systematic literature reviews and international grading systems for recommendations and evidence levels, the guideline systematically summarized the epidemiology, etiology, classification, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, auxiliary examinations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, as well as prognosis and outcomes of RBD. A total of five recommendations were formulated in the field of treatment. The guideline aimed to provide scientific and standardized guidance for the clinical management of RBD. &#x5feb;&#x901f;&#x773c;&#x52a8;&#x7761;&#x7720;&#x671f;&#x884c;&#x4e3a;&#x969c;&#x788d;&#xff08;RBD&#xff09;&#x662f;&#x4e00;&#x79cd;&#x4ee5;&#x5feb;&#x901f;&#x773c;&#x52a8;&#x7761;&#x7720;&#x671f;&#x51fa;&#x73b0;&#x68a6;&#x5883;&#x6f14;&#x7ece;&#x884c;&#x4e3a;&#x548c;&#x808c;&#x5f20;&#x529b;&#x5931;&#x5f1b;&#x7f13;&#x4e3a;&#x7279;&#x5f81;&#x7684;&#x5f02;&#x6001;&#x7761;&#x7720;&#xff0c;&#x6709;&#x6781;&#x5927;&#x53ef;&#x80fd;&#x53d1;&#x5c55;&#x4e3a;&#x795e;&#x7ecf;&#x7cfb;&#x7edf;&#x9000;&#x884c;&#x6027;&#x75be;&#x75c5;&#x7684;&#x98ce;&#x9669;&#x3002;&#x76ee;&#x524d;RBD&#x7684;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x8bca;&#x7597;&#x5c1a;&#x5b58;&#x5728;&#x89c4;&#x8303;&#x5316;&#x4e0d;&#x8db3;&#x7684;&#x95ee;&#x9898;&#xff0c;&#x800c;&#x65e9;&#x671f;&#x8bc6;&#x522b;&#x4e0e;&#x5e72;&#x9884;&#x5bf9;&#x6539;&#x5584;&#x75be;&#x75c5;&#x8f6c;&#x5f52;&#x81f3;&#x5173;&#x91cd;&#x8981;&#x3002;&#x4e3a;&#x63d0;&#x9ad8;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x533b;&#x5e08;&#x5bf9;RBD&#x7684;&#x8ba4;&#x8bc6;&#x4e0e;&#x8bca;&#x7597;&#x89c4;&#x8303;&#x6027;&#xff0c;&#x56fd;&#x5185;&#x795e;&#x7ecf;&#x75c5;&#x5b66;&#x53ca;&#x7761;&#x7720;&#x533b;&#x5b66;&#x9886;&#x57df;&#x4e13;&#x5bb6;&#x57fa;&#x4e8e;&#x5faa;&#x8bc1;&#x533b;&#x5b66;&#x8bc1;&#x636e;&#xff0c;&#x5728;&#x7cfb;&#x7edf;&#x6027;&#x6587;&#x732e;&#x68c0;&#x7d22;&#x7684;&#x57fa;&#x7840;&#x4e0a;&#xff0c;&#x53c2;&#x8003;&#x56fd;&#x9645;&#x6307;&#x5357;&#x6807;&#x51c6;&#x5316;&#x8bc4;&#x7ea7;&#x7cfb;&#x7edf;&#x5bf9;&#x63a8;&#x8350;&#x7b49;&#x7ea7;&#x548c;&#x8bc1;&#x636e;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x8fdb;&#x884c;&#x5206;&#x7c7b;&#xff0c;&#x5236;&#x8ba2;&#x300a;&#x5feb;&#x901f;&#x773c;&#x52a8;&#x7761;&#x7720;&#x671f;&#x884c;&#x4e3a;&#x969c;&#x788d;&#x8bca;&#x65ad;&#x548c;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x6307;&#x5357;&#x300b;&#x3002;&#x672c;&#x6307;&#x5357;&#x5bf9;RBD&#x7684;&#x6d41;&#x884c;&#x75c5;&#x5b66;&#x3001;&#x75c5;&#x56e0;&#x53ca;&#x5206;&#x7c7b;&#x3001;&#x53d1;&#x75c5;&#x673a;&#x5236;&#x3001;&#x4e34;&#x5e8a;&#x8868;&#x73b0;&#x3001;&#x8bc4;&#x4f30;&#x53ca;&#x8f85;&#x52a9;&#x68c0;&#x67e5;&#x3001;&#x8bca;&#x65ad;&#x53ca;&#x9274;&#x522b;&#x8bca;&#x65ad;&#x3001;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x53ca;&#x9884;&#x540e;&#x8f6c;&#x5f52;&#x7b49;&#x5185;&#x5bb9;&#x8fdb;&#x884c;&#x4e86;&#x7cfb;&#x7edf;&#x9610;&#x8ff0;&#xff0c;&#x5728;&#x6cbb;&#x7597;&#x65b9;&#x9762;&#x5f62;&#x6210;5&#x6761;&#x63a8;&#x8350;&#x610f;&#x89c1;&#xff0c;&#x4ee5;&#x671f;&#x4e3a;RBD&#x7684;&#x89c4;&#x8303;&#x5316;&#x8bca;&#x7597;&#x63d0;&#x4f9b;&#x79d1;&#x5b66;&#x6307;&#x5bfc;&#x3002;.",

A review of related literature was performed to examine interpersonal communication, interpersonal communication skills, interpersonal communication and a proactive stance in conflict resolution, and the development of communication skills in children in a puzzled world. The study noted that children should be allowed and guided appropriately to express themselves clearly and assertively; parents should follow up on their children regularly and should build on teachers' efforts at home. Parents should also allow teachers to do their job of teaching, counselling, and rewarding positively (praise, commend) or negatively (punish) based on the circumstances; teachers should use a child-centered approach in order to make the class lively, interesting, and engaging for children. In addition, they should show empathy and try to be close to the children as much as possible to curb the actions of the loquacious ones and help the shy or withdrawn children to come out of their shells as they prepare for the task ahead in a challenging but essential milieu as they mature and are integrated into the system. The government should implement better incentives and policies to encourage teachers to contribute to the growth and positive development of the child through remuneration and promotion that are timely and in line with their quota.",

This research was designed as a semi-experimental design defined as &quot;Pretest-Post-test Control Group Model&quot;. The study group of the research consisted of 120 students studying in the Selçuklar secondary school affiliated to the Mersin Provincial Directorate of National Education in the 2018-2019 academic year. &quot;Communication Skills Evaluation Scale&quot;, &quot;Empathy Scale for Children and Adolescents&quot; and &quot;Determination of Conflict Resolution Behavior Scale&quot; were used as data collection tools. The program was applied to the experimental group for 8 consecutive weeks with 1 60-70-minute session per week at 11 o'clock on Mondays in the conference hall of the school. Independent sample t-test and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data of this research. As a result of the research, it was found that program increased the students' level of communication, empathy and conflict resolution skills in the experimental group. In line with the results obtained, suggestions such as systematic and planned implementation of the developed program at certain hours as part of the curriculum within the scope of the psychological counseling and guidance services were made.",

The gratitude youth feel after different types of bystander action may depend on which behaviors are most congruent with personal beliefs. Face and honor cultures provide social norms for expectations and interpretations of behavior, including how to act during and after interpersonal conflict. In the current study, 264 ethnically diverse adolescents (African, European, Mexican-American, and Indigenous) from the Pacific Northwest described past instances when they experienced an act of peer-instigated aggression and subsequent bystander action. We examined how face and honor endorsements predicted victims' gratitude following three different types of bystander action (calm, avenge, and reconcile). Face endorsement predicted higher gratitude for being calmed, whereas honor endorsement predicted higher gratitude for being avenged. Bystander efforts to reconcile conflict elicited the most gratitude but were not related to social norm endorsement. Our findings shed light on the association between social norm endorsement and victimized youths' gratitude for their intervening peers' bystander actions.",

According to our literature review, these three variables are positively related to one another. Therefore, the authors created a model that treats parent-child interaction as an exogenous variable, gratitude as a mediating variable, and prosocial behaviors as endogenous variables. To test this model, the authors administered the Parent-Child Interaction Scale, the Gratitude Scale, and the Prosocial Behavior Scale, which have good validity and reliability, to a total of 987 fifth- and sixth-grade students in Kaohsiung. In regard of gender, there were 521 males, occupying 52.8%; 466 females, occupying 47.2%. In respect with grade level, there were 482 grade-5 students, occupying 48.8%; 505 grade-6 students, occupying 51.2%. Based on an analysis of data using structural equation modeling (SEM), we reached the following conclusions: 1 There was a significant positive correlation between father-child and mother-child interactions; 2. There was a significant positive correlation between parent-child interaction, gratitude, and prosocial behavior; 3. Gratitude mediated the relationship between parent-child interaction and prosocial behavior.",

Within the scope of the research, it is aimed to test these hypotheses. Method: Relational survey model was used in the study. The study group of the research consisted of 324 4th grade primary school students studying in Diyarbakir province during the 2018-2019 academic year and designated through a random sampling method. &quot;Conflict Resolution Skills Scale,&quot; developed by Gurdogan Bayir, &quot;KA-SI Empathetic Tendency Scale for Children,&quot; developed by Kaya and Siyez and &quot;Respectful Behavior Scale&quot; developed by Erken were used as data collection tools in the research. The data obtained were analysed by Structural Equation Model and Bootstrap analysis. Findings: Within the framework of the findings obtained, predictably, it was found that there is a significant relationship between empathetic tendency and conflict resolution skills and that empathetic tendency can explain conflict resolution skills by 36%. As also suggested in the research hypotheses, in addition to the existence of a relationship between an empathetic tendency and conflict resolution skills through a model in which respectful behaviour is a significant partial mediator, empathetic tendency can explain conflict resolution skills at a level of 54%. Implications for Research and Practice: In future research, it should be investigated, which skill, value, or demographic information etc. other than empathetic tendency and respectful behaviour may help explain the baffling variance ratio.",

    "abstract": "Empathy plays a key role in maintaining close relationships and promoting prosocial conflict resolution. However, research has not addressed the potential emotional cost of adolescents' high empathy, particularly when relationships are characterized by more frequent conflict. The present 6-year longitudinal study (N = 467) investigated whether conflict with parents predicted emotion dysregulation more strongly for high-empathy adolescents than for lower-empathy adolescents. Emotion dysregulation was operationalized at both the experiential level, using mood diary data collected for 3 weeks each year, and at the dispositional level, using annual self-report measures. In line with predictions, we found that more frequent adolescent-parent conflict predicted greater day-to-day mood variability and dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation for high-empathy adolescents, but not for average- and low-empathy adolescents. Mood variability and difficulties in emotion regulation, in turn, also predicted increased conflict with parents. These links were not moderated by empathy. Moreover, our research allowed for a novel investigation of the interplay between experiential and dispositional emotion dysregulation. Day-to-day mood variability predicted increasing dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation over time, which suggests that experiential dysregulation becomes consolidated into dispositional difficulties in emotion regulation. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that, for high-empathy adolescents, conflict was a driver of this dysregulation consolidation process. Finally, emotion dysregulation played a role in overtime conflict maintenance for high-empathy adolescents. This suggests that, through emotion dysregulation, high empathy may paradoxically also contribute to maintaining negative adolescent-parent interactions. Our research indicates that high empathy comes at a cost when adolescent-parent relationships are characterized by greater negativity.",

Experiment 2 (N = 129, 4- to 6-year-olds) indicated that grateful emotions increased the likelihood that the children would help not only the benefactor but also a stranger. Experiment 3 (N = 133, 3- to 6-year-olds) showed that gratitude motivated preschoolers' sharing behavior with the benefactor. Children's theory-of-mind and their understanding of the benefactor's intention mediated the relationship between children's age, gratitude, and prosociality.",

Multiple regression analysis was used for the analysis of the data. According to results of the study, it was found that empathic tendency levels, self-regulation skills and self-efficacy perceptions of adolescents predicted their conflict resolution skills significantly. When the relative importance order of the predictor variables on the conflict resolution skills is examined, it is seen that the empathy variable is the most efficient predicting variable followed by self-regulation and self-efficacy.

This study examined the tendency of message connections and how gratitude messages prompted replies. To elucidate their connections, exponential random graph models (ERGMs) were used. A post-event questionnaire to evaluate gratitude experiences was also administered. Results revealed that 77.3% of the 172 connected messages from 123 students involved gratitude. When the post-event questionnaire results were examined using an ERGM, the score effects on increasing message connections were found not to be significant. The most prominent indication was a higher level of significant propensities to make mutual connections. The homophily of the message content was found to have a significant propensity to increase connections. The ERGM results and a review of messages revealed that students expressed gratitude for being both benefactors and beneficiaries of gratitude messages, which confirmed their prosocial behaviour.",

    "abstract": "How does empathic physiology unfold as a dynamic process, and which aspect of empathy predicts children's kindness? In response to empathy induction videos, 4- to 6-year-old children (N = 180) showed an average pattern of dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) change characterized by early RSA suppression, followed by RSA recovery, and modest subsequent suppression during positive resolution of the empathic event. Children's capacity for this pattern of flexible RSA change was associated with their subjective empathic feelings, which were concurrently associated with more sympathetic and prosocial responses to others. Conversely, only children's dynamic RSA change longitudinally predicted prosocial behavior 2 years later. These findings have implications for understanding the dynamic and multifaceted nature of empathy, and its relation with prosocial development.",

The sample consisted of 321 children (160 boys, M[subscript age at Time 2] = 12.29, SD = 1.02) from Times 2, 3, and 4 of the Flourishing Families Project. Adolescents reported on financial entitlement at Time 2, on sympathy at Time 3, and on gratitude, prosocial behavior, and aggression at Time 4. Structural equation model tests showed that adolescents' financial entitlement was negatively associated with sympathy, which in turn was positively associated with gratitude and prosocial behavior. Adolescents' financial entitlement was also directly and positively associated with aggression. Discussion focuses on implications for understanding the consequences of financial entitlement on adolescent behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that personal factors serve as mediators in the link between self-compassion and subjective well-being (SWB). However, these studies have neglected the possibility that online prosocial behavior (OPB) may serve as a mediator in the link between self-compassion and SWB. Based on the PERMA theory of well-being and the protective-protective model, the current study examined whether OPB would mediate the association between self-compassion and individual SWB, and whether gratitude would moderate the association between self-compassion and OPB. A valid sample of 1488 college students (M[subscript age] = 19.84; SD = 1.61) filled out questionnaires regarding demographics, self-compassion, OPB, gratitude, and SWB. Results showed that, after controlling for gender, age, daily online time, and social desirability, OPB mediated the association between self-compassion and individual SWB, and gratitude strengthened the positive association between self-compassion and OPB. These findings reveal that high self-compassionate and grateful people can enhance their subjective well-being through behaving prosocially online.",

Cluster analysis classified 440 fathers, 440 mothers, and 125 tutors into 4 clusters, based on self-reports of their conflict resolution styles. Adolescents exposed to Cluster 1 (inconsistency and withdrawal) reported lower self-control than those exposed to Cluster 2 (inconsistency and dominance), who reported more ability to deal with stress, effective task performance, and positive self-concept and self-esteem, indicating that dominance at the school only was related to positive results. Lower perceived stress, positive self-concept and self-esteem, empathy, and social connectedness were reported by those adolescents exposed to Cluster 3 (consistency in negotiation), whereas those exposed to Cluster 4 (consistency in dominance) exhibited the worst profile in all the measures. In conclusion, the cross-contextual variability in conflict resolution styles was associated with different opportunities for positive development in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately perceive one's own bodily signals, such as the heartbeat, plays a vital role in physical and mental health. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this ability, termed interoception, are not fully understood. Converging evidence suggests that cardiac rhythms are linked to frontal brain activity, particularly oscillations in the delta (0.5 - 4&#x2009;Hz) band, but their causal relationship remained elusive. Here, we identified a frontal network of delta oscillations that was anticorrelated with both heartbeat perception and heartbeat-evoked brain responses. Using amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS), a method to enhance or suppress brain oscillations in a phase-specific manner, we investigated whether frontal delta oscillations are causally linked to heartbeat perception. We found that enhancement of delta phase synchrony suppressed heartbeat detection accuracy, while suppression of delta phase synchrony enhanced heartbeat detection accuracy. These findings suggest that frontal delta oscillations play a significant role in heartbeat perception, paving the way for causal investigations of interoception and potential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors with permanent stomas may commonly suffer from social withdrawal and subsequently experience loneliness. However, the relationship between social withdrawal and loneliness may vary depending on the individual's&#xa0;psychological flexibility based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) theory. The present study thus examined the association between social withdrawal and loneliness by focusing on the potential moderating roles of psychological flexibility among CRC survivors with permanent stomas. A cross-sectional sample of 289 CRC survivors with permanent stomas completed the social withdrawal subscales, the stoma acceptance and valuable actions scale, and the 6-item revised UCLA Loneliness scale. Moderation analysis using the PROCESS macro in SPSS was conducted to examine the moderating effects of psychological flexibility and its two components, stoma acceptance and valuable actions. The results indicated that social withdrawal was positively associated with loneliness (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.423, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The moderating analyses showed that psychological flexibility significantly moderated the association of social withdrawal with loneliness (interaction term&#x2009;= -&#x2009;0.017, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). Further exploratory analyses found that the moderating effect of valuable actions was significant (interaction term&#x2009;= -&#x2009;0.028, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), while the stoma acceptance was not. Psychological flexibility, as well as valuable actions, may serve as a protective factor in the potential effects of social withdrawal on loneliness among CRC survivors with permanent stomas.",

    "abstract": "Learning difficulties in children can have a variety of causes, often interconnected. Factors such as emotional problems (anxiety, stress), communication difficulties, inadequate teaching methodologies, health problems, lack of family support, and even genetic and prenatal factors can contribute to these difficulties. There are several ways to tackle the problem, mainly the use of active methodologies involving technology tools is one of them. In this direction, to help alleviate these problems, this article analyzes the possible use of educational robotics as a support tool to help children with learning difficulties in the teaching-learning process. We seek to answer our main research question, which is to identify if and how educational robotics can help the development of these students' skills and abilities. To do that, we first conducted a systematic review of the literature on the subject, from which we performed an in-depth analysis, including several issues, not just those related to learning difficulties. From this initial stage, we found that there are few studies that address this topic and several open questions. The main gap observed is that many students with learning difficulties are present in schools, but most of them do not participate in robotic activities. Also, in some cases, they show no interest, as will be discussed, on the basis of strictly related works. Given the novelty of the subject and the existence of gaps, we conducted an investigation using a qualitative-quantitative research methodology, using a questionnaire as a data collection tool. The analysis of the results indicates an increase in the use of robotics in education for students with learning difficulties and, above all, that these students benefit from its use. Thus, this study contributes with a step forward in demonstrating that Educational Robotics can help students with learning difficulties.",

Here, we compare the well-being of pet owners and non-pet owners and investigate the roles of loneliness, living arrangement, and pet attachment in explaining the effects of pet ownership. The results indicated that pet owners experienced lower loneliness than non-pet owners when living alone, such that loneliness mediated the effects of pet ownership on well-being. Furthermore, the interpersonal substitution aspect of pet attachment was prominently associated to well-being, with loneliness completely mediating its negative effects. This study contributes to a more contextual and attachment-focused understanding of how pet ownership could implicate loneliness and well-being. It emphasizes the need to foster healthy pet attachments and to balance pet companionship with human social interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cirrhosis is a healing response to persistent liver injury, and the widely used clinical indicators of cirrhosis severity are limited. The lactate/albumin ratio (LAR) can be used as a marker of early prognosis in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical significance of LAR for predicting the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and to provide new insights. Patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis were extracted from the MIMIC- IV database. The cox regression models were used to analyze the association between the LAR and all-cause mortality in cirrhosis patients. We analyzed potential nonlinear relationships between LAR and outcome indicators using restricted cubic spline cures (RCS). The predictive power was investigated using receiver operating characteristic(ROC) analysis. Additionally, we calculated the incremental effect of the LAR index. The study included a total of 2402 patients with cirrhosis. According to the Kaplan-Meier curves and cox regression analysis indicated that the risk of 28-day, 90-day, 180-day, 1-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the highest quartile of LAR. The result of the multivariable RCS model showed the LAR index have a linear relationship (p for nonlinear&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.115) with 28d all-cause mortality. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of LAR (66.44% [95% CI 0.64-68.88%]) was superior to lactate (63.51% [95% CI 61.01-66.01%]) and albumin (64.46% [95% CI 62.01-66.92%]). The predictive ability of scoring tools for 28d mortality was significantly improved after considering either the LAR index using integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI). The LAR index can serve as a significant predictor for all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis.",

    "abstract": "Hospital-initiated opioid analgesics that extend beyond discharge can lead to long-term use and adverse outcomes. Despite a growing understanding of opioid-related harms, there is a lack of published protocols for structured deprescribing of hospital-initiated opioids in Europe. Opioid stewardship initiatives, which encompass coordinated approaches to optimize prescribing practices and reduce long-term use, require deprescribing frameworks that extend beyond medication discontinuation to include patient communication and systematic care coordination. We aimed to develop an actionable opioid deprescribing framework that builds on trialed reduction protocols with patient-centered determinants for systematic implementation in tertiary care. We conducted a multi-level consensus study to bridge evidence, clinician expertise, and patient perspectives. Initial framework development included focus group discussions with multidisciplinary clinicians (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5). The framework was validated for our institution via a two-round Delphi survey across six medical specialties (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11). An opioid reduction calculator was developed in Python, incorporating clinical parameters to determine reduction trajectories for prespecified starting and end doses. Final refinement included interviews with patients receiving opioid therapy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) to optimize understandability of the reduction plan as a patient handout and for developing a patient pamphlet on opioids with patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13). The framework identified four critical domains for successful deprescribing of hospital-initiated opioids: interventional reduction strategies, patient-specific physiological variables, environmental enablers, and procedural elements. Reduction strategies categorized patients into chronic and new users, incorporating grace periods for dose stabilization, with particular attention given to patients exhibiting pain catastrophizing behavior and frailty. Environmental and procedural factors included shared responsibility and interdisciplinarity, ensuring that follow-up is facilitated by a coordinated care team. These findings were operationalized into the reduction calculator, proposing initial individualized reduction plans (10-25%) based on key patient-specific variables with built-in stabilization periods. Delphi validation achieved full consensus (87.8% first-round agreement; 100% final consensus) on all framework components. Patient involvement refined the handout to improve understandability and actionability, and yielded comprehensive information on opioids. We developed an actionable opioid deprescribing framework that bridges published evidence with patient-centered care for our institution, providing other healthcare institutions with a practical blueprint for their own implementation. Our multi-level consensus identified critical patient-specific and environmental determinants, and established individualized reduction protocols, addressing a critical gap in transitional care while facilitating safe opioid deprescribing practices.",

    "abstract": "The effects of environmental and climatic factors on the prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) in Changchun, China, have not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between meteorological factors, air pollution, and the number of AR outpatient visits in Changchun, and determine whether different temperature and humidity conditions would influence the effect of air pollution on the number of AR outpatient visits. Generalized additive and distributional lag non-linear models were used to assess the relationship between meteorological factors, air pollution, and the number of AR outpatient visits. Using different temperatures and relative humidities, we determined whether the effects of air pollution on the number of AR outpatients would change under different meteorological conditions. In total, 15,338 AR outpatient records were collected during the study period. Except for O<sub>3</sub>, other pollutants were positively correlated with AR outpatient visits overall. Results found that each 10&#xa0;&#xb5;g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>, and per 1&#xa0;&#xb5;g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the daily average concentration of SO<sub>2</sub>, the number of AR outpatient visits increased by 1.45% (95% CI: 0.23%-2.70%), 1.03% (95% CI: 0.06%-2.00%), 3.98% (95% CI: 1.25%-6.78%), and 1.68% (95% CI: 0.78%-2.59%), respectively. Air pollution has immediate and cumulative lagged effects on these visits. There was a non-linear correlation between meteorological factors and the number of AR outpatient visits. Low and high temperatures, low RH and low barometric pressure may affect the number of AR outpatient visits. Compared with the minimum risk of each respective meteorological factor, their Relative Risk (RR) values are 1.65(95%CI: 0.80-3.40), 1.05(95%CI: 1.03-1.08), 1.53(95%CI: 1.21-1.93), and 1.75(95%CI: 1.25-2.43), respectively. The impact of low temperature is more pronounced. The hazardous effect of extreme meteorological factors was stronger in the &lt;&#x2009;15 years age group. In addition, The effect of air pollution on the number of AR outpatient visits increased at low temperature (&lt;&#x2009;33.3% percentile) and low relative humidity (&lt;&#x2009;33.3% percentile). Increased air pollution and changes in meteorological factors are associated with an increased risk of AR outpatient visits. Children&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;15 years old are the most vulnerable to extreme weather factors. Low temperature and low RH could positively modify the effects of air pollution on AR outpatient visits.",

    "abstract": "Double negative (DN) B cells, defined as CD27-IgD- B cells, are increased in older healthy individuals as well as in patients with certain diseases. However, the relationship between DN B cells and Sj&#xf6;gren's disease (SjD) in newly diagnosed patients remains unclear. Seventy SjD patients and thirty-six healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. Peripheral blood B cell subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry. The percentage and absolute count of DN B cells were significantly lower in SjD patients compared to HCs (p = 0.000 and p = 0.007, respectively). Patients with medium to high disease activity, defined by an EULAR Sj&#xf6;gren Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score &#x2265; 5, exhibited lower DN B cell levels compared to those with low disease activity (ESSDAI score &lt; 5, p = 0.029 and p = 0.000, respectively). Moreover, lower DN B cell percentages were associated with glandular involvement (p = 0.039) and neutropenia (p = 0.034). Regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between DN B cells and SjD disease activity (B=-0.240, 95% CI:-0.468 to -0.013, p = 0.039). Additionally, DN B cells showed weak negative correlation with the percentage of total B cells (r=-0.266, p = 0.026). This study demonstrates that DN B cells are decreased in SjD, particularly in patients with glandular involvement and high disease activity. Moreover, the inverse correlation between DN B cells and total B cells suggested that DN B cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of SjD.",

    "abstract": "Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) may affect skeletal muscles through the muscle-liver axis, subsequently leading to sarcopenia. Our study aims to explore the unclear genetic relationships between PBC and sarcopenia. We investigated the shared genetic architecture of PBC and sarcopenia using advanced statistical genetics methods and genome-wide association summary data. We employed global and local genetic correlation to gain potential shared biological mechanisms. We identified risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functionally annotated genomic multi-markers by conducting the unified test for molecular signatures. Finally, we prioritized fine-mapping analysis to emphasize the significant causal genes. Our study has identified significant genomic associations, suggesting the complex genetic interactions between PBC and sarcopenia. At the genomic level, we identified 17 unique bivariate regions among 88 trait pairs. In the bivariate locus analysis, we identified a total of 136 pleiotropic loci, with ASTN1, TGFB2, and ACP1 being particularly prominent. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted putative pleiotropic genomic regions, including brain and spleen. Furthermore, the identified pleiotropic loci demonstrate strong signal transduction in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. Our findings highlight shared genetic links and causal relationships between PBC and sarcopenia, offering novel insights into their genetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between C-peptide levels, specifically 180-min postprandial C-peptide levels, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This cross-sectional study involved 1545 participants divided into two groups: one with diabetic retinopathy (742 individuals) and one without (803 individuals). To assess the connection between C-peptide levels and DR, multivariate logistic regression and Spearman correlation analysis were performed, including subgroup analyses to ensure robustness of the results. Compared with individuals without DR, individuals with DR had significantly lower postprandial C-peptide levels. Additionally, these postprandial C-peptide levels were inversely correlated with Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and duration of diabetes but positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride levels. Logistic regression analysis revealed a strong inverse association between postprandial 180-min C-peptide levels and the risk of DR. Specifically, higher C-peptide levels were linked to a lower prevalence of DR, a relationship that persisted even after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Furthermore, when different subgroups were analyzed based on sex, age, BMI, and HbA1c levels, individuals without DR consistently had higher C-peptide levels than those with DR. A stratified analysis further confirmed that the inverse relationship between C-peptide levels and DR risk was consistent across most subgroups. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that higher postprandial 180-min C-peptide levels are inversely related to the risk of diabetic retinopathy, implying that elevated C-peptide levels could offer some protection against the retinal damage associated with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide, leaving many survivors with chronic neurological deficits that restrict their daily activities. Telerehabilitation offers an opportunity to improve access to care, reducing travel burdens and fostering ongoing therapy in diverse settings. Speech and language telerehabilitation specifically benefits those with communication disorders such as dysarthria. However, widespread reliance on manual, paper-based documentation and subjective evaluations remains a significant challenge for remote speech and language therapy. To address this, we identified the specific requirements of various stakeholders and employed a user-centred design approach to develop a digital tool that integrates note-taking, time measurement, and audio/video recording within a single interface. By prioritizing the needs of speech-language pathologists (SLPs), researchers, and IT specialists, the resulting prototype streamlines common tasks, enhances data consistency, and delivers high usability. In testing, SLPs reported a reduction in assessment times from 50 to 35&#xa0;min, while the average System Usability Scale score exceeded industry benchmarks, indicating strong acceptance. By enabling automated scoring, data export, and potential interoperability with healthcare systems, this tool foster more comprehensive patient monitoring. Future iterations will incorporate a secure backend and support for additional assessments, potentially transforming remote speech and language therapy.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are both devastating, incurable, neurodegenerative diseases that are largely considered to be of unknown etiology. While the diseases have some similarities, they are not typically considered to be closely related. They have different pathological markers and different prognoses. Additionally, MS (but not ALS) is considered an autoimmune disease. Furthermore, MS has long been noted to have a strong north-south gradient in its distribution whereas only recently has awareness grown of such a gradient in ALS. The study here will show, however, that if the distribution of ALS and MS are analyzed using mortality data, they are extremely correlated even after controlling for gender, race and latitude. This relationship was not previously identified in part because of a Simpson's paradox in the data: strong correlations that are obvious in the data when they are separated by gender are obscured when the data are pooled across gender. The presence of a strong association in the distributions of ALS and MS suggests there is a connection between the two diseases that is not yet understood. That connection may prove valuable in helping to illuminate what causes the diseases, and whether and how they can be prevented and treated.",

    "abstract": "Biological phenotypes emerge from complex interactions across molecular layers. Yet, data-driven approaches to infer these regulatory networks have primarily focused on single-omic studies, overlooking inter-layer regulatory relationships. To address these limitations, we developed MINIE, a computational method that integrates multi-omic data from bulk metabolomics and single-cell transcriptomics through a Bayesian regression approach that explicitly models the timescale separation between molecular layers. We validate the method on both simulated datasets and experimental Parkinson's disease data. MINIE exhibits accurate and robust predictive performance across and within omic layers, including curated multi-omic networks and the lac operon. Benchmarking demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while ranking among the top performers in comprehensive single-cell network inference analysis. The integration of regulatory dynamics across molecular layers and temporal scales provides a powerful tool for comprehensive multi-omic network inference.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease which may significantly impact health status. To reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, pharmacological treatment should be complemented by addressing extrapulmonary traits and lifestyle- and psychosocial factors, such as physical deconditioning, decrease in muscle mass, smoking or depression. Treatment of these non-pharmacological traits is commonly conducted in a primary care setting and often requires multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). To provide complementary care, high quality interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is required. Therefore, our aim was to develop an IPC model for COPD patients treated in primary care. To achieve our aims, we used co-creation sessions (CCS), a recognised method within the participatory action research (PAR) approach. Co-creation, characterised by collaboration and a bottom-up strategy, has repeatedly shown to be suitable for developing care improvements. We recruited two independent groups of stakeholders to participate in six CCS in parallel. They were purposefully sampled and included patients and HCPs from both primary and secondary/tertiary care. Given the considerable overlap in results between the two independent teams, we developed a joint model which is ready to be pilot tested. Our model is based on current and local work methods and can be implemented in existing local contexts and structures. We noted some differences between the teams: the choice of the routing and timing of IPC commencement, and the choice for the communication platform. Using the PAR approach and co-creation, we developed an actionable IPC model in primary care for COPD patients.",

A corpus of 5,621 articles from seven newspapers, collected via the Italian National Institute of Health's daily press review, was analyzed with SketchEngine using corpus-assisted discourse methods. Quantitative analysis showed a rise in vaccine-related coverage at the end of 2020 and throughout 2021. Core terms such as vaccino (vaccine) and vaccinazione (vaccination) were frequent, while occasional use of synonyms like serum and antidote risked creating confusion. Qualitative analysis revealed instances of \"false balance,\" where anti-vaccine views were presented alongside pro-vaccine perspectives as if equally supported by evidence. These findings suggest that even authoritative outlets reproduced reporting practices that may undermine public understanding of vaccines. Greater awareness of such practices, and closer collaboration between health professionals and communication experts, could help improve the quality of health information in the media.",

Canadian Community Health Survey participants aged 18 years or older during the 2015, 2016, and 2019 cycles. Weighted summary statistics and a partial proportional odds regression model were used to assess relationships between patient-level social and health determinants and wait times for primary care (ranging from same-day appointments to waits of 1 month or longer). A weighted sample of 9,380,662 participants across the 3 survey cycles was used. Participants had a mean age of 49.7 years (standard deviation=17.5), 55.7% were female, and 74.7% were white. Approximately 57.4% of participants waited less than a week for care while 11.0% waited 1 month or longer. Factors associated with higher odds of waiting at least 1 month for a consultation were attaining only a high school diploma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23) compared with having postsecondary education; identifying as Asian (aOR=1.42, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.67) or Black (aOR=1.57, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.13) compared with identifying as white; having \"excellent\" self-reported health status (aOR=1.10, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.19) compared with \"good\" self-reported health; lacking a regular primary care provider (aOR=1.47, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.71) compared with having a regular provider; or being classified as having multimorbidity (aOR=1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.21) compared with having no chronic condition. Wait times for primary care were found to be associated with patient-level social and health determinants including race, education level, absence or presence of a regular health care provider, self-reported health status, and multimorbidity. Future research could investigate health system determinants of wait times to inform specific policy measures designed to reduce disparities in access to care.",

We evaluate the first WPBL pilot undertaken in paediatrics in Myanmar. This cohort study assesses the implementation of WPBL among 85 postgraduate doctors from five medical universities in Myanmar. In 2018, Myanmar's paediatric medical leaders had outlined an ambitious plan to modernise learning at the postgraduate level through a multi-skilled <i>in-situ</i> approach. Supported by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH, UK), a co-designed pilot programme of WPBL was trialled in a structured way. This pilot was Myanmar-led, with UK experts providing support to Myanmar supervisors and to the 85 paediatric postgraduate doctors whom they mentored. Progress was documented through a co-designed, standardised 'portfolio of learning' that included well-established WPBL strategies. The quality of supervisor feedback in the portfolio to postgraduates was scored by independent assessors, as was the degree of completion of the portfolio, to determine adherence to the WPBL pilot objectives. Insights into the broader changes in practice resulting from the pilot were ascertained through a narrative commentary of moderated focus groups of both supervisors and postgraduates. 'Clinical' WPBL topics were more often chosen than 'softer' skill areas, for example, communication and leadership. Focus groups identified the benefits of a structured approach to learning, particularly in areas of weaker clinical performance. There were regional variations in how WPBL was delivered, with disparities between medical schools located in the north and those in the south, challenging WPBL standardisation. Evidence on the impact of formalising WPBL in low-resource settings is minimal. This pilot demonstrates that setting up a WPBL programme is feasible in a low-resource setting, but it also presents challenges.",

    "abstract": "Medication reconciliation is a critical process for ensuring patient safety by preventing medication errors, especially at hospital admission. Despite its importance, compliance with this process in our internal medicine ward was alarmingly low, with an initial baseline of only 4% compliance in January 2019. This prompted the initiation of a quality improvement (QI) project aimed at improving adherence to the medication reconciliation process. A team-based approach was implemented, including junior doctors, nurses, pharmacists and the hospital's information technology team. The plan-do-study-act (PDSA) methodology was used to design, test and implement interventions. Key interventions included educational sessions for junior doctors, integration of pharmacy systems for easy access, daily reminders via a WhatsApp group, and reinforcement of the process by senior residents. Data collection was standardised, tracking patient demographics, reconciliation times and team responsibilities. Compliance was monitored over a 4-month intervention period. At the start of the intervention, medication reconciliation compliance was at 4%. Initial progress was slow, requiring frequent reminders and educational sessions. However, by the end of the first month, compliance had reached 77%, and by the end of the 4-month period, it improved to 96%, surpassing the target of 90%. This improvement was sustained with a compliance rate above 90% for 6&#x2009;months following the intervention. The use of the PDSA methodology significantly improved medication reconciliation compliance, achieving a 96% adherence rate. Engaging healthcare staff through education, clear communication and a team-based approach was key to overcoming barriers and ensuring sustainable improvements. This model can be applied to other QI projects aimed at enhancing patient safety and reducing preventable harm.",

    "abstract": "To investigate how the Qassim Health Cluster (QHC) implemented population health management (PHM) in tandem with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 and to pinpoint the main issues and lessons gained from this implementation. This research used a descriptive population study design and was conducted between November and December 2024. We collected data using a mixed-method approach, gathering qualitative data from 11 PHM implementers and secondary quantitative data from 102,946 healthcare service users. Qassim Health Cluster's PHM implementation team established a regional 5-year strategic plan to follow the national PHM framework, utilizing data-based decision-making to implement the strategy. The major challenges identified include the lack of availability of relevant comprehensive PHM policy documents and guidelines, ineffective and delayed technical support, and resistance to change among stakeholders. Lobbying and effective communication were 2 useful strategies for PHM implementation. In the coming decades, the QHC's PHM implementation will drastically shift healthcare practices toward a more sustainable healthcare system that aligns with Vision 2030. To guarantee the successful operation of PHM in the QHC and other health clusters, more advocacy for institutional support, technical assistance, adequate funding, and sponsorship is required.",

    "abstract": "In 1999, the inaugural editorial of the Journal of Medical Internet Research underscored the imperative to evaluate the patient-physician relationship amid the advent of internet-driven medical practices. Even at that nascent stage, views diverged sharply. Some anticipated that novel communication technologies would enhance closeness between physicians and patients. Others feared these technologies signaled a degradation of interpersonal connections and a dehumanization of health care experiences. Reflecting on years of developments, we consider this an opportune moment to reassess transformations in patient-physician interactions, in which notions of distance and proximity are redefined in some unexpected ways. In this paper, we intend to focus on teleconsultation and tele-expertise, the two most commonly used services in our field, dermatology. To navigate these changes, a sociological perspective inspired by Isaac Joseph's theoretical framework has been adopted. Joseph posits that service-oriented relationships depend on 3 core skill sets among participants: technical, civic, and contract management. In medicine, these translate to the clinical, social, and contractual aspects of care. Telemedicine programs introduce significant shifts and adaptations across these dimensions. A primary challenge in telemedicine is the absence of comprehensive sensory information, a crucial component of traditional medical assessments. This article discusses how such technical alterations impact medical practice and necessitate a redistribution of roles. Telemedicine is not merely about adapting existing technical skills; it also demands new competencies, often referred to as \"invisible work,\" to make telemedicine work. Beyond its clinical dimensions, the therapeutic relationship is inherently social. It involves sending signals that confer respect and recognition of the other as a person. A common concern is that telemedicine might lead to reification, that is, turning human patients into objects to serve researchers and physicians, and although extensive literature suggests that physicians develop various strategies to mitigate this, other studies indicate an increased risk of reification in constrained contexts. Contract management skills consist of the parties involved reaching an agreement on the purpose of the service-related relationship and its practical applications. In telemedicine, this may involve reminding the patient that not everything can be done remotely. Through this analysis of the three components of the service relationship as defined by Joseph, we have highlighted the profound changes affecting the physician-patient relationship in the context of telemedicine. Dehumanization is an inherent risk in any medical health care partnership, regardless of whether patient care is delivered face-to-face or at a distance. While some studies have clearly documented the dehumanizing tendency of some telemedicine practices, telemedicine itself is neither reifying nor dehumanizing. The organizational arrangements, the context of work activities, the modalities of use in situ and the types of technological devices used are all contributing factors in defining the level of humanization in remote health care interactions.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of digital health technologies, particularly within the Web 3.0 framework, has underscored eHealth literacy (eHL) as a critical competency for patients engaging with digital health care platforms. Patients in sustained hospital stays, often in vulnerable conditions, face unique challenges in using eHealth tools effectively. However, existing eHL assessment tools are insufficient to address the intricate and dynamic demands of contemporary health care systems, especially for individuals under continuous hospital care. This study aimed to develop the Adult Inpatient eHealth Literacy Scale (AIPeHLS), a comprehensive, multidimensional tool grounded in the Lily Model, to evaluate eHL among adult inpatients within the context of digital health care innovations. The development of the AIPeHLS followed a systematic, multiphase process. Initial item pool generation was informed by a literature review and then refined using the Delphi method, resulting in a preliminary set of 53 items spanning 6 dimensions of the Lily Model. The scale was refined through a pilot survey among 100 individuals requiring inpatient care, followed by item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Validation was achieved via a cross-sectional study with 532 participants, using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify the scale structure, alongside evaluations of convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and content validity. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach &#x3b1;, Omega, and split-half reliability. The finalized AIPeHLS comprised 44 items across 6 dimensions: traditional literacy, information literacy, media literacy, health literacy, computer literacy, and scientific literacy, reflecting the skills necessary in the Web 3.0 context. Both EFA and CFA confirmed the 6-factor structure, demonstrating acceptable model fit indices (&#x3c7;&#xb2;=1974.654 (df=887), root mean square error of approximation=0.048, comparative fit index=0.957, normed fit index=0.925, and incremental fit index=0.957). The scale exhibited robust content validity, convergent and discriminant validity, criterion-related validity, and high internal consistency, with a Cronbach &#x3b1; of .965, Omega coefficient of 0.962, and a split-half reliability of 0.791 for the entire scale. The 44-item AIPeHLS was found to be a reliable and valid instrument for assessing eHL in adult inpatients in the evolving Web 3.0 context. Its comprehensive framework and strong psychometric properties make it an effective tool for health care providers to understand patients' digital health competencies and tailor interventions accordingly. For researchers, our findings provided opportunities to explore the relationship between eHL and health outcomes, while offering valuable insights into the development of more effective eHealth interventions and policies.",

    "abstract": "Science doctoral students can experience negative interactions with faculty mentors and internalize these experiences, potentially leading to self-blame and undermining their research self-efficacy. Helping students perceive these interactions adaptively may protect their research self-efficacy and maintain functional mentoring relationships. We conducted a preregistered, longitudinal field experiment of a novel perspective-getting intervention combined with attribution retraining to help students avoid self-blame and preserve research self-efficacy. Science doctoral students (<i>n</i> = 155) were randomly assigned to read about mentor perspectives on negative interactions (i.e., Perspective-getting Condition) or about mentoring with no mentor perspective (i.e., control condition). Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no main effects of the intervention on students' self-blame or research self-efficacy. However, for students with lower preintervention mentorship relationship satisfaction, the intervention preserved research self-efficacy six months later. This study provides evidence that perspective-getting may be protective for students who are most in need of relationship intervention.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The growing volume of high-throughput single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data sets-particularly those related to cancer-offers immense opportunities as well as analytical challenges for effective data analysis and interpretation. Large language models (LLMs), pretrained on vast data sets and capable of various biomedical tasks, offer a promising solution. This review explores the application of LLMs in cancer research from both cellular and pathologic perspectives, aiming to showcase their potential in advancing precision oncology. We systematically review current LLMs in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomic, and histology image data, emphasizing their relevance to cancer biology and translational research. A total of 24 LLMs, published or in preprint between 2022 and 2025, were selected for review. In single-cell transcriptomics, LLMs have primarily been used for cell type annotation, batch integration, and drug-response prediction. In spatial transcriptomics, LLMs support multislide and multimodal spatial data integration, gene expression imputation, niche and region label prediction, spatial domain identification, cell-cell communication inference, and marker gene detection. In computational pathology, LLMs have been applied to cancer subtyping, detection of rare malignancies, genomic mutation prediction, image segmentation, as well as cross-modal retrieval. Despite these advances, many models remain underoptimized for cancer-specific applications, highlighting the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and scalable adaptation strategies. LLMs have the potential to significantly advance cancer research by providing scalable and effective tools for analyzing and interpreting single-cell, spatial transcriptomic, and pathology data. Future efforts should prioritize tailoring these models to cancer-specific contexts to enhance their utility in uncovering disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and informing therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Although obesity is recognized as a risk factor of migraine chronification, its longitudinal impact on migraine onset remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between obesity and the risk of developing migraine in a longitudinal setting. We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Individuals aged 20-39 years who underwent health examinations between 2009 and 2012 were enrolled, excluding those with a history of migraine, missing data, or a migraine diagnosis within the first year. Participants were followed to the end of 2018. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized into 5 groups and waist circumference (WC) into 6 levels. Outcome was the first migraine claim (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code G43). We evaluated the associations of BMI and WC with the risk of migraine using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models. Interaction analyses were conducted based on demographic and lifestyle factors. Among 6,106,560 individuals included (mean age: 30.6 &#xb1; 4.98 years; 39% female), the risk of migraine increased with increasing BMI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.001 [95% CI 0.991-1.010], 1.047 [95% CI 1.040-1.055], 1.087 [95% CI 1.079-1.094], and 1.121 [95% CI 1.106-1.136] for underweight, overweight, stage 1 obesity, and stage 2 obesity, respectively, compared with normal BMI) and WC (aHR 0.913 [95% CI 0.906-0.921], 0.969 [95% CI 0.960-0.978], 1.022 [95% CI 1.010-1.034], 1.048 [95% CI 1.032-1.065], and 1.048 [95% CI 1.030-1.067] for levels 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, compared with level 3). This dose-dependent relationship remained significant for WC after adjusting for BMI, but not vice versa. A stronger association between abdominal obesity and migraine risk was observed in younger individuals (&lt;30 years) (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.0181), nonsmokers (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.0341), and heavy drinkers (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.0143). Obesity was associated with an increased risk of migraine in young adults in a dose-dependent manner, with WC demonstrating a more robust independent association than BMI. Owing to the limitations of claims data, our study needs cautious interpretation and further validation in studies with detailed clinical information.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex and multifaceted disease, with biological causes distributed across tissues and bodily systems and influenced by psychological and social factors. A major aim of pain research is to find better ways to measure signals associated with chronic pain and thus predict, track, and treat pain conditions. Emerging biological measures related to the metabolic, immune, and nervous systems hold promise for identifying the physiology underlying pain and developing new treatments. Developing such measures will require multimodal datasets from large samples in combination with methodological advances. The Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program serves as a model for such an effort, and its data will provide investigational opportunities for years to come. Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures is collecting multiomics, psychosocial, functional, and neuroimaging data from 2800 individuals before and after thoracic or knee replacement surgery. In addition to evaluating the prognostic value of previously identified biomarkers for predicting the transition to chronic pain, A2CPS will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to link these multiple data types and identify multimodal biosignatures of future pain. Open sharing of large datasets like that of the A2CPS, and models derived from them, will accelerate discovery and allow researchers to model brain, metabolic, and immune relationships relevant for multiple facets of health.",

    "abstract": "Family relationships dynamically affect pain outcomes. However, less is known about African American family relationships and chronic pain incidence and persistence. Using theoretically driven group characterizations of family emotional climate (FEC; Strained, Supportive, and Disengaged) across multiple relationship types, we conducted latent class analyses in 2 nationally representative data sets (Midlife in the United States [MIDUS]; Health Retirement Study [HRS]) aimed to identify a more ecologically valid model of family relationships and determine how the identified FEC groups, separately and concurrently, connect to chronic pain incidence and persistence for aging African Americans. For the family-only models in MIDUS and HRS, using logistic regression, Strained FEC compared with Supportive FEC increased the risk of pain incidence (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06) in MIDUS and the risk of pain persistence (OR = 2.14) in HRS. The next models extended to include parent-child relationships in HRS identified 4 FEC groups (eg, Strained Family and Parent-Child, Supportive and Strained Family and Parent-Child, Supportive Family and Parent-Child, and Disengaged Family and Parent-Child FEC). Again, using logistic regression, we identified a greater risk of pain incidence was linked to Strained Family and Parent-Child FEC (OR = 1.36) and Supportive and Strained Family and Parent-Child FEC (OR = 1.22), although not Disengaged Family and Parent-Child FEC (OR = 0.71). Strained Family and Parent-Child FEC also related to greater risk of pain persistence (OR = 1.89) compared with Supportive Family and Parent-Child FEC. These findings suggest utilization of a multidimensional modeling of family relationships to contextualize pain outcomes for aging African Americans.",

    "abstract": "Emoji are a universal visual language widely used in digital communication; yet, their representation of medical concepts remains limited. The introduction of medical emojis, such as the anatomical heart and lungs, highlights their potential for health care communication, but significant gaps persist. This study aims to systematically analyze the representation of medical concepts in emoji by mapping Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to Unicode emojis, identifying gaps in medical emoji representation, and proposing areas for future emoji development. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the sentence transformer model. Digital resources, including the MeSH thesaurus and Unicode emoji set version 15.0 (Unicode Consortium), were used. Embeddings for 2077 MeSH terms and 3055 emojis were generated, and cosine similarity scores were calculated to evaluate the semantic alignment between MeSH terms and emoji descriptions. A threshold of 0.7 was set to indicate a strong semantic match. The analysis revealed significant variations in emoji representation across medical categories. \"Geographicals\" had the highest match rate (33.33%), whereas \"Anatomy\" showed only 7.94% matches, with 13 of 163 terms exceeding the similarity threshold. Categories such as \"Disciplines and Occupations,\" \"Information Science,\" and \"Psychiatry and Psychology\" had no matches (0%), highlighting notable gaps. The findings underscore substantial disparities in medical emoji representation, particularly for internal organs, mental health, and specialized disciplines. Limited availability of representative emoji may hinder effective health care communication, especially in digital health contexts. This study emphasizes the potential of artificial intelligence to design emojis that address these gaps and improve inclusivity. Significant gaps in medical emoji representation across various domains were identified. Future efforts should prioritize underrepresented medical categories and leverage artificial intelligence-driven approaches for emoji development to enhance health care communication and accessibility.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the mediating effect of psychological distress and wellbeing in the association between anti-mattering and irritability among a sample of Lebanese adolescents-a topic that remains largely underexplored in adolescent mental health research. A cross-sectional study was conducted during November 2023 and included 763 adolescents currently residing in Lebanon (mean age 16.08&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.74 years, 37.6% males and 62.4% females) recruited from all Lebanese governorates using a snowball sampling technique. Data were collected via an online questionnaire and analyzed using the PROCESS Macro for mediation analysis. The findings indicated that both psychological distress (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.39, BootSE&#x2009;=&#x2009;.04, 95% CI [.33,.46]) and wellbeing (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;.07, BootSE&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02, 95% CI [.03,.12]) partially mediated the relationship between anti-mattering and irritability. Adolescents with higher levels of anti-mattering reported greater distress and reduced wellbeing, both of which were associated with increased irritability. Our results highlight the psychological relevance of anti-mattering in adolescence and suggest that addressing feelings of insignificance may play a key role in managing emotional dysregulation. Mental health practitioners and educators should consider developing culturally sensitive interventions that target feelings of anti-mattering, enhance wellbeing, and reduce psychological distress. School-based programs promoting emotional support and social inclusion may prove especially beneficial. Future studies should investigate these associations longitudinally and across varied cultural contexts to better inform prevention and intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Research exploring the connection between pet ownership and mental health has expanded substantially in recent years, yet scientific evidence remains inconclusive. Existing studies have oversimplified this relationship by focusing primarily on pet ownership itself, without accounting for crucial factors such as species of the pet, or important relationship dynamics such as owner-pet attachment orientations. This study sought to investigate whether the relationship between owner-pet attachment and owner mental health could be better understood through the lens of owner-perceived pet compatibility, perceived pet welfare, and pet behavioral issues. These under researched aspects are believed to play crucial roles in shaping owner-pet relationships and owner mental well-being. This study surveyed emerging adults (ages 18-26) who owned dogs and/or cats from the United Kingdom (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;600) who self-identified as experiencing difficulties with anxiety and/or low mood, of whom some reported clinical diagnoses. Our findings revealed that dog owners exhibited more secure pet attachments than cat owners. Anxious attachment was associated with poorer mental health among dog owners, while avoidant attachment was associated with better mental health in both dog and cat owners. Insecure attachment related to poorer perceived pet quality of life, increased reports of pet behavioral problems, and poorer owner-pet compatibility, regardless of pet species. Additionally, poorer welfare and more behavioral problems were associated with poorer mental health for dog owners; these findings were not replicated for cat owners. Notably, a dog's mental state (such as appearing depressed), as well as fear and anxiety, mediated the relationship between owner-pet attachment and owner mental health. Owner-dog compatibility, particularly in the affection domain, positively mediated the relationship between anxious attachment and poorer mental health, while negatively mediating the relationship between avoidant attachment and better mental health. These findings suggest that a simplistic view of pet ownership fails to capture the complexity of the factors that shape the mental health of pet owners and underscores the need to consider important owner-pet factors to fully understand how the human-pet relationship can impact the well-being of both people and their pets.",

    "abstract": "Humans start new friendships and social connections throughout their lives and such relationships foster mental and physical well-being. While friendship initiation may depend on alignment of subtle and complex personal variables, here we investigated whether it also depends on basic features of social environments. In a preregistered online study (n = 783) using a novel social-affiliation seeking paradigm, we found people were more likely to send friend requests as the density of friendship opportunities decreased and frequency of success increased. Further, we found task-related measures, like overall friend requests, were correlated with mental health dimensions like social thriving and anhedonia. Next, in an ultra-high-field fMRI study (n = 24), we found that both fundamental features of social environments--opportunity density and frequency of success--affected neural activity across a network of regions linked to foraging including dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and anterior insula. Thus, humans consider the background statistics of an environment while making social decisions and these decisions are linked to activity in cortico-subcortical circuits mediating the influence of environmental statistics on other aspects of behavior. Moreover, individual differences in how environmental features influence social behavior are associated with variation in mental health dimensions, offering key insights into interindividual variability in social functioning.",

    "abstract": "Customer tolerance behavior actively sustains harmonious host-guest relationships and strengthens homestay reputations. Drawing on social cognition theory and attribution theory, this study investigates how interpersonal interaction shapes customer tolerance behavior in homestay services and examines whether stay duration moderates these effects. Using survey data from 322 homestay customers collected via the Credamo platform, we test the mechanisms linking interaction quality, motivational attribution, and tolerance. Our findings reveal that interpersonal interaction significantly enhances customer tolerance behavior. Specifically, interaction encourages customers to attribute altruistic rather than self-interested motives to hosts, and these attributions mediate the effect of interaction on tolerance. Although stay duration amplifies the direct effect of interaction on tolerance, it does not significantly moderate the link between interaction and motivational attribution. These findings clarify the psychological processes driving tolerance in homestay contexts and highlight the importance of cultivating positive host-guest interactions to build service resilience.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 participants including patients, family members, doctors, and nurses. This study examined how families alleviate communication burdens and navigate power dynamics between patients and physicians. The findings revealed that families gather, interpret, and translate medical information, often acting as intermediaries, owing to limited consultation times and complex medical terminology. They provide emotional, financial, and integrated care; influence treatment decisions; and ensure compliance. However, the study also identified limitations, such as disagreements among family members, information concealment, and the potential undermining of patient autonomy. This study underscores the need for nuanced approaches to family involvement that prioritize patient-centered care and respect individual preferences.",

    "abstract": "Host factor-mediated post-translational modification of coronavirus proteins has been demonstrated as an important strategy for regulating viral proliferation. Identification of key host genes involved in this process may provide potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we used the complementary reverse genetic system to determine that UBXN7 promotes SARS-CoV-2 viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) production and also promotes the replication of other human coronaviruses. However, UBXN7 does not affect the replication of VSV and RSV, suggesting that it may be a potential pan human coronaviral anti-infection target. Our results revealed that UBXN7 did not affect the viral invasion of cells, but instead hijacked viral genome assembly by interacting with SARS-CoV-2&#x2009;N protein via its UBX domain. Further data indicated that UBXN7 inhibits K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of SARS-CoV-2&#x2009;N protein, leading to N protein accumulation. Moreover, K257 of N protein was identified as specific target site of UBXN7 which are critical for viral replication. These findings reveal a novel relationship between host gene-mediated protein ubiquitylation and viral genome assembly, providing new strategies for potential pan-coronavirus drug design.",

    "abstract": "The factors impacting individual-level heat mitigation behaviors (e.g., seeking shade, staying cool, wearing loose-fitting clothes) during extreme heat events among adults in the United States are poorly understood. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used extensively to explore health promoting behaviors; we explored the application of the HBM constructs to understand heat mitigation behaviors among U.S. adults. Online panel data from the Household Emergency Preparedness Survey was collected in May 2024 to explore knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors related to extreme heat mitigation among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. An outcome variable assessing likeliness to engage in heat mitigation behaviors was developed by dichotomizing a sum of responses to questions asking about likelihood to engage in different mitigation behaviors; scores were split on the median value to classify those \"more likely\" versus \"less likely\" to engage in mitigation behaviors. Descriptive statistics were used to explore HBM construct responses among our sample; logistic regression models examined whether perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, self-efficacy, and cues to action were associated with more likelihood to engage in heat mitigation behaviors, after controlling for age, sex, income, race/ethnicity, education, and political affiliation. We included 6095 responses to the online panel survey in our analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model including all HBM constructs and adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics found that higher degrees of perceived benefits (OR=1.30, 95% CI:1.22-1.39), self-efficacy (OR=3.69, 95% CI: 3.26-4.10), and cues to action (OR=1.48, 95% CI:1.38-1.60) were positively associated with being more likely to engage in heat mitigation behaviors. Results from our analyses suggest that communication strategies, guidelines, and interventions which incorporate cues to action, as well as those focused on improving perceived benefits and self-efficacy can be most effective in improving heat mitigation behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Rural tourism is pivotal in addressing the unidirectional urban-to-rural flow of resources, such as labor migration. However, the interaction between rural tourism and rural revitalization in developed regions remains poorly understood. This study establishes an evaluation index system for rural revitalization and rural tourism, examining their interrelationship. Using the entropy method and coupling coordination degree model, we assess the development levels and coordination degrees of these aspects in Jiangsu Province from 2012 to 2023. Furthermore, the geographical detector model is utilized to pinpoint the primary drivers influencing this coordination. The findings are: (1) Both rural revitalization and tourism exhibit significant growth, with southern Jiangsu outperforming the north; (2) The coupling coordination between these systems has strengthened, indicating a profound symbiotic relationship; (3) Spatial distribution differences are notable, with the coupling coordination degree D value in southern Jiangsu being 26.4% higher than in the north. This disparity is primarily attributable to the wider urban-rural income gap and greater fiscal investment in southern Jiangsu. Notably, the traditional \"resource dependence theory\" appears ineffective in Jiangsu, as the density of rural tourism resources is relatively low. Accordingly, the study proposes differentiated policy recommendations: northern Jiangsu should focus on talent attraction and the integration of culture and tourism, while southern Jiangsu should explore mechanisms to facilitate the two-way flow of urban-rural elements. This research provides a theoretical framework for coordinating \"policy-market\" dynamics in the rural transformation of developed regions.",

    "abstract": "The role played by communication technology in daily life is gradually increasing. However, there are problems such as complex types of signals, huge amount of data and noise interference, and the recognition accuracy of existing modulation classification methods is low. Therefore, the study proposes a signal automatic modulation classification model based on fixed K-mean algorithm and denoising autoencoder. The model uses fixed K-mean algorithm for feature classification and optimizes median filtering algorithm using dynamic thresholding. The classifier is used to improve the recognition accuracy of specific signals, and long short-term memory and data random corruption denoising are used to optimize the autoencoder. The experiments indicated that the signal classification accuracy of the model were 17.6% and 16.8% higher than the other two models, respectively. The computational complexity of the improved model decreased dramatically, but the average classification accuracy was only 1.6% lower than that before the improvement. The communication overhead and training efficiency were better than the other models, and the number of parameters of the model was 1/2 of that of the pre-improvement model. The memory occupancy and running time were reduced by 335KB and 33ms, respectively. Compared to the other two models, the model's average classification accuracy at a signal-to-noise ratio of 0 was 18.4% and 19.7% higher, respectively. As a result, the improved model effectively increases signal recognition accuracy, enhances model robustness, and significantly reduces computational complexity while ensuring real-time signal processing for communication computing.",

The exact etiology is not completely understood, but several factors are suggested to be effective. This study aimed to assess the relationship of some possible related factors with CM. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 335 female students with severe cyclic Mastalgia. They were selected by multi-stage sampling method from dormitories of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran-Iran. Data was collected using an online questionnaire including the Beck's Depression Inventory, the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, the Fisher Body-Image Questionnaire, the Cardiff Breast Pain Chart (NDBP), and a socio-demographic questionnaire. The data were analyzed by SPSS 29 and using Spearman, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and multiple linear regression tests. The average age of the participants was 25.61&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.92 years with a Cardiff score of 31.76&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.33 (mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD).

Beck's depression score had a significant positive correlation with the severity of CM (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035). A significant positive correlation was also found between smoking and the severity of CM (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.035, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.115). There were significant positive correlations between the severity of CM with the duration of the menstrual cycle (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and menstruation (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). There were no significant relationships between the severity of CM with other variables. The multiple linear regression test demonstrated that depression (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014) and duration of the menstrual cycle (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) are predictors of severity of CM. Depression and duration of menstrual cycle are potential predictors of the severity of CM. Promotion of Women's menstrual and mental health as well as prevention of high-risk habits such as smoking should be considered for the severity of CM and improving the quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of ChatGPT has sparked extensive academic discourse across multiple fields. This study focuses on such discourse within the social sciences by examining how scholars frame and evaluate ChatGPT through research article abstracts. Drawing on 1,227 SSCI-indexed abstracts published between 30 November 2022 and 30 November 2024, we adopt a two-step natural language processing approach. First, we apply topic modeling to identify major thematic patterns in academic discussions of ChatGPT. Then, we perform sentiment analysis to examine how scholars' evaluative attitudes are discursively constructed across these thematic areas. Topic modeling reveals six key themes: artificial intelligence (AI) and technology communication, education and learning tools, user perception and adoption, ethics and academic challenges, human-technology interaction, and computational foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Sentiment analysis suggests that approximately 82.97% of abstracts express positive attitudes, particularly regarding ChatGPT's research potential and pedagogical utility, while around 9.78% reflect more cautious or negative views, often focusing on issues such as academic integrity and misinformation. These sentiment patterns appear to vary across thematic areas, with user adoption and education-related topics showing greater positivity, while ethics-oriented discussions exhibit relatively more critical perspectives. By analyzing academic discourse as reflected in research article abstracts, this study contributes a discourse-level perspective on how ChatGPT is framed, endorsed, and critically examined in the social sciences. It offers a data-driven complement to existing conceptual and survey-based investigations and draws attention to both the thematic and evaluative tendencies shaping scholarly narratives around generative AI.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a significant global health burden, with its prevalence markedly increasing in the elderly. This multicenter, non-controlled, prospective study was conducted in 16 Spanish community pharmacies to assess the feasibility of identifying potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) in patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients over 60 years old with a body mass index between 19 and 35&#x2009;kg/m2, who were taking at least one nephrotoxic medication or a drug requiring dose adjustment based on renal function, were recruited. A point-of-care (POC) test for creatinine using the StatSensor Xpress&#xae; analyzer was performed for those lacking an eGFR measurement in the previous three months, with eGFR calculated via the CKD-EPI formula. Of the 670 patients recruited (mean age 72.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.3 years; 49.9% female), 455 had an eGFR&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;60&#x2009;ml/min/1.73 m2, while 215 had values below this threshold. The medication of these latter patients was reviewed, and in 90 of them (41.9%) a potentially inappropriate prescription was identified, leading to their referral to their primary care physician. Of the total sample, 13.4% of the patients had at least one PIP. Changes were requested for 9.0% of the medications, and these were implemented in 3.4%. The proportion of PIPs increased with CKD severity, with higher intervention rates observed in advanced stages. These findings highlight the potential of community pharmacies to contribute to early CKD risk detection and medication optimization, emphasizing the need for enhanced direct communication channels between pharmacists and physicians to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Health anxiety among adolescents is understudied yet concerning. Health-related internet use (HRIU) is a common coping strategy, but disconcerting content may heighten, rather than mitigate, the health anxiety. While research has been conducted, within-person evidence for long-term fluctuations is lacking. Furthermore, adolescents with different base-level (initial) health anxiety may react differently to health-related content, making the effect dependent on health anxiety level compared to others. This study focused on the longitudinal relationship between HRIU and health anxiety on the within-person level in adolescents. We also considered their initial health anxiety, comparing adolescents with low, medium, and high base-level health anxiety. We analyzed data from 2500 Czech adolescents, aged 11-16 years (mean 13.43, SD 1.69 years; 1250/2500, 50% girls in Wave 1). Health anxiety was measured by the affective subscale of the Multidimensional Inventory of Hypochondriacal Traits, and HRIU was captured by 6 items reflecting health-related behaviors (eg, reading articles or watching videos with health-related content). The level of health anxiety in Wave 1 also served as a grouping factor. The data were collected in 3 waves, 6 months apart from June 2021 to June 2022, and analyzed using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model, chosen for its ability to separate within- and between-person effects. On the between-person level, adolescents with higher base-level health anxiety were more frequent health-related internet users (&#x3b2;=.52; P&lt;.001). On the within-person level, change in health anxiety did not predict change in HRIU, or vice versa, for those with high base-level health anxiety. In contrast, for adolescents with medium health anxiety, change in HRIU positively predicted health anxiety with large effects across all waves (&#x3b2;=.16; P=.03 from Wave 1 to Wave 2; &#x3b2;=.18; P=.01 from Wave 2 to Wave 3), and increase in health anxiety affected HRIU from Wave 2 to Wave 3 (&#x3b2;=.15; P=.03). For adolescents with low base-level health anxiety, change in their HRIU had large positive effect on changes in health anxiety from Wave 1 to Wave 2 (&#x3b2;=.17; P&lt;.001), and health anxiety positively affected HRIU with medium effect from Wave 2 to Wave 3 (&#x3b2;=.11; P=.03). Adolescents with lower, rather than high, health anxiety are susceptible to the negative long-term effects of HRIU. For adolescents with high health anxiety, HRIU neither worsens nor relieves health anxiety over time, suggesting that counselors should recommend other coping strategies besides HRIU. Adolescents with medium to low health anxiety should be guided toward mindful HRIU to prevent increased health anxiety after HRIU. This includes fostering eHealth literacy (eg, recognizing personally irrelevant information and awareness of sensationalism in media) and coping mechanisms (eg, time or topic limits, or intentional rather than compulsive searching).",

    "abstract": "Donation-based prosocial interventions involve someone receiving a free health service and then distributing or donating to support health services for others; examples within the HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) literature include secondary distribution of HIV self-tests, secondary syringe exchange, and pay it forward for STI testing. These interventions answer research and policy recommendations to incorporate prosocial behaviors into HIV/STI services. To describe motivations, facilitators, and barriers of donation-based interventions in HIV and STI research using data from qualitative studies. In this systematic review, 5 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus) and references were searched up to January 23, 2024, for qualitative studies of donation-based interventions. Thematic synthesis was used to summarize findings, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Studies Checklist was used to assess risk of bias among studies, and GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence From Reviews of Qualitative Research) was used to assess confidence in review findings. Of 374 studies screened, 27 were included, which included 1543 participants, assessing secondary distribution of HIV self-tests (15 studies), secondary syringe exchange among people who inject drugs (10 studies), and pay it forward for STI testing (2 studies). Studies were from low-income (5 studies), middle-income (13 studies), and high-income (12 studies) countries. Givers who distributed health services were motivated by a selfless concern to benefit others (20 studies, moderate confidence) and by the cultivation of a prosocial identity (20 studies, moderate confidence). Social proximity between givers and recipients facilitated distribution (22 studies, moderate confidence), allowing for recipient-tailored strategies to introduce the service, strengthen peer relationships, and promote reciprocal giving. However, secondary syringe distribution could subject people who use drugs to legal harms and encourage them to provide unsupervised clinical care (7 studies, low confidence). This systematic review identified motivations, facilitators, and barriers of donation-based interventions for HIV/STI services that could enhance implementation. Donation-based interventions may foster prosocial motivation and responsibility among socially marginalized populations to increase access to HIV/STI services.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer globally and poses a considerable public health challenge; concurrently, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) represents a significant hospital-acquired infection, with a rising incidence observed among cancer patients. To examine the relationship between CDI and CRC, it will address the risk factors associated with CDI in patients with CRC, clinical outcomes, recent findings regarding the influence of CDI on CRC, and the current strategies for management. Risk factors including gut microbiota dysbiosis, surgical interventions, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, prolonged hospitalization, and antibiotic exposure elevate susceptibility to CDI in CRC patients. Additionally, CDI correlates with more complex treatment regimens and longer hospital stays in this demographic. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that the incidence of CDI may increase the risk of CRC development. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CDI in CRC patients are critical for enhancing outcomes. A comprehensive understanding of the bidirectional relationship between CDI and CRC can guide the development of management strategies for this important clinical issue.",

    "abstract": "The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are the primary protein degradative mechanisms maintaining proteostasis in neurons. However, the impact of human genetic variation on these pathways and the role of BAG3 are poorly understood, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease, where proteostatic dysfunction is a defining hallmark. We utilized a large panel of iPSCs from deeply phenotyped cohorts to interrogate genetic contributions to baseline autophagic flux and UPS activity in human neurons, and protein turnover was assessed using SILAC-based quantitative proteomics. Across this panel of neurons, we observed substantial inter-individual differences in autophagic flux, which was inversely correlated with UPS activity. This reciprocal relationship extended to tau homeostasis, where higher autophagic flux resulted in reduced accumulation of aggregated, phosphorylated tau. Proteomic analyses revealed that global protein turnover dynamics stratified based on degradation pathway activity and could predict pathway-specific substrate dependencies. Interestingly, Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), an important member of the chaperone-assisted selective autophagy pathway, emerged as a dynamically regulated autophagy chaperone, responsive to pharmacological inhibition of both the UPS and ALP. BAG3 knockout in neurons decreased autophagic flux and increased levels of high-molecular-weight phosphorylated tau. Notably, familial AD mutations and A&#x3b2; exposure induced BAG3 expression in neurons, while elevated BAG3 levels in human brain tissue were associated with higher neuropathological burden and disease progression. Our findings identify BAG3 as a key modulator of proteostasis in human neurons. Its regulation across genetic backgrounds and pathological stimuli suggests a central role in maintaining degradation activities in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.",

This review is focusing on the multifaceted role of astrocytic D-serine from synaptic transmission to cognitive processes. While this review includes the work of other groups, it is mainly based on the findings obtained in our laboratory. Drawing from two decades of research spanning from the hypothalamus to the hippocampus, we here highlight how astrocyte-derived D-serine regulates NMDAR activity, long-term synaptic plasticity, and associated memory. Our findings have revealed the dynamic control exerted by astrocytic processes onto D-serine availability within the synaptic cleft, including the impact of the astrocytic morphological plasticity, the key role played by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as the involvement of CB1 and EphB3 receptors. We also discuss how an impairment in astrocytic D-serine synthesis can affect the co-agonist availability and consequently impact cognitive functions in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. To conclude, this review highlights the role of astrocytic D-serine in astrocyte-neuron communication and higher-order brain functions.",

The research emphasizes the machine learning model's efficacy in capturing intricate mortality risk relationships and highlighting risk factors. While prior models often relied on specific cohorts or limited variables, this model, based on commonly available variables in primary care data, displays robust discrimination and calibration. Additionally, it highlights significant predictors such as age, immigration status, diagnosis age of comorbidities, number of comorbidities, and durations of comorbidities, aiding in early risk identification. The study suggests a potential for enhanced patient management and resource allocation based on mortality risk predictions for diabetic populations, showcasing the impact of machine learning in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis is a growing research focus, with glycemic variability potentially playing a critical role in the pathophysiology and severity of periodontal disease in T2DM patients. This study aims to evaluate the association between glycemic variability, inflammatory markers, and the occurrence and severity of periodontitis in patients with T2DM. A retrospective case-control study included 296 T2DM patients admitted between February 2020 and November 2023. Patients were screened based on demographic and clinical criteria, segregating into non-periodontitis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;83) and periodontitis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;213) groups. Periodontal status was categorized using American Academy of Periodontology guidelines into non-severe (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;131) and severe (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;82) groups. Glycemic variability indices including average blood glucose, coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) were measured using continuous glucose monitoring systems. Inflammatory markers, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), were quantified in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analyses included multivariate logistic regression and correlation analyses. Increased glycemic variability was significantly correlated with the presence and severity of periodontitis (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). T2DM patients with periodontitis exhibited higher levels of inflammatory markers IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-&#x3b1;. Multivariate logistic regression identified SD (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.046, 95% CI: 1.324-3.162), CV (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.054, 95% CI: 1.008-1.102), and MAGE (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.368, 95% CI: 1.097-1.706) as significant predictors for periodontitis occurrence in T2DM patients. IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1; showed strong interrelationships and correlations with glycemic indices. Glycemic variability significantly influences the occurrence and severity of periodontitis in T2DM patients. This relationship is mediated through enhanced inflammatory responses, suggesting potential pathways linking glycemic instability to periodontal deterioration. The findings underscore the importance of glycemic control in managing periodontal health in T2DM, proposing glycemic variability as a target for therapeutic interventions to mitigate the risk and progression of periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Lower extremity fractures are common orthopaedic injuries and often require surgical intervention, which has been shown to significantly impact both the physical recovery and psychological well-being of patients. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders following lower extremity injuries, understanding the relationship between postoperative weight bearing restrictions and psychiatric outcomes is important for improving patient recovery. It was hypothesized that patients with lower extremity fractures who were allowed early weight bearing postoperatively would have lower rates of new-onset psychiatric diagnoses. The TriNetX U.S Collaborative Network database was used to identify patients without prior psychiatric diagnoses who underwent either intramedullary nailing (IMN) or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for femur and/or tibial fractures. The IMN and ORIF cohorts were matched based on age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Psychiatric outcomes included depressive and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and psychotropic medication prescriptions. Outcomes were compared at early (1-7 days), intermediate (7 days-2 months), and long term (2 months-2 years) postoperative periods. After matching, 7410 patients per cohort were included (IMN n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7410; ORIF n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7410; total N&#x2009;=&#x2009;14,820). The rates of developing a new early (1-7 days) postoperative psychiatric diagnosis did not differ significantly between the IMN and ORIF cohorts. However, IMN was associated with a significantly lower rate of depressive mood disorders during the intermediate period (0.65% vs. 1.0%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02) and over the two-year follow-up (3.1% vs. 3.7%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). After two years, IMN was associated with lower opioid use disorder compared to ORIF (0.20% vs. 0.50%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.012). There were no significant differences in the rates of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or psychotropic medication prescriptions at any timepoints. Early weight-bearing facilitated by IMN may be associated with a lower incidence of depressive mood disorders compared to delayed weight-bearing with ORIF. However, overall psychiatric outcomes were similar in this study. This suggests that other factors such as pain management and rehabilitation may play a more important role in postoperative psychiatric health.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a malignant cancer. At present, platinum-based chemotherapy drugs are mainly used to treat ESCC patients. However, certain patients have developed significant resistance to cisplatin, which greatly limits the effectiveness of treatment. Hence, it is urgent to probe the mechanism of cisplatin chemotherapy resistance in ESCC. To clarify the association between AL137246.1 level and cisplatin resistance in ESCC patients, a total of 30 pairs of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ESCC tissues were collected, and 30 non-cancerous tissues were used as controls. Survival analysis was used to detect the relationship between AL137246.1 level and ESCC prognosis. Then, Eca109 and Kyse70 cells were treated with cisplatin to induce the ESCC cisplatin resistance model. For understanding the detailed molecular process involving AL137246.1 in the development of cisplatin resistance in ESCC, the binding relationship between GLI2 and ABCC1 promoter was determined by dual luciferase and ChIP assays. RIP was applied to test the interaction between AL137246.1 and GLI2. Cell viability and proliferation were detected by CCK8 and Edu assays, respectively. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The results indicated that AL137246.1 level was reduced in ESCC and indicated a poor prognosis of ESCC. AL137246.1 overexpression was associated with increased sensitivity to cisplatin in ESCC cells, which was reversed by ABCC1 upregulation. Mechanistically, GLI2 led to the transcriptional activation of ABCC1 in ESCC. In conclusion, AL137246.1 inhibited the expression of ABCC1 by binding to GLI2, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of ESCC to cisplatin. This study suggested that AL137246.1, as a potential molecular target, has important application prospects in improving the sensitivity of ESCC to cisplatin chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions play key roles in leukocyte extravasation process into the brain and have been attractive therapeutic targets for inhibiting brain inflammation using blocking (or neutralizing) antibodies. These targets include protein-protein interactions between cytokines (or chemokines) and their receptors on leukocytes and between adhesion molecules of leukocyte and brain endothelium. While a number of therapeutics against these targets are currently used in clinic for treatment of brain autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis), they are associated with side effects partly due to the off-target actions (i.e., nonspecific targets). There is a need for novel targets involved in the leukocyte extravasation process that are specific to leukocyte subsets or to individual inflammatory disorder and are amenable for drug development (i.e., druggable). We recently described the blood-brain barrier (BBB) Carta Project as a comprehensive collection of molecular \"maps\" consisting of multiple experimental omics (including RNA sequencing, proteomics, glycoproteomics, glycomics, and metabolomics) and in silico informatic analyses on a number of mammalian species from hundreds of internal, publicly available, or curated datasets. Utilizing the datasets and tools from the BBB Carta Project, we describe a methodology to identify novel \"druggable\" targets involving protein-protein interactions between activated leukocytes and brain endothelial cells using a combination of proteomics, bioinformatics, and in silico interactomics. The result is a prioritized list of protein-protein interactions in a network consisting of leukocyte-brain endothelial cell communication and contacts. These interactions can be further pursued for development of therapeutics such as neutralizing antibodies and their validation through preclinical testing. In addition to targeting brain inflammation, the method described here is applicable for peripheral inflammation and provides the opportunity to target important cell-cell interactions and communications that are more specific/selective for inflammatory disorders and improve currently available therapies.",

Both alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are significant global health burdens, and knowledge on the pathophysiology behind the development of complications to PH is crucial. Hepatic cells with compromised function, such as hepatocytes, HSCs, and SECs, are deeply involved in the hemodynamic changes, impaired degradation of vasoactive substances, production of vasodilators, immune function, and mechanosensing. PH remains the main driver of liver-related complications, but it is often measured lower than expected in MASLD, partly because of the presence of inter-sinusoidal communications.

The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of advance directives in patients of two Swiss ICUs. To contextualise how advance directives are created, interpreted and translated into clinical practice and which patient profiles influence whether and how patients choose to formulate advance directives, secondary objectives included analysing their content, clinical translation, and associated patient characteristics and outcomes. The retrospective cohort study was carried out at two tertiary Swiss ICUs.Data were collected from patients with advance directives treated in ICUs &gt;48 hours from 2020 to 2022.The primary endpoint was the prevalence of advance directives and their content regarding life-prolonging measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Of the 5242 patients included, 313 (6.0%) had advance directives. While 290/313 (92.7%) consented to life-prolonging measures other than CPR, CPR was less frequently desired (217/313 [69.3%]). 14.0% (18/129) requested CPR despite declining life-prolonging measures. Fewer women consented to life-prolonging measures and/or CPR than men, whereas prior ICU stays were associated with higher consent rates. Of 104 treatment adaptations, 53 (51.0%) aligned with advance directives, while 33/104 adaptations (31.7%) were based on presumed poor prognosis and 4/104 (3.9%) on surrogate decisions. While patients declining life-prolonging measures experienced faster treatment changes, survival and functional outcomes did not differ based on consent status. The prevalence of patients with advance directives admitted to Swiss ICUs is low, and substantial obstacles must be overcome in clinical practice.

The primary outcome was self-reported edentulism. Cognitive and structural SC were used to measure SC at the individual and community levels. The association between SC dimensions and oral health was investigated using a two-level multilevel logistic regression. Multilevel analysis revealed that low individual and community structural SC are independently associated with edentulism in China (OR 1.43; CI 1.08-1.89 and OR 1.95; CI 1.32-2.90, respectively). In South Africa, low individual cognitive SC was negatively associated with edentulism (OR 0.48; CI 0.24-0.98), while low individual structural SC was positively associated with edentulism (OR 2.34; CI 1.16-4.74). In Ghana, only participants living in middle community structural SC had higher odds of being edentulous after adjustment for all potential confounders (OR 1.78; CI 0.71-2.96). In Mexico and India, no association was found between any dimensions of SC and oral health. The dimensions of SC and its relationship to edentulism differed across the five LMICs. Our study highlights the importance of considering contextual factors when analyzing the relationship between SC and oral health. Further research is required to understand how SC influences oral health in LMICs.",

    "abstract": "For people with visual snow, the visual field is covered in faint flickering specks. Visual snow remains poorly understood and lacks effective treatments. The snow is likely produced by spontaneous (non-stimulus driven) activity in the visual system, but the specific neural mechanisms are not known. We hypothesized that the activity producing visual snow is present early in the visual pathways. Here, we tested whether it reaches motion selective areas, including V5/MT, using the motion aftereffect (MAE). Eleven participants with visual snow syndrome (VSS) and 12 non-snow controls adapted to high contrast drifting gratings on the left and right sides of a central fixation point, moving in opposite directions. After adaptation, participants with VSS viewed their visual snow on a blank screen and pressed a button when the motion visible in the visual snow had no coherent direction. The duration of the adapter gratings varied across trials (1.6-45 seconds). In a control condition, we presented a stationary square wave pattern during the test period to confirm that participants with VSS experienced a typical MAE for external stimuli. Following adaptation, most participants with visual snow reported that it moved in the opposite direction of the adapting gratings (10/11), as expected for the MAE. Longer adapter durations resulted in longer-lasting illusions and this relationship was linear on a log-log axis, consistent with the MAE literature. Visual snow is susceptible to the MAE, suggesting that the neural activity producing visual snow reaches motion selective neurons involved in perceiving the MAE, which are believed to include V5/MT. If visual snow arises before area V5/MT, our findings suggest this activity is propagated forward through the visual pathways. Pinpointing the neural origins of visual snow may facilitate the development of novel treatment approaches targeting specific visual brain areas or networks.",

    "abstract": "BMI has been strongly associated with poor outcomes in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients, but no previous studies have examined its role in pain inhibition response. This study examines the influence of high BMI on the pain inhibition response and clinical severity of FMS. This pooled cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from nine clinical trials involving 521 adult female FMS patients included the largest mechanistic FMS sample to date. Pain inhibition responses (conditioned pain modulation, CPM) were assessed using a computer-based thermode. Clinical assessments included numeric pain scales and Beck's Depression Inventory. Unadjusted and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the influence of BMI on FMS symptoms using generalised linear models. Interaction terms for BMI and CPM were also tested. Non-linear effects of BMI were assessed with piecewise-linear models. A high body mass index (BMI) significantly correlated with a weakened CPM response and increased severity of pain and depression symptoms. The relationship between BMI and pain inhibition was distinctly non-linear, with detrimental effects becoming prominent beyond a BMI of 24&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, marking a critical slope change point. Moreover, patients with a higher BMI did not benefit from pain inhibition on pain and depression scores, unlike their normal-weight counterparts, suggesting a disruption in the endogenous pain modulation mechanisms. The study confirms that high BMI is detrimental to the clinical profile of FMS patients, adversely affecting pain inhibition and contributing to the severity of pain and depression, suggesting that weight management could be an integral component of FMS treatment. This study uniquely explores the relationship between BMI and pain inhibition response in fibromyalgia patients, revealing a non-linear association and highlighting BMI's role as a moderator of CPM. The findings emphasise that obesity disrupts endogenous pain regulation, leading to more severe pain and depression symptoms. This underscores the potential for weight management in FMS treatment and supports developing personalised interventions considering obesity status.",

    "abstract": "Spaced retrieval practice harnesses two well-studied phenomena: the spacing effect, where spacing out practice over several sessions leads to a gain in retention compared to massed practice in one session; and the testing effect, where material that is tested is better retained than material that is restudied. This meta-analysis investigates if, and under what circumstances, spaced and retrieval practice can benefit mathematics learning. We found a robust small to medium effect of spaced versus massed practice overall (g = 0.28, 27 studies, 53 effect sizes). Those studies can be split into two subsets based on their experimental design, where material was either taught in isolation (10 studies, 27 effect sizes) or as part of a course (17 studies, 26 effect sizes). We found a larger, yet less robust, effect for the isolated learning (g = 0.43) than for course-embedded (g = 0.24). Our search also revealed seven studies, 32 effect sizes, which manipulated testing versus restudy. The weighted mean effect of testing versus restudy was g = 0.18. However, the 95% confidence interval crossed zero, suggesting the testing effect is not robust. Overall, our results suggest that spaced practice can improve mathematics learning for material in isolation and within a course. However, the effect may be smaller than in other domains. Additionally, the current literature does not provide conclusive evidence for a consistent effect of retrieval practice for mathematics learning, possibly due to the smaller number of studies available.",

    "abstract": "Background: Undergraduate STEM instructors want to help students learn and retain knowledge for their future courses and careers. One promising evidence-based technique that is thought to increase long-term memory is spaced retrieval practice, or repeated testing over time. The beneficial effect of spacing has repeatedly been demonstrated in the laboratory as well as in undergraduate mathematics courses, but its generalizability across diverse STEM courses is unknown. We investigated the effect of spaced retrieval practice in nine introductory STEM courses. Retrieval practice opportunities were embedded in bi-weekly quizzes, either massed on a single quiz or spaced over multiple quizzes. Student performance on practice opportunities and a criterial test at the end of each course were examined as a function of massed or spaced practice. We also conducted a single-paper meta-analysis on criterial test scores to assess the generalizability of the effectiveness of spaced retrieval practice across introductory STEM courses. Results: Significant positive effects of spacing on the criterial test were found in only two courses (Calculus I for Engineers and Chemistry for Health Professionals), although small positive effect sizes were observed in two other courses (General Chemistry and Diversity of Life). Meta-analyses revealed a significant spacing effect when all courses were included, but not when calculus was excluded. The generalizability of the spacing effect across STEM courses therefore remains unclear. Conclusions: Although we could not clearly determine the generalizability of the benefits of spacing in STEM courses, our findings indicate that spaced retrieval practice could be a low-cost method of improving student performance in at least some STEM courses. More work is needed to determine when, how, and for whom spaced retrieval practice is most beneficial. The effect of spacing in classroom settings may depend on some design features such as the nature of retrieval practice activities (multiple-choice versus short answer) and/or feedback settings, as well as student actions (e.g., whether they look at feedback or study outside of practice opportunities). The evidence is promising, and further pragmatic research is encouraged.",

This replication-extension study of Susser and McCabe (Susser and McCabe in Instr Sci 41:345-363, 2013) supports their original findings regarding spaced practice and extends the investigation to self-testing. Using the same survey method as the previous researchers, we found that college students showed awareness of the efficacy of spaced practice over massed practice and reported using it in ideal situations. Students reported greater use of spaced studying when a test was difficult, more heavily weighted, or over material of future use. Greater metacognitive self-regulation and elaboration was related to greater reported use of spaced practice. Extending beyond the original study to look self-testing, students were aware of the usefulness of self-testing. Similar to spaced practice, students reported being more likely to use self-testing for more difficult tests and heavily weighted tests. Those with greater metacognitive self-regulation were also more likely to report greater use of self-testing, although greater elaboration was not correlated with reported use of self-testing. Students with a higher GPA were also more likely to report spaced studying and self-testing. Findings suggest that students do know about some effective study strategies. Use of effective strategies may be helpful but students do not report using them in all settings. Educators may be interested in creating circumstances that encourage students to use effective strategies.",

This learning strategy combines two &quot;desirable difficulties&quot;: retrieval practice and spacing effects. We carried out meta-analyses on 29 studies investigating the benefit of spacing out retrieval practice episodes on final retention. The total dataset was divided into two subsets to investigate two main questions: (1) Does spaced retrieval practice induce better memory retention than massed retrieval practice? (subset 1); and (2) Is the expanding spacing schedule superior to the uniform spacing schedule when learning with retrieval practice? (subset 2). Using meta-regression with robust variance estimation, 39 effect sizes were aggregated in subset 1 and 54 in subset 2. Results from subset 1 indicated a strong benefit of spaced retrieval practice in comparison with massed retrieval practice (g = 0.74). Results from subset 2 indicated no significant difference between expanding and uniform spacing schedules of retrieval practice (g = 0.034). Moderator analyses on this subset showed that the number of exposures of an item during retrieval practice explains inconsistencies between studies: the more learners are tested, the more beneficial the expanding schedule is compared with the uniform one. Overall, these results support the advantage of spacing out the retrieval practice episodes on the same content, but do not support the widely held belief that inter-retrieval intervals should be progressively increased until a retention test.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Researchers in the cognitive sciences have identified several key training strategies that support good encoding and retention of target information. These strategies are retrieval-based practice, also known as learning through testing, and spaced practice. The recent resurgence of research on retrieval-based and spaced practice has been extended to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies to support learning in individuals with language disorders. The purpose of the current article is to review key principles of retrieval-based and spaced practice that can be used to support word learning in individuals within clinical and educational contexts. Conclusion: Current research provides evidence that principles of retrieval-based and spaced practice can enhance word learning for individuals with language disorders. Current research provides guidance for clinicians on how to implement these strategies both within and across sessions to support encoding and retention of target information. Additional research should be conducted to provide a better understanding of how to optimize encoding and retention in clinical and educational contexts. Most notably, research that examines long-term retention after interventions are withdrawn would further our understanding of how these principles can be optimally applied to improve outcomes for individuals with language disorders.",

    "abstract": "Students and educators often face time constraints, making it essential to develop interventions that are both easy to implement and have a substantial impact on learning and performance. One promising strategy is retrieval practice, particularly in the context of physics education, where many students struggle with basic knowledge. Prior research has shown that retrieval practice improves self-explanation and problem-solving performance, yet many students avoid it, even when resources are provided. To address this, we introduced a mandatory retrieval test with a minimum benchmark of 50% to encourage greater engagement with retrieval practice. The primary aim of this study was to explore students' experiences with the test and its impact on their use of retrieval practice. A secondary aim was to examine whether increased retrieval practice effort correlated with improved performance on factual, conceptual, and problem-solving exams. Interviews with 13 students revealed that about half crammed for the test, while the other half spaced their practice throughout the semester. Several students noted that the test motivated them to both memorize and understand the principles, with no complaints about the mandatory test. Of the 463 students, 179 achieved a perfect score, suggesting substantial engagement. Effect sizes on factual, conceptual, and problem-solving performance tests ranged from negligible to large, indicating substantial potential benefits with minimal risk. In conclusion, the mandatory retrieval test is an effective, low-effort intervention for educators, promoting greater student adoption of retrieval practice and yielding both qualitative and quantitative evidence of enhanced learning and performance.",

In all experiments, participants studied 40 Swahili-English word pair translations during an initial study phase, restudied intact pairs or attempted to retrieve the English words to Swahili cues twice in three spaced practice sessions, and then completed a final cued-recall test. All 5 sessions were separated by 2 days. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the response format during retrieval (covert vs. overt) and the test list structure (blocked vs. intermixed covert/overt retrieval trials). A memory rating was required on all trials (retrieval: &quot;Was your answer correct?&quot;; restudy: &quot;Would you have remembered the correct translation?&quot;). Response format had no effect on recall, but surprisingly, final test performance for restudied items exceeded both the overt and covert retrieval conditions. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the requirement to make a memory rating. If a memory rating was required, final test restudy performance exceeded retrieval performance, replicating Experiment 1. However, the pattern was descriptively reversed if no rating was required. In Experiment 3, the memory rating was removed altogether, and we examined recall performance for items restudied versus retrieved once, twice, or thrice. Performance improved with practice, and retrieval performance exceeded restudy performance in all conditions. The reversal of the typical retrieval practice effect observed in Experiments 1 and 2 is discussed in terms of theories of reactivity of memory judgments.",

How retrieval can boost the retention of memories is still without unanimous explanation. In 3 experiments, focusing on the reaction time (RT) of retrieval, we showed that RT of retrieval during retrieval practice followed a power function speed up that typically characterizes automaticity and skill learning. More important, it was found that the measure of goodness of fit to this power function was associated with long-term recall success. Here we suggest that the automatization of retrieval is an explanatory component of the testing effect. As a consequence, retrieval-based learning has the properties characteristic of skill learning: diminishing involvement of attentional processes, faster processing, resistance to interference effects, and lower forgetting rate.",

Method: Following a brief review of earlier findings on word learning in children with SLI and the assumptions behind retrieval practice, four experiments are described that compared novel words learned in a repeated spaced retrieval condition and those learned in either a repeated study condition or a repeated immediate retrieval condition. Preschool-age children with SLI and their same-age peers with typical language development were the participants in all experiments. The effects of repeated spaced retrieval were assessed through measures of recall of word form and meaning and, receptively, through both picture-pointing and electrophysiological measures. Results: Repeated spaced retrieval resulted in greater recall of word form and meaning across the experiments. This advantage was seen not only for word-picture pairs used during the learning period but also when generalization of the word to new pictures was required. Receptive testing through picture pointing showed similar results, though in some experiments, ceiling effects rendered this measure less sensitive to differences. An alternative receptive measure--the N400 elicited during picture-word mismatches--showed evidence at the neural level favoring repeated spaced retrieval. The advantages of repeated spaced retrieval were seen in both children with SLI and their typically developing age mates. Conclusion: Future efforts are warranted to refine and extend the experiments reviewed here. If these efforts prove successful, procedures that incorporate repeated spaced retrieval into more naturalistic clinical and educational activities might be an appropriate next step.",

Three types of relation between successive lists were compared: negative transfer (A-B, A-D); a control for item-specific proactive interference (A-B, C-D); and repetition (A-B, A-B). Experiment 1 showed that the benefit of retrieval practice relative to restudying was equivalent for overt and covert retrieval in the negative transfer paradigm (A-B, A-D). Both types of retrieval minimized intrusions of first list responses in the cued recall of the second list. Experiment 2 showed that memory enhancement following covert retrieval was equivalent for new (C-D) and repeated (A-B) lists. The results are consistent with theories of the forward testing effect (FTE) that assume retrieval practice insulates subsequent learning from proactive interference and provides self-assessment feedback that may lead to more efficient encoding in future learning. Challenges in accounting for the impact of a substantial number of moderators of the FTE are reviewed.",

The present research examines how practice, feedback, and instruction influence JOLs for spaced and massed items. In Experiment 1, in which JOLs were made after the presentation of each item and participants were given multiple study-test cycles, JOLs were strongly influenced by the repetition of the items, but there was little difference in JOLs for massed versus spaced items. A similar effect was shown in Experiments 2 and 3, in which participants scored their own recall performance and were given feedback, although participants did learn to assign higher JOLs to spaced items with task experience. In Experiment 4, after participants were given direct instruction about the benefits of spacing, they showed a greater difference for JOLs of spaced vs massed items, but their JOLs still underestimated their recall for spaced items. Although spacing effects are very robust and have important implications for memory and education, people often underestimate the benefits of spaced repetition when learning, possibly due to the reliance on processing fluency during study and attending to repetition, and not taking into account the beneficial aspects of study schedule.",

Cognitive psychologists have recently recommended various techniques educators might use to increase retention. One technique (&quot;spaced retrieval practice&quot;) involves extending opportunities to retrieve course content beyond a customarily short temporal window following initial learning. Confirming the technique's utility requires demonstrating that it increases retention in real classroom settings, with commonly encountered educational content, and that gains endure into subsequent semesters. We manipulated spaced versus massed retrieval practice in a precalculus course for engineering students and followed a subset of students who proceeded into a calculus class the following semester. Spacing versus massing was manipulated within- and between-subjects. Within-subjects, students retained spaced content better than massed content in the precalculus course. Between-subjects, students for whom some retrieval practice was spaced, compared to those for whom all practice was massed, performed better on the final exam in the precalculus class and on exams in the calculus class. These findings suggest that spaced retrieval practice can have a meaningful, long-lasting impact on educational outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The word learning of preschool-age children with developmental language disorder (DLD) is improved when spaced retrieval practice is incorporated into the learning sessions. In this preregistered study, we compared two types of spacing--an expanding retrieval practice schedule and an equally spaced schedule--to determine if one of these approaches yields better word learning outcomes for the children. Method: Fourteen children with DLD aged 4-5 years and 14 same-age children with typical language development (TD) learned eight novel nouns over two sessions. Spacing for half of the novel words was expanded gradually during learning; for the remaining novel words, greater spacing remained at the same level throughout learning. Immediately after the second session and 1 week later, the children's recall of the words was tested. Results: The children with TD recalled more novel words than the children with DLD, although this difference could be accounted for by differences in the children's standardized receptive vocabulary test scores. The two groups were similar in their ability to retain the words over 1 week. Initially, the shorter spacing in the expanding schedule resulted in greater retrieval success than the corresponding (longer spaced) retrieval trials in the equally spaced schedule. These early shorter spaced trials also seemed to benefit retrieval of the trials with greater spacing that immediately followed. However, as the learning period progressed, the accuracy levels for the two conditions converged and were likewise similar during final testing. Conclusion: We need a greater understanding of how and when short spacing can be helpful to children's word learning, with the recognition that early gains might give a misleading picture of the benefits that short spacing can provide to longer term retention.",

    "abstract": "Over a century of research has established practice testing as a highly robust learning strategy that promotes long-term retention. However, learners do not always appreciate the benefits of testing for memory and do not use it as effectively as they could during their own self-regulated learning. The goal of this review is to identify common themes from research focused on learners' metacognition about practice testing using the three components of metacognition (i.e., beliefs, monitoring, and control) as an organizational guide. To foreshadow the key findings from this research: (1) without support, learners lack metacognitive awareness of testing as a tool to enhance memory but do recognize that testing can be used as a monitoring tool; (2) learners can accurately monitor their learning while using practice testing when judgments are made in contexts that are representative of those encountered during a criterion test; (3) in educational contexts, learners report using less effective strategies equally or more often than practice testing; and (4) learners tend to test themselves only under conditions that encourage retrieval success, and rarely use a strategy involving repeated successful retrieval even when it would lead to improved retention. After reviewing research findings, I discuss various interventions that lead to learners using testing more often and more effectively in their own learning and offer recommendations for future research.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this article was to examine how different types of learning experiences affect naming impairment in aphasia. Methods: In 4 people with aphasia with naming impairment, we compared the benefits of naming treatment that emphasized &quot;retrieval practice&quot; (practice retrieving target names from long-term memory) with &quot;errorless learning&quot; (repetition training, which preempts retrieval practice) according to different schedules of learning. The design was within subjects. Items were administered for multiple training trials for retrieval practice or repetition in a &quot;spaced&quot; schedule (an item's trials were separated by multiple unrelated trials) or &quot;massed&quot; schedule (1 trial intervened between an item's trials). In the spaced condition, we studied 3 magnitudes of spacing to evaluate the impact of effortful retrieval during training on the ultimate benefits conferred by retrieval practice naming treatment. The primary outcome was performance on a retention test of naming after 1 day, with a follow-up test after 1 week. Results: Group analyses revealed that retrieval practice outperformed errorless learning, and spaced learning outperformed massed learning at retention test and at follow-up. Increases in spacing in the retrieval practice condition yielded more robust learning of retrieved information. Conclusion: This study delineates the importance of retrieval practice and spacing for treating naming impairment in aphasia.",

    "abstract": "We examined students' naturalistic decisions about spacing their study in an undergraduate course (N=185) and whether self-selected spacing predicted course performance. Usage of two study tools -- an online textbook and quiz tool -- was recorded daily. We operationalized spacing as how often the tools were used and the timing of their use relative to exams. We found that students increased their study near deadlines and exams, used the textbook more often than the quiz tool, and used the tools infrequently when they were optional (vs. required). Importantly, spaced retrieval practice (via quiz tool) predicted course performance and GPA, whereas spaced reading (via textbook) was a weaker predictor. That is, when students opted for more frequent and early quizzing, they earned higher grades, even controlling for time spent quizzing. Thus, self-selected spaced study -- especially spaced retrieval practice -- supports student achievement.

    "abstract": "The testing effect, defined as the positive effect of &quot;retrieval practice&quot; (i.e., self-testing) on long-term memory retention relative to other ways to support learning, is a robust empirical phenomenon. Despite substantial scientific evidence for the testing effect, less is known about its effectiveness in relation to individual differences in cognitive ability. In the present study, we examine whether the effect of retrieval practice is beneficial independent of cognitive ability using behavioral and brain imaging data. In a within-subject design, upper-secondary students learned Swahili-Swedish word pairs through retrieval practice and study. The testing effects were assessed at a direct test and for a subsample after 1- and 4-weeks retention intervals, respectively. Another subsample performed the 1-week retention test during functional MRI (fMRI). Memory retention was analyzed in relation to an educationally relevant composite score dividing participants into low, intermediate, and high cognitive-ability groups. We provide behavioral evidence that the testing effect is independent of cognitive ability. The fMRI findings confirmed a general effectiveness of retrieval practice by showing that brain regions associated with successful retrieval of conceptual representations and semantic processing were more strongly engaged after retrieval practice in all cognitive-ability groups. It is argued that the advantages of retrieval practice should be conveyed to all teachers and students.",

Objective: To determine elements and procedures from the testing effect literature for practical application, devise a method for feasibly and sustainably implementing testing effect methods in practice, and determine if a simple way to incorporate retrieval practice into an existing introduction to psychology course was sufficient to observe testing effects. Method: Quiz scores of Introductory Psychology sections with and without retrieval practice were compared. Sections with retrieval practice also compared the effects of repeated and new questions on quiz performance. Results: Students with retrieval practice performed significantly better on quizzes than those without. Repeated and new retrieval practice were equally superior. Conclusion: Retrieval practices can successfully be implemented, feasibly and sustainably, in an authentic classroom environment. Retrieval practice questions can be related to delayed practice questions, rather than exact repeats, to achieve a testing effect. Teaching Implications: Distributing low stakes multiple-choice questions throughout lectures is effective for increasing test performance. The current method was neither burdensome to workload, content, or resources.",

Midterms may improve learning outcomes by contributing to the testing effect: the phenomenon in which retrieval of learned material (i.e., testing) produces improvements in long-term retention beyond those produced through additional rehearsal or re-exposure (i.e., studying or re-reading). Additionally, increased frequency of testing may impact student behaviors and attitudes (e.g., spaced practice, self-efficacy), increase the testing effect, or impact both, which ultimately improves learning outcomes. This study considered the differential impact of one versus two midterm exams on students' exam difference scores (final exam score minus first midterm exam score). We also considered whether two midterm exams differentially impacted low- and high-achieving students. Results suggest that two midterm exams benefit freshmen but not junior students.",

    "abstract": "Spaced and interleaved practices have been identified as effective learning strategies which sometimes are conflated as a single strategy and at other times treated as distinct. Learning sessions in which studying information or practicing problems are spaced in time with rest-from-deliberate-learning periods between sessions generally result in better learning outcomes than massed practice without rest-from-deliberate-learning periods. Interleaved practice also consists of spaced sessions, but by interleaving topics rather than having rest-from-deliberate-learning periods. Interleaving is usually contrasted with blocking in which each learning topic is taught in a single block that provides an example of massed practice. The general finding that interleaved practice is more effective for learning than blocked practice is sometimes attributed to spacing. In the current paper, the presence of rest-from-deliberate-learning periods is used to distinguish between spaced and interleaved practice. We suggest that spaced practice is a cognitive load effect that can be explained by working memory resource depletion during cognitive effort with recovery during rest-from-deliberate-learning, while interleaved practice can be explained by the discriminative-contrast hypothesis positing that interleaving assists learners to discriminate between topic areas. A systematic review of the literature provides evidence for this suggestion.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims: Current evidence shows that children with developmental language disorder (DLD) benefit from spaced retrieval during word learning activities. Word recall is quite good relative to recall with alternative word learning procedures. However, recall on an absolute basis can be improved further; many studies report that fewer than two-thirds of the words are learned, even with the assistance of spaced retrieval during the learning activities. In this article we identify details of spaced retrieval that are less well understood in an effort to promote more effective learning through retrieval practice. Main contribution: We discuss the importance of factors such as: (a) integrating immediate retrieval with spaced retrieval trials; (b) determining whether gradual increases in spacing have more than short-term benefits relative to equal spacing; (c) discovering the number of successful retrievals sufficient to ensure later recall; (d) using spaced retrieval to avoid erosion of phonetic details on later recall tests; and (e) whether the well-documented difficulties with learning word forms might be tied to a particular subgroup of children with DLD. We also speculate on some of the possible reasons why spaced retrieval is beneficial in the first place. Conclusions: Although many children with DLD make gains in word learning through procedures that incorporate spaced retrieval, there are numerous details involved in the process that can alter its success. Until we have a better understanding of the boundaries of spaced retrieval's effectiveness, we will not be taking full advantage of this promising addition to word learning procedures. Implications: Spaced retrieval activities can be an important addition to the resources that clinicians and educators have available to assist children in their word learning. With a deeper understanding of the issues discussed here, we should be able to put spaced retrieval to even greater use.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval practice is a learning strategy that has repeatedly been found to have positive effects on memory and learning. However, studies indicate that students rarely use retrieval practice on a voluntary basis. The objective of the present study was to examine students' self-regulated use of retrieval practice, and to determine whether sex and individual differences in cognitive and non-cognitive aspects are related to optional use of practice testing. A classroom study was conducted with 146 upper-secondary school students taking courses in mathematics and Swedish. An ABAB design was used to compare students' optional and non-optional use of retrieval practice (i.e., repeated online quizzing). Students performed cognitive tasks to assess working memory capacity and fluid intelligence and completed self-reports of non-cognitive factors related to school achievement, such as grit, need for cognition (NFC), conscientiousness and openness. Quiz use was then compared using paired- and independent-samples t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression analyses explored relations to individual differences. The results showed that students completed significantly fewer quizzes in the optional sections than in the non-optional sections, and that females completed significantly more optional quizzes than males in Swedish, but not in mathematics. Further, the results showed that conscientiousness predicted optional quiz use in mathematics, whereas sex, NFC, conscientiousness, and openness predicted quiz use in Swedish. To conclude, although the findings show a relatively low optional/self-regulated use of practice testing, in line with earlier research, they suggest that sex and non-cognitive factors, such as personality characteristics, can predict optional use of practice testing.",

    "abstract": "When making memory predictions (judgments of learning; JOLs), people typically underestimate the recall gain across multiple study-test cycles, termed the underconfidence-with-practice (UWP) effect. This is usually studied with verbal materials, but little is known about how people repeatedly learn and monitor their own actions and to what extent retrieval practice via interim tests influence the progression of JOLs across cycles. Using action phrases (i.e., &quot;squeeze the lemon&quot;) as learning material, we demonstrated the UWP effect after both verbal and enactive encoding, although we did not get first-cycle overconfidence. As predicted, participants exhibited underconfidence in Cycles 2 and 3, as an error of calibrations. However, people's resolution of JOLs (i.e., ability to discriminate recalled from unrecalled items) increased across study-test cycles. Importantly, JOLs for study-test (relative to study-study) items increased faster across cycles suggesting that repeated study-test practice not only produces underconfidence across cycles, but also reduces underconfidence relative to study-study practice. We discuss these findings in terms of current explanations of the underconfidence-with-practice effect.",

However, while the beneficial effect of testing on learning performances has been confirmed in a large body of literature, the question of exactly how testing influences cognitive and metacognitive processes remains unclear. We therefore set out to investigate the effect of testing on self-regulated learning (SRL) processes. We hypothesized that by recalibrating metacognitive monitoring, regular practice testing can trigger efficient SRL processes and, in turn, foster learning. To test this hypothesis, we exposed first-year undergraduates to a complex neurology module. Participants were randomly assigned to either the practice testing group or a control group. The testing group underwent multiple practice tests during the neurology module, whereas the control group only underwent the multiple practice tests after the course. To assess the impact of practice testing on SRL processes, we combined a think aloud protocol with a metacognitive monitoring self-report measure. Results showed that, compared with controls, participants in the practice testing group were significantly less overconfident in their ability to recall recently learned information and performed better on a posttest questionnaire. Furthermore, mediation analyses confirmed that enhanced learning performance was explained by the use of efficient SRL processes. Therefore, these results allow us to extend the testing effect to SRL, and empirically underscore the central role of monitoring in SRL. Contributions to the fields of practice testing and SRL are discussed.",

Self-explanation, that is, elaborating on what one is trying to learn by asking questions, making inferences, etc., improves learning and may improve retention. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether self-explanation was superior to students' usual study methods specifically for learning some basic concepts in statistics, and, if so, if it was similarly useful for retention a semester after the initial learning. Method: We used 199 college students as participants in a randomized, between participant, two-part experiment examining the effects of training by prompting self-explanations as a potential solution to this applied problem. Results: The self-explanations that we elicited improved initial learning and were superior to students' usual study methods, but did not benefit retention. Conclusions: Future research on improving the quality of the self-explanations and training with spaced retrieval practice, in order to benefit retention, is suggested. Teaching Implication: Self-explanation should be implemented for teaching statistics in order to benefit initial learning. However, teachers should explore other methods to accomplish retention.",

    "abstract": "We present a signal detection-like model termed the stochastic detection and retrieval model (SDRM) for use in studying metacognition. Focusing on paradigms that relate retrieval (e.g., recall or recognition) and confidence judgments, the SDRM measures (1) variance in the retrieval process, (2) variance in the confidence process, (3) the extent to which different sources of information underlie each response, (4) simple bias (i.e., increasing or decreasing confidence criteria across conditions), and (5) metacognitive bias (i.e., contraction or expansion of the confidence criteria across conditions). In the metacognition literature, gamma correlations have been used to measure the accuracy of confidence judgments. However, gamma cannot distinguish between the first 3 attributes, and it cannot measure either form of bias. In contrast, the SDRM can distinguish among the attributes, and it can measure both forms of bias. In this way, the SDRM can be used to test competing process theories by determining the attribute that best accounts for a change across conditions. To demonstrate the SDRM's usefulness, we investigated judgments of learning (JOLs) followed by cued-recall. Through a series of nested and non-nested model comparisons applied to a new experiment, the SDRM determined that a reduction in variance during the confidence process is the most likely explanation of the delayed-JOL effect, and a stronger relation between information underlying JOLs and recall is the most likely explanation of the testing-JOL effect. Following a brief discussion of implications for JOL theories, we conclude with a broader discussion of how the SDRM can benefit metacognition research.

    "abstract": "Spaced practice is a recognized effective study approach that fosters mastery of learning and retention of information. In this paper, we share one instructor's experience in introducing a spaced practice intervention in a large general chemistry course and in encouraging students to continue the strategy in the next semester organic chemistry course. The curricular implementation spanned two years during the COVID pandemic and encompassed the instructors' ongoing responsive efforts to enhance students' success. Student perspectives of the perceived value and their use of spaced practice varied with the instructor's conditions of the implementation. Offering spaced practice midway in a semester as an optional approach to homework garnered a positive student response and outcomes. However, moving to a required format for spaced practice in a subsequent semester resulted in much more mixed student feedback and outcomes. The instructor also encouraged and guided students in utilizing the strategy in the following organic chemistry course, and although over 70% of students planned to use it, only about a third actually persisted in the practice. When offering students effective study approaches through course design, instructors also have the challenge and opportunity to cultivate students' intrinsic motivation and self-regulation, skills that enhance their success more broadly. Instructors need to consider investing time in promoting and demonstrating the impact of the method on students' learning, nudging and encouraging students to persevere, and demonstrating metacognitive approaches to learning throughout the course to help students realize its rewards.",

Participants studied Swahili--English word pairs and repeatedly studied half the pairs or attempted retrieval, with feedback, for the remaining half. Word pairs were easy or difficult to learn. Overall, participants showed a benefit of testing over restudy. However, almost 1/3 of the sample had a negative testing effect and benefitted more from restudy than testing, as well as performing better overall. These individuals self-reported less use of shallower encoding strategies than positive testing effect participants but did not differ in other dimensions. For individuals with a positive testing effect, difficulty had differential effects on participants who scored high or low on a measure of gF, with high gF participants showing larger testing effects for difficult over easy items, whereas low gF participants showed the opposite. Working memory performance was not related to the magnitude of the testing effect; however, vocabulary knowledge revealed a similar pattern as gF, with higher vocabulary associated with a testing effect for difficult but not easy items. This suggests that the benefit of retrieval practice varies with item difficulty and participant abilities. Thus, recommendations to engage in retrieval practice should take into consideration the interactive effects of to-be-learned materials and individual differences in the learners.",

In a within-subject design, 54 university students studied two expository texts, followed by retrieval practice with either short-answer tasks (targeted retrieval) or a free-recall task (holistic retrieval). Concerning the direct effects of retrieval practice, short-answer tasks led to increased retention of directly retrieved targeted information from the learning contents, whereas free-recall tasks led to better retention of further information from the learning contents. Concerning indirect effects, short-answer tasks improved metacognitive calibration; free-recall tasks increased self-efficacy and situational interest. These findings confirm the assumption that the effects of retrieval practice depend on the type of recall task: short-answer tasks help us remember targeted information units and foster metacognitive calibration. Free-recall tasks help us remember a broader spectrum of information, and they foster motivational factors.",

Although only one-third of the intervention group utilized the flashcards, evidence for self-selection bias was limited. Card users significantly outperformed non-users on the final exam (d = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001), were nearly three times more likely to pass (OR = 2.84 [1.35, 6.01]), and over twice as likely to achieve the highest grade (OR = 2.31 [1.35, 3.98]). Flashcard use remained a significant predictor of exam performance after controlling for age, prior academic performance, study time, and study material covered.

One potential explanation for the mixed findings is the truncated search hypothesis, which states that not all delayed JOLs lead to a full-blown covert retrieval attempt. In three paired-associate learning experiments, we examined the effect of delayed JOLs on later recall by comparing them to conditions of restudy, overt retrieval, and various other delayed JOL conditions. In Experiment 1, after an initial study phase, subjects either restudied word pairs, practiced overt retrieval, or made cue-only or cue-target delayed JOLs. In Experiments 2a and 2b, where conditions were manipulated within-subjects, subjects either restudied word pairs, practiced overt retrieval, made cue-only delayed JOLs, made cue-only delayed JOLs followed by a &quot;yes/no&quot; retrieval question or, in another condition, by an overt retrieval prompt. The final cued recall tests were delayed by two days. In Experiment 1, recall after cue-only delayed JOLs did not reliably differ from recall after overt retrieval or restudy. In Experiments 2a and 2b, delayed JOLs consistently produced poorer recall relative to overt retrieval. Furthermore, reaction times for delayed JOLs were shorter relative to delayed JOLs paired with overt retrieval prompts. We conclude that only some delayed JOLs elicit covert retrieval attempts, a pattern supporting the truncated search hypothesis.",

The current study is a conceptual replication of a previous study, further investigating whether the testing effect is sensitive to individual differences in the personality traits Grit and Need for Cognition, and working memory capacity. Using a within-subjects design (N = 151), participants practiced 60 Swahili-Swedish word pairs (e.g., adhama-honor) through retrieval practice and re-studying. Learning was assessed at three time points: five minutes, one week, and four weeks after practice. The results revealed a significant testing effect at all three time points. Further, the results showed no association between the testing effect and the personality traits, or between the testing effect and working memory, at any time point. To conclude, retrieval practice seems to be a learning technique that is not moderated by individual differences in these specific personality traits or with working memory capacity, thus possibly beneficial for all students.",

First, Van Gog and Sweller's idea of &quot;element interactivity&quot; is not defined in a quantitative, measurable way. As a consequence, the idea is applied inconsistently in their literature review. Second, none of the experiments on retrieval practice with worked-example materials manipulated element interactivity. Third, Van Gog and Sweller's literature review omitted several studies that have shown retrieval practice effects with complex materials, including studies that directly manipulated the complexity of the materials. Fourth, the experiments that did not show retrieval practice effects, which were emphasized by Van Gog and Sweller, either involved retrieval of isolated words in individual sentences or required immediate, massed retrieval practice. The experiments failed to observe retrieval practice effects because of the retrieval tasks, not because of the complexity of the materials. Finally, even though the worked-example experiments emphasized by Van Gog and Sweller have methodological problems, they do not show strong evidence favoring the null. Instead, the data provide evidence that there is indeed a small positive effect of retrieval practice with worked examples. Retrieval practice remains an effective way to improve meaningful learning of complex materials.",

The experiment presented here uses conditional probability to disentangle test-potentiated learning from the direct effects of retrieval practice.

    "abstract": "Retrieval practice promotes retention more than restudying (i.e., the &quot;testing effect&quot;) and is applied to many educational settings. However, little research has investigated means to enhance this effect in educational settings. Theoretical accounts assume retrieval practice to be the most effective whenever retrieval is difficult but successful. Therefore, we developed a novel retrieval practice procedure, which adapts to learners' abilities and can be applied irrespective of learning content. This adaptive procedure aims to make retrieval gradually easier whenever students provide an incorrect answer. In a field experiment, students read book chapters as part of a weekly university course. In three consecutive weeks, they then practiced reading assignments by (a) adaptive testing, (b) non-adaptive testing and (c) restudy. In Week 4, a surprise criterial test took place. Restudy outperformed both testing conditions, whereas adaptive testing performed equally well as non-adaptive testing. However, exploratory analyses revealed that with increasing retention intervals, the superiority of restudy disappeared. Furthermore, whenever participants fully read the assignments and retention intervals increased, adaptive testing outperformed non-adaptive testing. In sum, adaptive retrieval practice did not prove to be generally superior, but retention interval and students' preparation for class might be conditions rendering adaptive retrieval useful in educational settings.",

    "abstract": "Past work has shown that generating explanations can improve both comprehension and metacomprehension outcomes. Although practice testing may sometimes improve comprehension, it is unclear if it affects metacomprehension (the ability to monitor one's understanding). The current study tested whether online homework activities involving practice testing alone might improve comprehension and metacomprehension when learning from textbook excerpts in an introductory science course, or whether engaging in explanation activities is critical for better outcomes. Results showed that practice testing did facilitate comprehension of the studied topics, but it failed to improve skills in comprehension monitoring on a new set of topics and exacerbated overconfidence. In contrast, metacomprehension accuracy increased when students generated explanations as part of online homework activities.",

    "abstract": "Repeated retrieval practice is a powerful learning tool for promoting long-term retention, but students use this tool ineffectively when regulating their learning. The current experiments evaluated the efficacy of a minimal intervention aimed at improving students' self-regulated use of repeated retrieval practice. Across 2 experiments, students made decisions about when to study, engage in retrieval practice, or stop learning a set of foreign language word pairs. Some students received direct instruction about how to use repeated retrieval practice. These instructions emphasized the mnemonic benefits of retrieval practice over a less effective strategy (restudying) and told students how to use repeated retrieval practice to maximize their performance--specifically, that they should recall a translation correctly 3 times during learning. This minimal intervention promoted more effective self-regulated use of retrieval practice and better retention of the translations compared to a control group that received no instruction. Students who experienced this intervention also showed potential for long-term changes in self-regulated learning: They spontaneously used repeated retrieval practice 1 week later to learn new materials. These results provide a promising first step for developing guidelines for teaching students how to regulate their learning more effectively using repeated retrieval practice.",

In a within-subjects design, N = 180 students completed an intermediate knowledge test in the 9th session and a final test in the 13th session of the semester. Both tests assessed students' correctness of answering and confidence in their answers. In the final test, items that were intermediately tested were answered as correctly as items that were not intermediately tested. The failure to find a testing effect at the level of cognitive performance could not be attributed to interference with item difficulty, as intermediately tested and not tested items were balanced according to their a priori difficulty. However, testing improved performance at the metacognitive level. Confidence ratings were more accurate and less biased in items that were intermediately tested compared to items not intermediately tested. The results are discussed in the context of metacognitive monitoring as a condition of self-regulated learning in an authentic psychology learning context.",

    "abstract": "We performed 4 experiments assessing the learning that occurs when taking a test. Our experiments used multiple-choice tests because the processes deployed during testing can be manipulated by varying the nature of the choice alternatives. Previous research revealed that a multiple-choice test that includes &quot;none of the above&quot; (NOTA) produces better performance on a subsequent test only when the correct answer is something other than NOTA (Odegard &amp; Koen, 2007). However, when NOTA was an incorrect choice alternative, the correct answer was the only familiar alternative. Thus, familiarity may have allowed participants to identify the answer, which was then restudied. In other words, the testing benefit might have reflected a familiarity-guided restudy process rather than retrieval practice. In the current study, we examined the role of familiarity in the multiple-choice testing effect, manipulating the familiarity of alternatives. If NOTA was the correct answer, there was no testing benefit when the alternatives were all novel (Experiment 1) or all familiar (Experiment 3). Familiarity-guided restudy predicts memory impairment when there is a single familiar alternative for a NOTA-correct question. In contradiction to this hypothesis, there was a testing benefit for this condition (Experiments 2 and 4). Experiment 4 further collected metacognitive confidence ratings during the multiple-choice test, providing evidence of a recall-to-reject strategy for this condition. These results suggest that learning from multiple-choice tests is mainly due to retrieval practice rather than the use of familiarity.",

    "abstract": "Memory retrieval affects subsequent memory in ways both positive (e.g., the testing effect) and negative (e.g., retrieval-induced forgetting, RIF). The changes to memory that retrieval produces can be thought of as the encoding consequences of retrieval, examined here with respect to attention. In three experiments, participants first studied category--example word pairs, and then practiced retrieval for half the pairs from one-third of the categories (the R+ items) and restudied half the pairs from a different third of the categories (the S+ items), while the final third of the categories were in the nonpracticed control condition (the Np items). This was followed in turn by a final test over all categories and examples, including the unpracticed examples from the retrieval-practice and restudied categories (the R- and S- items, respectively). The middle phase (of retrieval practice and restudy) was conducted under full attention (FA) or under divided attention (DA) in which participants also performed a distracting secondary task. DA had little effect on final recall in the retrieval practice (R+) condition but significantly reduced final recall of the restudied (S+) items, producing a net increase in the testing effect relative to the FA condition. RIF (measured as the difference between the R- and Np items) was substantial in the FA condition but was eliminated by DA. This occurred because the final recall of R- items significantly increased in the DA compared to FA condition, a highly unusual result in which distraction actually improved an aspect of memory performance. In sum, DA during retrieval practice dissociated the positive and negative effects of retrieval on subsequent memory, increasing the positive effect, embodied by the testing effect, but decreasing the negative effect, embodied by RIF. The theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Successive relearning involves repeated retrieval practice of the same information (with feedback) over multiple, spaced sessions. We implemented successive relearning in an introductory psychology class to explore potential learning benefits. After each weekly lecture, students were sent links via e-mail to engage in three learning practice sessions, each separated by 2 days. Half the students engaged in successive relearning (&quot;relearn&quot; condition), answering 20 fill-in-the-blank questions with corrective feedback. Within each session, correctly answered questions were dropped, whereas incorrectly answered questions were presented up to two more times. The other half of students restudied the same 20 sentences without blanks twice per session (&quot;restudy&quot; condition). Unlike previous research, we controlled the exposure duration of the learning materials between the relearn and restudy conditions. Learning practice sessions continued throughout the remaining 10 weeks of the semester, with students alternating each week between the relearning and restudying tasks. Recall of course material at the end of the semester was better for relearning compared with restudying. Increased recall during relearning sessions was associated with further learning benefits including improved metacognition, increased self-reported sense of mastery, increased attentional control, and reduced anxiety. Individual differences were not associated with the benefit of relearning over restudying in the retention tests. Qualitative feedback indicated that students found successive relearning to be enjoyable and valuable. Our research indicates that successive relearning is a valuable addition to any university course and is easy to implement using digital resources.",

    "abstract": "Self-explanation, a learning strategy where students explain to themselves the steps taken in a worked example, is an effective learning strategy in early cognitive skill acquisition. However, many physics students produce self-explanations of low quality. There is also a lack of guidelines for what students should seek to explain when studying worked examples. Therefore, the overarching purpose of this article is to investigate how we can improve students' self-explanations of worked examples. We pursue the following two general research questions: (1) What knowledge representations should students seek while self-explaining worked examples to maximize their learning? (2) Can retrieval practice of physics principles and their conditions of application potentiate students' learning from self-explaining worked examples? In two studies (n = 18 and N = 54), we qualitatively categorized and quantified the students' written self-explanations. Our results indicate that to produce useful knowledge, self-explanations of the physics model in worked examples should explain what principle is used, how the principle is set up, and how the conditions of application are met for the principle, while explanations of the mathematical procedures should contain action descriptions, goals, and conditions (r = 0.30-0.50). Through a quasiexperimental (N = 57) and an experimental (N = 54) test, we found evidence that retrieval practice of physics principles and their conditions of application before self-explanation can have a medium-sized effect on post-test problem-solving scores and that it can increase the quality of students' self-explanations. Using retrieval practice to potentiate learning from more complex learning strategies is a novel and promising approach to improve physics students' learning.",

Participants studied works of art by different artists grouped in blocks, where works by a particular artist were either presented all together successively (the massed condition), or interleaved with the works of other artists (the spaced condition). The works of 24 artists were shown, with 12, 15, or 18 works by each artist being provided as exemplars. Later, different works by the same artists were presented for a test of the artists' identity. During the course of studying these works, participants were probed for mind wandering. It was found that people mind wandered more when the exemplars were presented in a massed rather than in a spaced manner, especially as the task progressed. There was little mind wandering and little difference between massed and spaced conditions toward the beginning of study. People were better able to correctly attribute the new works to the appropriate artist (inductive learning) when (a) they were in the spaced condition and (b) they had not been mind wandering. This research suggests that inductive learning may be influenced by mind wandering and that the impairment in learning with massed practice (compared to spaced practice) may be attributable, at least in part, to attentional factors--people are &quot;on task&quot; less fully when the stimuli are massed rather than spaced.",

Applying various intervention design principles that leverage sociomotivational research, we created an intervention targeted not only at teaching students about the efficacy of retrieval practice, but also at changing their study behaviors. We focused on increasing students' understanding of how to implement retrieval practice effectively and decreasing their perceived cost of using retrieval practice. We found that our intervention increased students' procedural metacognitive knowledge (that retrieval practice can be implemented flexibly in various formats) and intended use of retrieval practice, but it did not reduce perceived cost (that engaging in retrieval practice costs too much time and effort), as compared to a traditional retrieval practice intervention. There were also no effects of our intervention on reported use of retrieval practice. Furthermore, results from a structural equation model analysis showed that self-efficacy of procedural metacognitive knowledge was positively associated with students' intended use of the strategy, whereas perceived cost was negatively associated with their reported use of the strategy. Alleviating perceived cost could be a potential venue for future intervention aimed at encouraging the self-regulated use of retrieval practice.",

    "abstract": "African Americans have suffered many negative consequences as a result of racism. African Americans are currently underperforming their White counterparts in the field of Mathematics. Several examples have indicated that the appropriate use of resources can significantly affect this gap in performance. The concepts of deep study and spaced retrieval practice have been shown in several situations to have positive effects on student's academic outcomes. This study educated African Americans students on these two concepts. The study found that students had little knowledge of spaced retrieval practice and approaches to study. There are many obstacles to students using these methods, like the timing of due dates of assignments. Participants made rational decisions on when and how to use the deep and surface approach to study. The study suggests that institutions should assess the knowledge of spaced retrieval practice and approach to study of incoming students and address any deficiencies. There is more to learn about the study process. This paper presents a five stage study process. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

    "abstract": "A B S T R A CT Purpose: Retrieval practice has been shown to assist the word learning of children with developmental language disorder (DLD). Although this has been true for learning new verbs as well as new nouns and adjectives, these children's overall verb learning has remained quite low. In this preregistered study, we presented novel verbs in transitive sentences with varying subjects/agents and objects/patients to determine if recall could be improved and if retrieval practice continued to be facilitative. Method: Fourteen children with DLD aged 4--5 years and 13 same-age peers with typical language development (TD) learned eight novel verbs over two sessions. Half of the novel verbs were presented with spacing between study and retrieval trials, and half were presented with the same frequency in study trials without the opportunity for retrieval. All novel verbs were presented in sentences such as, &quot;The woman is deeking the shoe.&quot; Children's ability to recall and use the novel verbs in the same sentence structure was tested after the second session and 1 week later. The children were also required to use the novel verbs in bare-stem form in a new structure, as in, &quot;That woman likes to deek the towel.&quot; Results: Both groups of children showed increased recall relative to a previous novel verb study. The children with TD showed the expected advantages of spaced retrieval over repeated study and could use the novel verbs in the new morphological form and sentence structure. The children with DLD, however, showed an advantage for spaced retrieval only shortly after the learning period. These children had great difficulty changing the novel verbs to a bare stem and using them in a new structure. Conclusion: Although spaced retrieval assists children's novel verb recall, children with DLD in particular require additional help using these verbs with morphological and syntactic flexibility.",

    "abstract": "The testing effect--the power of retrieval practice to enhance long-term knowledge retention more than restudying does--is a well-known phenomenon in learning. However, retrieval practice is hardly appreciated by students and underutilized when studying. One of the reasons is that learners usually do not experience immediate benefits of such practice which often present only after a delay. We therefore conducted 2 experiments to examine whether students choose retrieval practice more often as their learning strategy after having experienced its benefits. In Experiment 1, students received individual feedback about the extent to which their 7-day delayed test scores after retrieval practice differed from their test scores after restudy. Those students who had actually experienced the benefits of retrieval practice appreciated the strategy more and used it more often after receiving feedback. In Experiment 2, we compared the short-term and long-term effects on retrieval practice use of individual performance feedback and general instruction about the testing effect. Although both interventions enhanced its use in the short term, only the individual feedback led to enhanced use in the long term by those who had actually experienced its benefits, demonstrating the superiority of the individual feedback in terms of its ability to promote retrieval practice use.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval practice relative to restudy of learned material typically attenuates time-dependent forgetting. A recent study examining this testing effect across 12-h delays filled with nocturnal sleep versus daytime wakefulness, however, showed that sleep directly following encoding benefited recall of restudied but not of retrieval practiced items, which reduced, and even eliminated, the testing effect after sleep (Bäuml, Holterman, &amp; Abel, 2014). The present study investigated, in 4 experiments, whether this modulating role of sleep for the testing effect is influenced by two factors that have previously been shown to increase the testing effect: corrective feedback and prolonged retention intervals. Experiments 1a and 1b applied 12-h delays and showed benefits of sleep for recall after both restudy and retrieval practice with feedback, but not after retrieval practice without feedback. Experiments 2a and 2b applied 24-h or 7-day delays and failed to observe any long-lasting benefits of sleep directly after encoding, on both restudied and retrieval practiced items. These results indicate that both corrective feedback and prolonged retention intervals reduce the modulating role of sleep for the testing effect as it can be observed after 12-h delays and in the absence of corrective feedback, which suggests a fairly limited influence of sleep on the effect.",

In two experiments, we examined retrieval practice and restudy of Swahili-Swedish word pairs in relation to individual differences in Grit and NFC. In Experiment 1, using a between-subjects design, a significant main effect of retention interval was qualified by a Group Retention Interval interaction. However, there were no effects of Grit or NFC. In Experiment 2, a within-subjects design was used, and a measure of WMC was included. The analyses revealed a testing effect; but again, WMC, Grit, and NFC were not significantly associated with performance.

The final test comprised four test formats, one identical to the initial test (non-transfer context), and three deviating from the initial test (transfer context). Comparing testing and restudy conditions yielded a significant multivariate effect of testing across all final test formats and significant univariate effects in three of the four test formats. Comparing transfer and non-transfer contexts revealed smaller retrieval practice effects when transfer was required.

    "abstract": "The benefits of retrieval practice (practice testing) are pervasive across various materials, learning conditions, and criterial tasks, and consequently researchers and educators have enthusiastically recommended retrieval practice for educational applications. Less research has been devoted to examining the effect of combining retrieval practice with other evidence-based learning strategies; this article focuses on an emerging literature that examines the outcomes of combining potent elaborative encoding methods with retrieval practice. Theoretically, several possibilities can be identified. Augmenting retrieval practice with effective encoding strategies could significantly improve learning relative to retrieval practice alone through complementary mechanisms of each or through effective encoding catalyzing retrieval practice effects. Alternatively, effective encoding combined with retrieval practice might not improve learning (relative to retrieval practice alone), because the processing produced by elaborative encoding strategies is overly redundant with those promoted by retrieval practice. The extant literature, which has focused on everyday learning tasks (e.g., name learning) and educationally relevant tasks ranging from learning of arbitrary associations (e.g., new vocabulary meanings) to learning from connected discourse, is reviewed, and helps inform these possibilities. The findings largely converge on the conclusion that incorporating elaborative encoding techniques with retrieval practice prior to, but not concurrent with, retrieval practice provides a boost for learning and retention.",

A true experimental design was used to randomly assign 103 undergraduate students from an education course to trained (n = 49) and control (n = 54) conditions. The primary goals of this work were to examine whether training metacognitive monitoring and control skills for retrieval practice increases students' academic performance, their independent use of practice-testing, and the accuracy of the metacognitive monitoring judgments they make based on external feedback. During the semester, students completed a pre- and postmetacognitive awareness inventory (MAI), 10 practice-tests, 10 feedback monitoring assignments, and a cumulative final examination. The feedback assignments required students to identify areas of mastery (i.e., well-learned topics) and areas of weakness (i.e., yet-to-be-learned topics). In addition, students were asked to monitor the effectiveness of their current strategies (i.e., monitoring strategy use) and to select a study strategy for their examination preparation (i.e., control strategy decisions). Students who completed the metacognitive retrieval practice training scored higher on final exam items that were not previously quizzed, compared with the control group. In an overall mediation model, when all of the relations among metacognitive, control, and outcome variables were examined simultaneously, yet-to-be-learned monitoring accuracy had the strongest indirect effect of training on final examination performance for nonquizzed items. These findings suggest that monitoring feedback accurately from practice-tests is important and can be improved with training.",

Objective: This study examines the associations between self-reported exam score and study techniques among students in two courses, Introductory Psychology and Computer Science. Method: We used an online survey to measure the extent students (N = 249) used 10 techniques studied in cognitive science. We also measured students' perseverance, metacognitive skill, distractions, and procrastination. Results: Student use of specific study techniques varied between the two courses and a high utility technique, practice testing, was well used. Students reported low levels of spaced practice. Perseverance and metacognitive skills both correlated significantly with many of the study techniques. While no study techniques predicted exam scores in Introductory Psychology beyond variance predicted by GPA, the use of spaced practice predicted a significant portion of variance in students in Computer Science. Conclusions: Students' use of study techniques varies between their courses and while related to GPA and exam scores, are not unique predictors of variance in learning. Additional moderators and mediators of learning need to be identified. Teaching Implications: We discuss ways instructors can help prepare students in Introductory Psychology and key needs for future research on studying.",

We hypothesized that an effect similar to this forward testing effect would also occur when making judgments of (prior) learning (JOLs). Previous research showed that making JOLs likely prompts covert retrieval attempts and thereby enhances memory, specifically when providing only parts of previously studied information. This study examined the forward effect of different types of JOLs (i.e., with complete or partial prior study information available) on subsequent learning of new materials, compared to restudy and retrieval practice. In a between-subjects design, participants (N = 161) consecutively studied five lists of 20 words with the aim to recall as many of them on a final cumulative recall test. After the presentation of each of the first four lists, participants either restudied the list, made JOLs with complete words, made JOLs with word stems, or they were tested on word stems. Compared to restudy, practicing retrieval and making JOLs with word stems, but not JOLs with complete words, facilitated the List-5 interim recall performance and attenuated the number of intrusions from prior lists. The findings suggest that, similar to overt retrieval, making JOLs with incomplete information can enhance new learning to the extent that it elicits covert retrieval attempts.",

Participants studied a text on the effects of online streaming behaviour by means of retrieval practice or by copying the text. Knowledge gain was assessed after one (Experiment 1) and two weeks (Experiment 2). Attitudes and behaviour were assessed pre- and post-intervention. In both experiments, participants recalled more environmental knowledge after retrieval practice compared to copying. Attitudes and behaviour did not differ between both groups, but attitudes increased after the intervention in both groups. Only Experiment 1 showed declining streaming times.

    "abstract": "The approach that students take in their studies at university is critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in life-long learning for their career and professional development. Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material. Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term compared to 'cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years, suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing interest in spaced retrieval methods, a research gap has been discovered, with insufficient data to support best practises in year-one science. After analysing five systematic action cycles, four interrelated themes emerged: dual coding, cognitive load, peer communication, and feedback-driven metacognition. While literature emphasises the need to take a child's cognitive load into account, the themes of peer communication and dual coding provoked debate among participants. Despite this conflict, an agreement was reached on how limited reading abilities affect retrieval practise. While this small-scale study cannot draw definitive conclusions, I discovered that by optimising cognitive load, teachers can ensure that a task is desirably difficult using dual coding, discussion, and feedback-driven metacognition, all of which contributed to the success of knowledge acquisition methodologies. According to my research, ensuring a retrieval task is challenging, increases children's development of retention of scientific knowledge. However, minimising literacy constraints is critical to avoid thinking being exhausted by writing or reading, rather than recalling and applying. Consequently, the relevance of the study for education and society is illustrated by the findings, which emphasise the necessity to reduce extraneous load (reading and writing) during retrieval tasks and propose potential solutions to this issue.",

    "abstract": "Study strategies that learners utilize impact how much they learn. Practicing retrieval from long-term memory (e.g., practice tests or flashcards) is a particularly effective study strategy that can provide large learning benefits; yet, students rarely recognize the benefits of retrieval practice. Here, we examine whether a sample of middle and high school students report using retrieval practice when studying on their own, why they use it, and whether its use varies by age and learning domain. The results show that most middle and high school students in our sample report using retrieval practice, but students utilize re-reading strategies more. The high school students in our sample report using retrieval practice more than the surveyed middle school students, and this may be driven by differences in their reasoning for using it. Finally, students' ages and learning domains interact to affect how widely retrieval practice is utilized. Students' use of retrieval practice grows with age and changes by domain. While more students report using retrieval practice than in prior literature, many students still fail to fully harness the learning benefits that retrieval practice can provide.",

    "abstract": "Memory retrieval often enhances still later memory as evidenced by the testing effect. Divided attention (DA) is known to produce different effects on encoding and retrieval, substantially disrupting the former and often producing little effect on the latter. The present experiments examine whether the mnemonic consequences of retrieval are similarly resilient in the face of distraction or if they have a similar sensitivity to DA as study-based encoding. In 2 experiments, participants initially studied a set of word pairs (Phase 1) then engaged in restudy of some pairs and retrieval practice of others (Phase 2), followed by either an immediate or (24-hr) delayed final cued-recall test (Phase 3). Phase 2 restudy and retrieval practice occurred under full attention (FA) or DA. Phase 2 performance replicated earlier research in finding little effect of DA on retrieval success, and greater disruption to the secondary task in the retrieval than restudy condition. More importantly, the testing effect on the final test (the difference between the retrieval and restudy conditions) was greater in the DA than FA condition. Final recall was substantially reduced by DA in the restudy condition but not in the retrieval condition. This pattern was found for related and unrelated word pairs, with feedback during retrieval practice and without, for immediate as well as delayed final tests, and for high as well as low performance on the secondary task. The encoding effects of retrieval appear to be more resilient in the face of distraction than the encoding effects of restudy.",

For restudy (2 days later), students either copied their notes or did retrieval practice. For the final test (an additional 2 days later), all students did a recall task from memory. Students in the retrieval practice condition showed better retention of information than students in the copy condition.

    "abstract": "In human-AI collaboration, task delegation is a critical component. Ideally, if a person believes they are capable of completing a task, they should do so themselves; otherwise, the task should be delegated to the other party. Such delegation decisions are influenced by individuals' assessments of their own abilities, which are shaped by metacognition-the capacity to evaluate one's own capacities. High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technology that can regulate the excitability of the cerebral cortex to improve human performance. This protocol presents a method that employs HD-tDCS to investigate its effects on human metacognition during human-AI delegation tasks, detailing the procedure for applying anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Stimulation was performed using a portable HD-tDCS device, using a circumferential arrangement of five electrodes, including one target electrode and four return electrodes. The stimulation lasted for a total of 21 min, and the current intensity was 2 mA. This method is expected to provide a new research path for further in-depth exploration of the neural mechanisms and behavioral regulation of humans in the process of human-AI collaborative task delegation and provide a solid theoretical basis for further optimizing human-AI collaborative tasks.",

    "abstract": "Active goal setting and metacognition are components of self-regulated learning, helping medical students thrive in high-pressure environments. To support self-regulated learning and well-being, we must better understand the types of goals medical students set, how they formulate goals, their metacognitive awareness of goal setting and how these factors impact well-being. The overarching objective of this study is to explore how medical students develop goal-setting behaviours and abilities. We also characterised their metacognitive ability around goal setting and probed how they felt their behaviours impacted well-being. In this qualitative reflexive thematic analysis study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 medical students in all years from 6 Canadian medical schools. The study received ethics approval. Our analysis revealed three major themes around goal-setting behaviours, student metacognition and implications: (1) Students have limited awareness of their goal-setting process, preferences and the associated consequences. (2) Students' goal-setting tendencies and processes can be described by goal-setting scripts-flexible or concrete. (3) Goal-setting scripts are modified in response to external factors, occasionally leading to approaches that may be incongruent with a student's preferred goal-setting style. This research offers important insight into goal-setting behaviours of medical students. Flexible and concrete goal-setting scripts introduce another framework through which educators and learners alike can examine and reflect upon goal-setting strategies. Implications of the scripts being modified due to external drivers need to be considered to support learners. Students have limited awareness and purposiveness around their goal-setting behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes poses a significant global health threat due to its increasing prevalence and associated comorbidities, straining healthcare systems worldwide. Depression and anxiety are frequent comorbidities in individuals with diabetes, and their underlying mechanisms have been a subject of research. This study investigated the influence of metacognitions and metacognitions about symptom control (MaSC) on depression and anxiety in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), specifically examining their effects beyond illness representations. Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study involved 153 T2D patients. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ), Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Metacognitions about Symptom Control Scale-Revised (MaSCS-R), and the Protection Motivation Theory Scale for COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that after controlling for socio-demographic variables, fear of COVID-19, and illness representations, negative metacognitions about symptom control predicted 2% of anxiety and 4% of depression; metacognitions predicted 10% of anxiety and 9% of depression. Metacognitions predicted both depression and anxiety, supporting the Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model. Metacognitive therapy could be an alternative for managing emotional distress in T2D patients and may contribute to future research.",

    "abstract": "Theory of mind (ToM) is a foundational ability for social functioning and interpersonal relationships. This study aims to examine theory of mind components in major depressive disorder and its relationship with metacognitive functions and attachment styles. The study enrolled 64 patients with major depressive disorder and 64 healthy controls. The control group was selected to match the patient group regarding age, gender, marital status, and educational level. Every participant completed the sociodemographic data form, the Hinting Test, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, the Adult Attachment Style Scale, and the Metacognition Questionnaire. The severity of depression symptoms was evaluated using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17. The average overall score of the metacognition questionnaire was substantially greater in the patient group (p&amp;lt;0.001) compared to the control group. The average score for the Hinting Task was substantially lower in the patients compared to the control group (p&amp;lt;0.001). The severity of depressive symptoms showed a strong negative correlation with the Hinting Task score (r=-0.759; p&amp;lt;0.001), and a moderate negative correlation with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test score (r=-0.589; p&amp;lt;0.001). This study showed that depressed individuals have impairments in reading the minds of others&amp;rsquo; around them and in their metacognitive functions. The findings above highlight the need to integrate techniques centered on enhancing fundamental theory of mind reasoning into current therapy interventions in order to enhance the comprehension and interpretation of social information among individuals experiencing depression.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are transforming educational settings by offering tools that enhance learning experiences. AI-powered applications, such as ChatGPT and Poe, provide real-time assistance, fostering learner autonomy and self-determined motivation. However, limited research has explored their impact on undergraduate students' learning strategies and motivation. This study investigates the effectiveness of AI-powered educational applications in enhancing metacognitive and social learning strategies, as well as self-determined motivation, among Chinese undergraduate students. This mixed-methods quasi-experimental study involved 310 undergraduates (45% female, 55% male; M age&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) at the Criminal Investigation Police University of China. Participants were assigned to an AI-integrated experimental group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;139) or a control group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;171). Validated questionnaires assessed metacognitive/social strategies (SILL) and autonomous motivation (RAI). Qualitative data from 834 reflective journals were thematically analyzed. ANCOVA was used to compare post-test outcomes, controlling for pre-test scores, while journals provided experiential insights. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study investigated the impact of AI-integrated instruction on metacognitive strategies, social strategies, and motivation in 310 undergraduate students. ANCOVA revealed significant improvements in the AI group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001), with large effect sizes observed for metacognition (&#x3b7;&#xb2; = 0.39) and motivation (&#x3b7;&#xb2; = 0.31), which are large effect sizes according to Cohen's benchmarks. Qualitative analysis of 834 journals highlighted themes of autonomy, support for metacognitive strategies, and reduced anxiety, although risks of superficial application were noted. Mixed methods confirmed AI's effectiveness in enhancing strategic learning. AI applications facilitate independent academic exploration and enhance learners' motivation by providing immediate support and personalized learning experiences. These findings highlight the potential of AI-powered tools to foster learner autonomy. However, successful integration into educational settings requires strategic pedagogical approaches to maximize benefits while addressing potential challenges.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that individuals with low self-esteem tend to undervalue themselves, a tendency that may reflect a metacognitive monitoring bias, which in turn can be shaped by feedback valence. However, research specifically exploring how self-esteem and feedback valence affect metacognitive monitoring remains scarce. Through three experiments, the study revealed that individuals tend to exhibit an underestimation bias in perceptual metacognitive monitoring. However, compared to individuals with high self-esteem, those with low self-esteem exhibited more pronounced local and global monitoring biases in the absence of feedback. Furthermore, feedback valence influenced both local and global metacognitive monitoring in low self-esteem individuals, whereas its effects in high self-esteem individuals were limited to global monitoring. Additionally, feedback valence reduced global monitoring disparities between self-esteem groups, while only positive feedback narrowed the gap in local monitoring. These findings suggest that the influence of feedback valence on metacognitive monitoring biases varies depending on both self-esteem level and the level of monitoring. These results provide valuable insights into the interplay among self-esteem, metacognitive monitoring and feedback, with implications for the development of targeted educational strategies, particularly for individuals with low self-esteem.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mimic human cognition in various language-based tasks. However, their capacity for metacognition-particularly in predicting memory performance-remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a cross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with human judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals predict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs of sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence-a sentence that initially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before requiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting sentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM and human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted actual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy. This discrepancy emerged regardless of whether sentences appeared in fitting or unfitting contexts. These findings indicate that, despite LLMs' demonstrated capacity to model human cognition at the object-level, they struggle at the meta-level, failing to capture the variability in individual memory predictions. By identifying this shortcoming, our study underscores the need for further refinements in LLMs' self-monitoring abilities, which could enhance their utility in educational settings, personalized learning, and human-AI interactions. Strengthening LLMs' metacognitive performance may reduce the reliance on human oversight, paving the way for more autonomous and seamless integration of AI into tasks requiring deeper cognitive awareness.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine how older adults form beliefs about their memory and how these beliefs are influenced by their level of concern about dementia. Inaccurate beliefs and excessive worrying, indicative of erroneous metacognition, are associated with negative health outcomes. This research can help identify mitigation for these harmful effects. Qualitative focus groups; thematic analysis. Focus group discussion with healthy older adults hosted at a university in central London. 35 healthy older individuals (women=29) without any psychiatric or neurological diagnoses, over the age of 65 years (mean 75.31, SD: 6.15). 13 participants were identified as having a high level of worry about dementia and 22 as having low worry. Groups were matched for cognitive performance on the Telephone Mini Addenbrooke's cognitive assessment (Tele-MACE). Participants were assigned to a focus group depending on their level of worry about dementia. During focus groups, a vignette prompted discussion around lifespan changes in memory and how this affected concerns around memory. This allowed investigation of the differences in beliefs about memory. Thematic analysis revealed two key themes. First, older adults appear to base their definition of 'normality' of their own memory on comparisons. These comparisons were between themselves and others and between themselves now and their own past self. Despite similar strategies to define 'normality', those with high dementia worry had stricter definitions of what they determined as normal. The second theme described narratives around the 'self' and the 'other'. There was a difference between those with high versus low worry; those with high worry had a strong focus on the 'self', while those with low dementia worry focused on 'others'. Comparison is a common metacognitive strategy used in forming beliefs about memory. Targeting the use of comparison is potentially valuable in interventions aiming to alleviate older adults' memory concerns. Addressing self-focused thinking, for example, with cognitive behavioural therapy, could improve harmful levels of high worry.",

    "abstract": "Self-reported outcome measures are rarely described in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we investigated the effect of computerized working memory training on self- and relatives reported executive function measures. A total of 50 individuals with MCI were recruited from five memory clinics in Southern Norway and underwent a 5-week/20-25 sessions computerized working memory training program. Both individuals and relatives scored the \"Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults\" (BRIEF-A) before, and at least four months after finalizing training. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and mixed ANOVA with rater type (participant/informant) and time (baseline/4-months). Mixed ANOVA revealed significant (adjusted p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.025) participant-informant x time interactions for Working Memory, Metacognition Index and Global Executive Composite, suggesting that the changes in ratings over time differed between participants and informants. Post hoc tests revealed that at baseline participants rated themselves as significantly more impaired (adjusted p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.036) than informants on the Working Memory scale, the Metacognitive Index and the Global Executive Composite. After training, no significant differences were found between participant and informant reports. After training participants reported significant improvements on Working Memory (adjusted p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038), Metacognition Index (adjusted p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038), with working memory improving from above the established clinically significant impairment threshold to the normal range. The change in Global Executive Composite was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons (adjusted p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.057). No significant changes were found for relatives' reported scores between the two time points. Excluding participants developing dementia during the study enhanced the difference in mean values before and after the intervention for these outcomes. Computerized working memory training significantly improved self-reported executive function in individuals with MCI. While informant reports remained stable, the prior significant discrepancy between self- and informant ratings converged after training due to this improvement. These findings suggest that training can enhance subjective cognitive experience and awareness, offering potential clinical benefits for individuals with MCI.

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the influencing factors of smartphone addiction among university students and further examine the mediating role of metacognition in the relationship between anxiety elements and smartphone addiction. Researchers conducted a structured questionnaire survey on 736 university students from three universities(Hunan University of Science and Technology, Anhui University of Finance &amp; Economics, and Hunan Normal University), measuring their self-reported responses on six constructs: academic anxiety, social anxiety, future anxiety, positive metacognition, negative metacognition, and smartphone addiction. The study interpreted the non-compensatory and non-linear relationships between predictors and smartphone addiction by applying the Structural Equation Modeling - Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) method. The findings revealed that academic anxiety had no significant impact on smartphone addiction, nor did social and future anxiety on positive metacognition and social anxiety on negative metacognition. Furthermore, positive metacognition did not play a mediating role between anxiety and smartphone addiction, nor did negative metacognition between social anxiety and smartphone addiction. The remaining hypotheses were validated. Additionally, according to the normalized importance derived from the multilayer perceptron, the study identified the most critical predictive factor as negative metacognition (100%), followed by future anxiety (49.19%), social anxiety (29.52%), positive metacognition (16.51%), and academic anxiety (10.73%). Lastly, the study presents theoretical and practical implications regarding smartphone addiction among university students.",

    "abstract": "Self-explanation (SE), an individual learning strategy for the development of clinical reasoning skills, has been implemented in undergraduate medical curricula. A tool for documenting students' appropriate use of SE is needed to ensure benefit on learning. The objective of this project was to develop such a tool and report on evidence of its validity. We used DeVellis's eight steps to develop the tool. Assessors applied the tool to 85 audio-recorded SEs. We calculated students' mean number of inferences (biomedical, clinical, monitoring) and case elements used when self-explaining to document validity evidence of content. We used interrater agreement, with intraclass correlation coefficients, to document validity evidence of response processes. Three assessors documented the students' use of SE with the tool. They found means of 13.33 to 17.76 biomedical inferences, 16.27 to 27.04 clinical inferences, 2.03 to 3.10 monitoring statements, and listed 21.77 to 26.87 case elements. Interrater reliability varied from 0.53 to 0.96. We developed the tool using the principles underlying SE. The way students used SE aligned with our expectations. Assessors used the tool in a consistent way. The tool could document students' use of SE in experimental or educational contexts.

    "abstract": "People often use external tools to offload cognitive demands associated with remembering future intentions. While previous research has established a causal role of metacognition in cognitive offloading, the neural basis of white matter tracts supporting this metacognitive control process remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a study with 34 participants using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine how white matter connectivity supports metacognition driven cognitive offloading. Behaviorally, we replicated prior findings showing that under-confidence in internal memory predicts a bias toward using external reminders. At the neural level, we used diffusion tensor imaging to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of microstructural integrity in white matter. We found the microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum bundle (CB) predicted deviations from the optimal use of reminders. The microstructural integrity of the fornix negatively predicted participants' confidence in performing the task when restricted to internal memory. Our findings reveal the microstructural organization of the white-matter tracts in the fronto-temporal-parietal network are related to metacognition driven cognitive offloading. We discuss several aspects of metacognition driven cognitive offloading from a white matter microstructural perspective.",

    "abstract": "The primate brain excels at transforming photons into knowledge. When light strikes the back of the eye, opsin molecules within rods and cones absorb photons, triggering a change in membrane potential. This energy transfer initiates a cascade of neural events that endows us with useful knowledge. This knowledge manifests as subjectively experienced perceptual interpretations and mostly pertains to the 3D structure of the visual environment and the affordances of the objects within the scene. However, some of this knowledge instead pertains to the quality of these interpretations and contributes to our sense of confidence in perceptual decisions. Because such confidence reflects knowledge about knowledge, psychologists consider this the domain of metacognition. Here, we examine what is known about the neuronal basis of perceptual decision confidence, with a focus on vision. We review the crucial computational processes and neural operations that underlie and constrain the transformation of photons into visual metacognition.",

Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: a) no AI input (control group), b) AI prediction only, and c) AI prediction with explanation.

    "abstract": "Physicians sometimes encounter various types of gut feelings (GFs) during clinical diagnosis. The type of GF addressed in this paper refers to the intuitive sense that the generated hypothesis might be incorrect. An appropriate diagnosis cannot be obtained unless these GFs are articulated and inventive solutions are devised. Thus, the method of articulating GFs is critical. The current study proposes reflective verbalization (RV) to help healthcare professionals capitalize on their GF. In cognitive psychology, RV is the process of verbalizing one's thoughts and feelings through metacognition, to promote deeper understanding and insight problem-solving. When applied to clinical reasoning, RV can help doctors verbalize their GFs, refining their diagnostic hypotheses. To address GFs systematically using RV, we introduce the DATES approach, comprising five perspectives: Degree, Abandoned, Time course, Excess, and Shortage. Each perspective prompts physicians to compare their patient's information against typical illness scripts, ensuring no detail is omitted or overlooked. The tool also aids physicians in considering possible differential diagnoses for one or more of these elements. This guiding tool may aid physicians in overcoming biases, including confirmation and anchoring biases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy. This tool is useful for healthcare professionals who wish to improve their clinical reasoning and decision-making abilities, particularly when they encounter inexplicable contradictions in their diagnostic hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Generative activity can interfere with later retrieval of related concepts and words. This semantic interference has been ascribed to long-term adaptive learning mechanisms that promote access to selected representations and hinder access to coactivated competitors. Some accounts in the memory literature posit that the punishment doled out to coactivated competitors may actually serve as a catalyst for more robust relearning in comparison to never-punished controls. The present work investigates whether this claim also applies to lexical access by assessing how adaptive learning processes unfold during generation of taxonomically related words in each phase of a modified retrieval practice and relearning design. In each phase, there was cumulative semantic interference across category member ordinal position, demonstrating that interference accrues with each related retrieval. The final assessment phase showed persistent semantic interference in the absence of relearning, but naming was equivalent for activated and control conditions that were subjected to relearning. These results provide a detailed window into the temporal dynamics of learning and relearning in conceptual-lexical access but suggest that enhanced relearning chiefly applies to novel learning episodes and not well learned conceptual-lexical links.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents' metacognitive skills and social relationships play key roles in learning but are often studied in isolation. This study investigated the links between metacognition, learning performance, and classroom friendship networks in a sample of 136 seventh-grade students from Switzerland (53.8% female; mean age 13.8&#x2009;years) assessed at two time points 3&#x2009;months apart. Metacognition was measured on-task. Monitoring was assessed through confidence judgments, and control through decisions about what to restudy and which responses to submit or withdraw from grading. Participants learned the meanings of Japanese characters (\"Kanji\"), self-tested memorization, monitored their performance, made restudy decisions, and submitted selected responses. Social friendship networks were measured with friendship nominations within classrooms. Results showed that decision accuracy strongly predicted Kanji task scores at both time points. Monitoring-based restudy became a significant predictor of task scores at the second measurement, indicating that participants who strategically restudied items for which confidence was initially low achieved higher scores. No evidence was found for friends influencing adolescents' metacognitive skills. Friends did, however, become more similar in task performance over time, suggesting that peer influence may shape learning processes other than the investigated metacognitive processes. These findings highlight the importance of metacognitive control and friendship dynamics for adolescents' learning outcomes.",

However, few studies have elucidated the neural underpinnings of different metacognition subdimensions. Additionally, the relationship between these functional neural bases and longitudinal changes in individual emotional distresses remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 180 college students completed brain imaging and a battery of behavioral assessments. Employing the connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), we delineated the functional connectivity (FC) network of each metacognition subdimension. Then, the mediation model was used to explore the relationships between FC networks, metacognition subdimensions, and emotional distresses. <b>Results:</b> Default mode network (DMN) was found to be the general network of three significant subdimensions. Specifically, the FC network of cognitive self-consciousness (CSC) was scattered and mainly relied on DMN and frontoparietal network; need to control thoughts (NC) was largely consisted of the correlates between DMN and ventral attention network (VAN); negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger of worry (NEG) was primarily associated with DMN and its correlates with visual network. CSC, NC, and NEG could mediate the relationship between the corresponding FC network and emotional distresses. Additionally, the CSC related and NEG related FCs could effectively predict the change of anxiety positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings demonstrated the common and distinct FC bases of maladaptive metacognition. The excessive FCs of CSC and NEG might be responsible for impaired self-check-related ability and further increase the risk of several affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are overrepresented among individuals with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We aimed to study the prevalence of ASD symptoms in extremely undernourished inpatients with AN and focus on potential cognitive and nutritional correlates. We recruited prospectively all extremely undernourished patients with AN admitted to the Nutritional Care Unit of Paul Brousse Hospital over four months. ASD traits and AN psychopathology were assessed by administering the Autism Quotient (AQ) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2). Neuropsychological and bio-nutritional data were also collected. Among 33 participants aged 25.5&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;9.3 (91&#xa0;% females, BMI: 12.1&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.4), 12&#xa0;% scored above the clinical cut-off on the AQ. Independently of age and BMI, EDI-2 scores were significantly correlated with AQ-total scores (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.62; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01), higher levels of cognitive rigidity (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.61; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and sensory sensitivity alterations (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.69; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01). In the cross-sectional model, the AQ-communication domain, and the GSQ-hyposensitivity scale were significant predictors (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.5) of the variance in EDI-2 scores. Negative beliefs and cognitive confidence were associated with lower levels of Transthyretin (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.02). ASD traits presented high prevalence in extremely undernourished patients with AN. Despite the impact that malnutrition can have on cognitive functioning, most of these traits appear to be independent of BMI but associated with the severity of eating psychopathology; only Transthyretin was associated with dysfunctional metacognitions. These preliminary results suggest that ASD symptoms might co-occur in severe AN and require specific therapeutic interventions.",

We conducted an anonymous online survey among the Korean general population. The scale development involved the following process: 1) defining the purpose of developing the scale, 2) generating appropriate items, 3) reducing redundant items, 4) conducting psychometric tests and further reducing items, and 5) developing the final version of the scale. Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the scale were evaluated, and convergent validity was examined using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-6 items (DBAS-6), and Metacognition Questionnaire-Insomnia-6 items (MCQI-6). The final six items extracted through exploratory factor analysis were clustered into two factors: adaptive sleep-related cognitions and behaviors. Model fit indices (comparative fit index&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.96, Tucker-Lewis index&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.93, root mean square error of approximation&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.06, and standardized root mean square residual&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.04) supported the two-factor structure of the scale in confirmatory factor analysis. The Adaptive Cognition and Behaviors about Sleep-6 (ACBS-6) demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (McDonald's omega&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.734). Linear regression analysis revealed that the DBAS-6 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.50, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) and MCQI-6 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.22, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) positively contributed to the ISI score, whereas ACBS-6 (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.07, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.041) inversely contributed to the ISI score. The ACBS-6 exhibits acceptable reliability and strong structural validity, supporting its two-factor model of adaptive sleep-related cognitions and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of the MathByExample intervention, which integrates worked examples and self-explanation prompts into math worksheets to address 4th and 5th graders' misconceptions. Researchers conducted a year-long, classroom-based experiment in 58 U.S. classrooms, randomly assigning classrooms to experimental or control conditions. The study explored the intervention's impact on algebra readiness and the moderating effects of prior knowledge and intervention dosage. Results showed no significant overall impact of the intervention on foundational algebra knowledge (FAK) or preparation for future learning (PFL). However, further analysis provided key insights. For FAK scores, greater self-explanation prompt attempts improved learning, but only when students engaged with a high number of worksheets. Students with higher prior knowledge experienced a negative effect of attempting more worksheets, suggesting they may not benefit from excessive practice. Self-explanation attempts had a stronger positive effect for students with higher prior knowledge. For PFL scores, self-explanation attempts significantly improved PFL scores, but only for students with at least average prior knowledge, with the strongest effects seen in those completing more worksheets. These findings suggest that educators may benefit from actively incorporating the study and explanation of worked examples into elementary math instruction. To maximize their impact, teachers should regularly integrate worked examples into their lessons. Encouraging students to engage with worked examples through self-explanation may mitigate common misconceptions and enhance students' readiness for more advanced algebra concepts.",

    "abstract": "Testing enhances memory more than studying. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the robustness of this classic effect, its neural and computational origin remains debated. Predictive learning is a potential mechanism behind this phenomenon: Because predictions and prediction errors (mismatch between predictions and feedback) are more likely to be generated in testing (relative to in studying), testing can benefit more from predictive learning. We shed light on the testing effect from a multilevel analysis perspective via a combination of cognitive neuroscience experiments (fMRI) and computational modeling. Behaviorally and computationally, only a model incorporating predictive learning can account for the full breadth of behavioral patterns and the robust testing effect. At the neural level, testing and prediction error both activate the canonical reward-related brain areas in the ventral striatum, insula, and midbrain. Crucially, back sorting analysis revealed that activation in the ventral striatum, insula, and midbrain can enhance declarative memory. These results provide strong and converging evidence for a predictive learning account of the testing effect.",

By analyzing structural MRI data and metacognitive measures, it investigates how brain volume variations correlate with dysfunctional beliefs and OCD symptoms. The study consisted of 20 patients with OCD and 20 healthy controls. Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Scale (Y-BOCS), Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were administered to OCD patients and healthy controls. They then underwent structural MRI scans to measure the volume of the OFC and thalamus. On both sides, OCD patients had smaller volumes of OFC than healthy control individuals, and their thalamic volumes were similar to those of the control participants. Furthermore, MCQ-30 scores showed a substantial negative correlation with left OFC volume. In conclusion, we suggest that dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs might be related to the occurrence of OCD, and these beliefs might be associated with the left side of OFC neuroanatomically.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition that can impair both physical and cognitive impairments. The aim of this study, to compare physical activity (PA) levels, cognitive flexibility, metacognition and attention skills between individuals with MS and healthy individuals and to examine the relationship between PA and cognitive flexibility, metacognition and attention skills. The comparison of these abilities with healthy individuals enables the identification of MS-related functional deficits and supports the development of appropriate intervention programs. This cross-sectional study consisted of two groups. The study group included 35 individuals with relapsing remitting type MS who were diagnosed with MS by a neurologist. The control group included 33 healthy volunteers. Both groups were evaluated in terms of demographic information, PA level (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), cognitive flexibility (The Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI)), metacognition (The Metacognitions-30 Scale (MCS-30)) and attention (Stroop test-TBAG Form (STT) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) status of the participants. The differences between the two groups regarding these parameters were assessed, and their relationship with PA level in individuals with MS was examined. The two groups were similar in terms of age, gender and body mass index (p&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05). Compared to healthy controls, individuals with MS had lower IPAQ score and CFI scores (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and higher scores on MCS-30 (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Individuals with MS had higher STT and TMT completion times than healthy individuals in all sections (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). There was a low statistically significant negative correlation between the IPAQ scores of individuals with MS and the completion times of the fourth and fifth parts of the Stroop Test (r=-0.364, -0.402; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). PA level, cognitive flexibility, metacognition and attention are negatively affected in individuals with MS. Therefore, in addition to routine assessments, it is important to perform detailed PA level and cognitive assessment in individuals with MS in order to plan rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Adversities suffered at an early age lead to negative long-term effects impacting the development of the emotional, social, and cognitive domains of the personality, including metacognitive skills. We aimed to investigate the mediating role of metacognition in the impact exercised by early adversities on trait anxiety. Participants (all over 18) were recruited from the general population (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;304). Adverse childhood experiences were assessed using the 10-item Adverse Childhood Questionnaire, for the assessment of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs the Meta-Cognitions Questionnaire was applied, while the level of the trait anxiety was investigated using the Trait Version of the State-Trait Anxiety inventory. To examine the mediating effect of metacognition between early adversities and trait anxiety mediation analysis was used. Adverse childhood experiences have a moderate effect on trait anxiety (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.348, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). More than half of the revealed associations were shown to be due to the maladaptive functioning of metacognition (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;56.03&#xa0;%). As regards specific maladaptive metacognitive beliefs, it was found that negative metacognitive beliefs (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;61.49&#xa0;%), the need to control thoughts (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;46.0&#xa0;%), and the lack of cognitive confidence (Pm&#xa0;=&#xa0;30.07&#xa0;%) play a crucial role in the mediating effect of metacognition. We can assume that the overall negative impact of early adversities on development is also manifested by the inadequacy of metacognition, which contributes to anxiety proneness. This inadequacy leads to the development of maladaptive metacognitive beliefs that prevent proper monitoring and correcting of the individual's internal contents, further increasing the level of trait-like anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.",

    "abstract": "To explore what factors are considered in making an entrustment decision about a provisionally registered (intern) pharmacist from the perspectives of registered and intern pharmacists. Registered and intern pharmacists in Australia were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. The survey included open-ended, free-text questions exploring the factors influencing entrustment decisions for three Entrustable Professional Activities developed by the Australian Pharmacy Council for use in workplace-based assessments of intern pharmacists: dispensing medicines, compounding pharmaceutical products, and providing medication counselling. Qualitative data were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis approach to identify key themes and subthemes influencing entrustment decisions. Of the 302 respondents (220 registered pharmacists and 82 interns), 215 participants provided qualitative responses. Analysis revealed four major themes: (1) Intern's competency and skill proficiency, with emphasis on technical knowledge, task execution, and interpersonal skills; (2) Intern's self-awareness and metacognition, including receptiveness to feedback and reflective practice; (3) Entrustment process dynamics, highlighting task complexity, contextual risk, and supervisor trust propensity; and (4) Barriers to and opportunities for establishing entrustment practices that guide entrustment decisions. Supervisors reported relying on team-based perspectives to inform entrustment decisions. Entrustment decision-making is a multifaceted process shaped by intern characteristics, task complexity, and contextual dynamics. In addition to technical competence, metacognitive capabilities and reflective practice were identified as critical to fostering more autonomy in practice. Variability in supervisors' trust propensity and entrustment practices highlights the need to strengthen entrustment practices to enhance consistency in how decisions are made and to support effective use of Entrustable Professional Activities in workplace-based pharmacy education.",

    "abstract": "We examined the association between metacognitive performance, functioning, and quality of life (QoL) in schizophrenia using structural equation model analyses. A sample of 249 participants was assessed for symptoms, functioning, QoL, and both objective and subjective cognitive performance. Metacognitive performance was defined as the adequation between objective and subjective measures of cognitive performance. Our model showed an excellent fit (CFI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.981; RMSEA&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014-0.081) and explained 53.3&#xa0;% of the variance in functioning and 50.3&#xa0;% in QoL. Metacognitive performance was not significantly associated with functioning but showed a negative association with QoL (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.383, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Thus, a greater underestimation of one's cognitive abilities was linked with lower QoL, potentially reflecting heightened awareness of deficits that affect well-being. Depression, also negatively associated with QoL (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.359, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), was linked to the underestimation of cognitive abilities, whereas symptom severity was associated with their overestimation (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.296, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Complementary analyses suggest that the subjective cognition model closely mirrors that of metacognitive performance, questioning the distinctiveness of metacognition as an explanatory factor in schizophrenia outcomes. Our findings imply that interventions that boost confidence in cognitive abilities, such as cognitive remediation, may improve QoL. Future research should investigate the causal pathways between these factors and explore the role of social cognition, often impaired in schizophrenia, as another mediator. Comprehensive treatment that addresses clinical symptoms, depression, and subjective cognition challenges appear essential to improve outcomes in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Aphasia, particularly in persons with nonfluent aphasia (PWNA), disrupts speech fluency. Script treatment-delivered with recursive self-feedback (RSF) or external feedback (EF)-has been shown to improve fluency in PWNA. Evidence from anomia treatment suggests that structured practice schedule (continuous vs. discontinuous) may further influence outcomes. However, it remains unknown how feedback type and PWNA's self-selected practice schedules-reflecting the variability of real-life routines-interact to influence language outcomes. This study introduces a novel self-selected practice schedule approach and examines its interaction with feedback type on speech fluency in PWNA. Using a cross-over design, four PWNA engaged in script production with RSF or EF over two intensive treatment blocks. They practiced for two hours daily across two to three weeks per block. The outcome metrics were speaking rate and speech initiation latency. Flexible practice schedules were allowed, where participants selected between continuous (intensive) or discontinuous (spaced) practice across sessions during each treatment block. Approximately 25,000 speech samples, collected across both treatments' sessions, were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. RSF showed a slower gradual increase in speaking rate over time but greater improvement in speech initiation latency than EF over the course of treatment. The discontinuous practice schedule was associated with significantly greater gains in both outcome metrics. Discontinuous practice schedule particularly influenced improvement in speaking rate during script production with RSF. By introducing self-selected practice scheduling, this work advances more ecologically valid and personalized models of aphasia intervention. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that a discontinuous, spaced practice schedule may be particularly well-suited for RSF and other errorful-based approaches in promoting language recovery in real-world context. Future research with larger and diverse samples of persons with aphasia should test this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this meta-analysis is to give an overview of the relationships between positive and negative metacognitions (PMC, NMC) with health anxiety and pathological safety seeking and avoidant behavior (SSB, AB). The preregistered systematic literature screening included following data bases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses, and The German National Library. The studies were evaluated based on predefined eligibility criteria (i.e., data for PMC/NMC and health anxiety and/ or SSB/AB from adult samples, assessed with validated inventories and presented in English or German language) and risk of bias categories. Correlation coefficients were aggregated with random effect models. Publication biases were estimated with contour enhanced funnel plots and outlier analyses. 23 studies (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;9229) were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies assessed health anxiety in analogue samples. A significant medium effect was found for PMC and health anxiety (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;.36, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001, 95% CI:.29&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;r&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;.43), whereas for NMC the effect was large (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;.52, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001, 95% CI:.46&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;r&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;.58). For the relationship with SSB the results revealed a moderate effect for PMC (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004; 95%-CI: 0.19&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;r&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.42) and a small effect for NMC (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;.25, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.02, 95% CI:.05&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;r&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;.43). No study assessed AB. Metacognitions are a significant pathological factor in health anxiety, with particularly strong association with NMC. PMC might be of special interest for health anxiety and SSB compared to other psychopathologies. Heterogeneity, missing clinical samples and studies on AB limit generalizability. Future research should further explore the role of metacognitions in health anxiety and focus on the relation with pathological SSB and AB.",

However, the specific impact of emotion regulation on the retrieval practice effects, particularly covert and overt formats, remains unclear. This study conducted three experiments to investigate how two commonly used emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) affect the covert and overt retrieval practice effects. In Experiment 1, a modified retrieval practice paradigm was employed with a 3 (emotion regulation strategy: cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, control) &#xd7; 2 (learning condition: retrieval practice vs. restudy) mixed-design. The results revealed that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression differentially affected the retrieval practice effect. Moreover, Experiments 2 and 3 investigated how different emotion regulation strategies influence the effects of both overt and covert retrieval practice. The results not only replicated the findings from Experiment 1 but also revealed that cognitive reappraisal effectively mitigated the disruptive effects of negative emotion on both overt and covert retrieval practice. In sum, cognitive reappraisal was a successful emotion regulation strategy that improved retrieval practice processes.",

    "abstract": "Whether and how metacognition is altered in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is intensely debated. Metacognitive deficit is claimed to be related to cognitive inflexibility, accounting for restrictive behaviors in ASD individuals. We wanted to test this hypothesis by measuring metacognition in ASD and in matched neurotypically developing (TD) control samples in a task that relies on visuo-spatial cognition, in which ASD allegedly have an advantage. We measured metacognition in a 3D mental rotation task. Additionally, we administered a trading game: players had to figure out the rules for maximizing the profit on each transaction. These rules changed in the middle of the game, which required that players modify their strategy to keep the profit at maximum. We measured both learning efficiency (how fast players extract the rules) and re-learning speed (cognitive flexibility, how fast learners could adjust their behavioral responses after rules are changed). TD outperform ASD individuals in terms of accuracy in mental rotation but exhibited lower metacognitive efficiency (i.e., were less aware when they were more likely to make an error). No differences in learning efficiency and cognitive flexibility between TD and ASD individuals were observed. Neither did we observe an association between cognitive flexibility and metacognition. Nevertheless, both in ASD and TD populations, overconfidence in one's decisions is negatively correlated with cognitive flexibility, but not with learning efficiency. ASD individuals can have superior metacognition in tasks that rely on visuo-spatial cognition. Cognitive flexibility is diminished by overconfidence, not by metacognitive deficit.",
