      "choices": [
        "The multidisciplinary approach focuses exclusively on the physiological causes of pain.",
        "The multidisciplinary approach integrates psychological and functional goals alongside pain reduction, while a unimodal approach is often narrower.",
        "The unimodal approach always results in faster and more complete pain relief.",
        "The multidisciplinary approach avoids any medical interventions."
      ],
      "answer_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Multidisciplinary pain treatment differentiates itself by holistically addressing not only the physical aspects but also the psychological and social factors that perpetuate chronic pain, setting functional goals beyond mere pain reduction. In contrast, unimodal medical approaches often focus on singular interventions, potentially overlooking the broader impact of pain on a patient's life (Gatchel & Weisberg, 2008).",
