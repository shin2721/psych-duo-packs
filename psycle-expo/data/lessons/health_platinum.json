    "explanation": "Descartes theorized that the pineal gland, being a singular, undoubled organ in the brain, was the principal seat of the soul and the point of interaction between the mind and body. This was his solution to the problem of how two distinct substances could influence each other.",

      "The HPA axis has become hyper-responsive, leading to an overproduction of cortisol.",
      "The body has developed a robust tolerance to stress, making it more resilient.",

    "explanation": "Research often indicates that *perceived* social support (the belief that support is available if needed) is more consistently and strongly linked to positive adjustment outcomes than *received* social support (actual acts of support provided). This highlights the importance of an individual's subjective experience of support availability.",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Small-diameter C and A-delta nerve fibers are responsible for transmitting noxious (painful) stimuli. Their activity increases the excitability of transmission (T) cells in the spinal cord, which effectively 'opens the gate' to allow more pain signals to ascend to the brain.",

    "explanation": "Non-noxious sensory input, such as rubbing, activates large-diameter nerve fibers. These fibers, in turn, stimulate inhibitory interneurons in the substantia gelatinosa, which leads to the closing of the spinal gate and a reduction in the transmission of pain signals.",

    "answer_index": 2,

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "A strong pain signal is transmitted when small-diameter (pain-transmitting) fibers are highly active, while the large-diameter (inhibitory) fibers have minimal activity, and there is an absence of descending inhibition from the brain. This combination would maximally 'open the gate' at the spinal cord level, allowing more pain signals to reach the brain.",
