    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer's core argument challenges traditional economic views by demonstrating that money is not simply a neutral, interchangeable medium.

    "correct_answer": "earmarking",
    "explanation": "Earmarking is the process by which individuals and groups mentally or formally assign specific purposes to different sums of money. This act limits money's fungibility, meaning funds designated for one purpose are not readily interchangeable with others.",

These replicas are identical to the originals in every way, except they don't carry the brand's official stamp. If you could buy these replicas at a fraction of the original price, how would the demand for *authentic* luxury goods change, specifically for those who buy them to signal status?",
    "explanation": "If luxury goods can be perfectly and unobservably replicated, they lose their ability to reliably signal genuine wealth and exclusivity.

    "explanation": "While financial dependence might offer temporary relief from immediate financial pressures, it often leads to profound negative emotional consequences for the dependent individual. These can include feelings of shame, guilt, resentment, and a diminished sense of self-worth or competence due to the lack of financial autonomy.",

    "question": "Considering the transition to digital economies, how might the psychological 'fungibility' of money—its interchangeability—be psychologically altered, and what could be a complex consequence?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Digital money becomes less fungible, leading to more deliberate spending on specific categories.",
      "B. The perception of fungibility might increase due to seamless digital transfers, potentially blurring spending categories and financial boundaries.",
      "C. Fungibility will be entirely removed, as all digital money will be 'earmarked' for specific uses by default.",
      "D. Individuals will psychologically assign more distinct values to different digital units, reducing overall spending."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "While money is inherently fungible, its digital form can psychologically increase the perception of its interchangeability due to seamless transfers and less 'friction' between different accounts or purposes. This ease can blur mental accounting categories, potentially making it harder to track money allocated for specific goals versus general spending.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Implement mental accounting strategies even with digital money. Use separate virtual envelopes or categories in budgeting apps to designate funds for specific goals (e.g., 'rent,' 'savings,' 'fun money') to counteract the blurring effect.",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "A complex psychological trade-off arises where individuals must weigh the significant benefits of convenience, efficiency, and financial inclusion offered by digital economies against concerns about relinquishing personal autonomy and privacy. The ease of digital financial services often comes with increased data collection and the potential for surveillance, requiring a mental calculus of acceptable risk for perceived reward.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Engage in informed decision-making. Before adopting a new digital financial service, research its privacy policy and data security measures. Prioritize services that offer transparency and user control over data.",

      "D) Consistently act against their own self-interest."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Bounded rationality recognizes that human decision-making is constrained by cognitive limitations, such as finite attention, memory, and processing power. This leads to 'good enough' rather than perfectly optimal choices.",

      "C) Anchoring effect.",
      "D) Hyperbolic discounting."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Prospect theory posits that individuals feel the pain of losses more acutely than the pleasure of equivalent gains, a phenomenon known as loss aversion. This often leads to risk-seeking behavior in the domain of losses and risk-averse behavior in the domain of gains.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: When considering an investment, define your stop-loss points *before* you invest. This pre-commitment can help counteract the tendency to hold onto losing assets too long due to loss aversion.",

    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Present bias, often modeled by hyperbolic discounting, describes the tendency for people to disproportionately prefer immediate rewards over future rewards, even if the future reward is significantly larger. This inconsistency over time can lead to procrastination and self-control issues.",

    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Such policies, often termed 'nudges,' utilize the power of defaults to steer individuals towards beneficial outcomes without restricting their choices. People are often slow to change from a default option, making it an effective tool for policy-makers.",

      "D) Policy-makers would consistently choose policies that minimize long-term financial costs."
    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "The availability heuristic causes people to overestimate the probability of events that are easily brought to mind, often due to their vividness or recency. This can lead policy-makers to prioritize addressing highly publicized or dramatic risks over more common but less salient threats.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Before reacting to recent news or vivid stories, seek out broader statistical data and expert analysis. This helps counter the availability heuristic and make more rational decisions, especially in investing.",

    "correct_answer": "True",
    "explanation": "Standard economics often constructs normative models, detailing how rational agents *ought* to behave to achieve optimal outcomes. Behavioral economics emphasizes descriptive models, which seek to understand and explain how people *actually* make decisions, often revealing systematic deviations from those normative ideals, which is crucial for effective policy design.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: When evaluating economic proposals or advice, identify whether it's based on how people *should* ideally act or how they *actually* behave. This helps you understand its practical applicability and limitations.",

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Libertarian paternalism acknowledges that while nudges preserve freedom of choice (libertarian aspect), they are still intentionally designed to influence behavior towards what the 'nudge' designer considers beneficial (paternalistic aspect). Critics question the ethics and potential for manipulation when governments subtly guide individuals' decisions.",
