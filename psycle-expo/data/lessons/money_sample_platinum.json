    "correct_answer": "False",
    "explanation": "Contrary to traditional economic assumptions, money psychology posits that financial decisions are frequently swayed by emotions, cognitive biases, personal history, and subjective meanings, rather than being purely rational. These influences lead to diverse and sometimes irrational behaviors.",

      "It primarily determines one's inherited wealth, not their spending habits.",
      "It shapes enduring money scripts, attitudes, and emotional responses that guide adult decisions.",
      "Its effects are entirely overridden by formal financial education in adulthood."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Early experiences and observations about money during childhood significantly contribute to the formation of 'money scripts' and deeply ingrained attitudes, which then powerfully influence adult financial behaviors, sometimes unconsciously. These foundational beliefs are often resistant to change.",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Impulsive spending is often driven by emotional factors, serving as a coping mechanism or an attempt at emotional regulation, such as seeking immediate gratification, alleviating stress, or dealing with feelings of sadness or boredom. It's less about rational choice and more about immediate psychological relief.",

    "correct_answer": "Mental Accounting",
    "explanation": "Mental accounting describes how individuals categorize and treat money differently based on its perceived origin or purpose, leading to inconsistent financial decisions even when the objective value is the same. For example, people might be more willing to spend a bonus than money from their regular salary.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Review your budget and try to treat all your income as fungible, regardless of its source (e.g., salary, bonus, gift). This can help you make more objective spending and saving decisions.",

    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Research generally indicates that increased income significantly improves subjective well-being by meeting basic needs and providing security, but these gains tend to diminish or plateau once a comfortable income level is reached. Beyond this point, other factors like relationships and purpose become more critical for happiness.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Once your basic financial needs are met, prioritize experiences, personal growth, and strong relationships over accumulating more material wealth for sustained happiness.",

    ],
    "answer_index": 3,
    "explanation": "While not universal, the 'psychology of affluence' suggests that great wealth can sometimes lead to psychological difficulties like isolation, distrust, increased social comparison, and a reduced sense of empathy. The idea that wealth automatically increases empathy or generosity is often contradicted by research indicating a complex relationship between wealth and prosocial behavior.",

    "explanation": "Cultural values and norms play a crucial role in shaping an individual's financial socialization, influencing their attitudes towards saving, spending, debt, risk-taking, and the symbolic meaning attributed to money. These cultural frameworks lead to diverse financial behaviors and priorities across societies.",

    "choices": [
      "Money is a purely neutral and fungible medium of exchange.",
      "Money's meaning is primarily determined by its intrinsic material value.",
      "Money is deeply embedded in social relations and carries diverse cultural and moral meanings.",
      "The psychological impact of money is solely dependent on an individual's net worth."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer's core argument challenges traditional economic views by demonstrating that money is not simply a neutral, interchangeable medium. Instead, its meaning and use are shaped by social contexts, moral frameworks, and cultural practices. This makes money far more complex than a mere economic instrument.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Reflect on a recent purchase or gift. Did the source or context of that money influence how you felt about spending or receiving it? Recognize the social meaning you attach to different funds.",

    "question": "According to Zelizer, the concept of '_______' money primarily suggests people mentally designate specific funds for particular uses, limiting their fungibility.",
    "correct_answer": "earmarking",
    "explanation": "Earmarking, as described by Zelizer, is the process by which individuals and groups mentally or formally assign specific purposes to different sums of money. This act limits money's fungibility, meaning that funds designated for one purpose are not readily interchangeable with funds designated for another, even if they are monetarily equal.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: When budgeting, consider 'earmarking' funds for specific goals (e.g., 'vacation money,' 'education fund'). This can make managing finances feel more intentional and less fungible.",

      "She suggests that economic models accurately capture money's social complexities."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Traditional economics often treats money as a perfectly fungible and neutral tool for exchange. Zelizer directly challenges this by illustrating how social and cultural contexts imbue money with different meanings, making it non-fungible in many real-world social applications.",
    "actionable_advice": "💡 Try this: Observe how people treat different types of money in their lives. Do they act as if a dollar earned from a hard job is the same as a dollar found on the street or given as a gift?",

    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Zelizer demonstrates that people categorize and differentiate between various types of money based on its source, purpose, or symbolic meaning. This leads to distinct rules for how these 'special monies' can be spent or saved, reflecting underlying social and moral norms rather than purely economic logic.",

      "Social relations only affect non-monetary exchanges."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer argues that the social context and relationships between individuals profoundly shape how money is perceived and utilized. For example, money exchanged between family members often carries different expectations and meanings than money exchanged in a commercial transaction.",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Moralizing money involves attaching ethical judgments or social rules to its acquisition, possession, or expenditure. Refusing money from an 'unclean' or illicit source demonstrates that money's moral origins can significantly influence its acceptability and meaning, regardless of its purchasing power.",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer's work highlights that differentiating money helps maintain social order and moral distinctions. If all money were perfectly interchangeable, the social and moral boundaries people impose on 'blood money,' 'gift money,' or 'dirty money' would collapse, blurring important social categories.",

    "correct_answer": "True",
    "explanation": "Zelizer emphasizes that the source and context of money heavily influence its meaning and use. Gift money often comes with sentimental value, social expectations, or a sense of obligation to the giver, distinguishing it from the 'free' and fungible nature often associated with earned wages.",
