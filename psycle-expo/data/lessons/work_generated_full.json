Based on Herzberg's theory, which statement best describes the employees' likely experience?",
    "choices": [
      "They will be highly satisfied due to excellent pay and conditions, overlooking the task nature.",
      "They will be highly dissatisfied because the task nature outweighs all other benefits.",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "The excellent pay, safety equipment, and lenient supervisor are strong hygiene factors, preventing dissatisfaction. However, highly repetitive tasks, minimal feedback, and no decision-making input signify a severe lack of motivators. Herzberg argues that good hygiene only prevents dissatisfaction, and the absence of motivators leads to a state of 'no satisfaction' and low motivation, rather than active dissatisfaction (Herzberg, 1968).",

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Super's life-space concept highlights the interaction of multiple life roles (worker, parent, citizen, etc.).

    "explanation": "Autor (2015) uses the 'O-ring' theory to explain how improvements in technology or one component of production can dramatically increase the value of other, particularly high-skilled, components. This highlights how automation, by handling routine tasks, raises the productivity and demand for human skills in non-routine, complementary tasks.",

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Autor (2015) emphasizes that machines excel at following explicit rules but struggle with tasks requiring common sense, intuition, and the ability to generalize or transfer knowledge across diverse contexts.
