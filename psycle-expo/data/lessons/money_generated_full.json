    "explanation": "Earmarking, as described by Zelizer, is the process by which individuals and groups mentally or formally assign specific purposes to different sums of money.

    "explanation": "Traditional economic theory assumes money is fungible, meaning any dollar is interchangeable with another. Mental accounting directly challenges this by showing individuals categorize money into separate mental accounts (e.g., for rent, entertainment, savings), which influences how it's spent or saved, leading to behaviors inconsistent with perfect fungibility (Thaler, 1985).",

    "explanation": "This scenario highlights the 'hot' (emotional/consummatory) versus 'cool' (cognitive/abstract) system at play. Even with an understanding of the stock's potential, the immediate, tangible nature of $1,000 cash can exert a stronger pull than the abstract, delayed, and slightly uncertain value of stock shares. The 'hot' properties of the immediate cash make it difficult to engage the 'cool' processing required for optimal long-term choice (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989).",

In a financial context, low perceived predictability (uncertain job security) can erode trust in future rewards, making immediate gratification more appealing as individuals may not believe the larger, later reward will materialize or be accessible (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989).",
