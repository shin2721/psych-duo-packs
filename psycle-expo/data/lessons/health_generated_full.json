    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "In the early stages like Precontemplation, individuals are often unaware or resistant to change.

    "explanation": "The TTM emphasizes that change is rarely linear and that individuals may cycle back through earlier stages, especially experiencing relapse.

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "While alcohol may initially sedate, Walker clarifies that it fragments sleep, making it less restorative, and critically suppresses REM sleep.

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Walker emphasizes that many common sleep aids are sedatives that do not produce natural sleep.

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Walker advocates for associating the bed with sleep. If sleep doesn't come within a reasonable time (e.g., 20 minutes), it's best to get out of bed, do a quiet, non-stimulating activity in another room, and return to bed only when truly sleepy.

    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Traditional gender roles can restrict women's access to education, economic independence, and decision-making power, which are key social determinants of health.

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "This paradox is partly explained by gendered health behaviors, where women are often more likely to seek medical attention and report symptoms for chronic but non-fatal conditions, while men may delay seeking care, leading to higher mortality rates from more acute issues. Social expectations influence both reporting and seeking behavior (Annandale & Hunt, 2000).",
