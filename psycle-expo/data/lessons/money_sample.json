    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Research generally indicates that increased income significantly improves subjective well-being by meeting basic needs and providing security, but these gains tend to diminish or plateau once a comfortable income level is reached (Furnham, 2014).

    "explanation": "Cultural values and norms play a crucial role in shaping an individual's financial socialization, influencing their attitudes towards saving, spending, debt, risk-taking, and the symbolic meaning attributed to money (Furnham, 2014).

      "The psychological impact of money is solely dependent on an individual's net worth."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer's core argument challenges traditional economic views by demonstrating that money is not simply a neutral, interchangeable medium. Instead, its meaning and use are shaped by social contexts, moral frameworks, and cultural practices (Zelizer, 1994). This makes money far more complex than a mere economic instrument.",

    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Earmarking, as described by Zelizer, is the process by which individuals and groups mentally or formally assign specific purposes to different sums of money. This act limits money's fungibility, meaning that funds designated for one purpose are not readily interchangeable with funds designated for another, even if they are monetarily equal (Zelizer, 1994).",

      "She suggests that economic models accurately capture money's social complexities."
    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Traditional economics often treats money as a perfectly fungible and neutral tool for exchange. Zelizer directly challenges this by illustrating how social and cultural contexts imbue money with different meanings, making it non-fungible in many real-world social applications (Zelizer, 1994).",

    ],
    "answer_index": 1,
    "explanation": "Zelizer demonstrates that people categorize and differentiate between various types of money based on its source, purpose, or symbolic meaning. This leads to distinct rules for how these 'special monies' can be spent or saved, reflecting underlying social and moral norms rather than purely economic logic (Zelizer, 1994).",

      "Social relations are irrelevant to money's meaning; its value is purely objective.",

    ],
    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer argues that the social context and relationships between individuals profoundly shape how money is perceived and utilized.

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Moralizing money involves attaching ethical judgments or social rules to its acquisition, possession, or expenditure.

    "answer_index": 2,
    "explanation": "Zelizer's work highlights that differentiating money helps maintain social order and moral distinctions. If all money were perfectly interchangeable, the social and moral boundaries people impose on 'blood money,' 'gift money,' or 'dirty money' would collapse, blurring important social categories (Zelizer, 1994).",
