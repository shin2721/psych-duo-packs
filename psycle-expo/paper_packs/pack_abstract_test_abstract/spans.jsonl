Previous research has shown that WM capacity is related to academic performance and executive function.

{"id":"ABS:methods","section":"abstract","text":"A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 120 university students (aged 18-25 years). Participants were randomly assigned to either an adaptive WM training group (n=60) or a control group (n=60). The training group completed 20 sessions of adaptive n-back tasks over 4 weeks, while the control group completed non-adaptive versions. Cognitive assessments included WM capacity, attention, and fluid intelligence, measured at baseline, post-training, and 3-month follow-up.","note":null}
{"id":"ABS:results","section":"abstract","text":"The training group showed significant improvements in WM capacity (p < 0.001) and attention (p = 0.02) compared to controls at post-training. These improvements were maintained at the 3-month follow-up (p < 0.01). However, no significant transfer effects were observed for fluid intelligence (p = 0.15). The training group completed an average of 18.5 sessions (SD = 2.1), with 85% adherence rate. Post-hoc analyses revealed that improvements were stronger in participants with lower baseline WM capacity.","note":null}
